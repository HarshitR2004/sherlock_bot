Watson, M.D.,\nlate of the Army Medical Department.) A Study In Scarlet\nCHAPTER I.\nMr. Sherlock Holmes\nI\nn the year 1878 I took my degree of\nDoctor of Medicine of the University of\nLondon, and proceeded to Netley to go\nthrough the course prescribed for sur-\ngeons in the army. Having completed my studies\nthere, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northum-\nberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regi-\nment was stationed in India at the time, and before\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had bro-\nken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my\ncorps had advanced through the passes, and was\nalready deep in the enemy\u2019s country. I followed,\nhowever, with many other of\ufb01cers who were in the\nsame situation as myself, and succeeded in reach-\ning Candahar in safety, where I found my regi-\nment, and at once entered upon my new duties. The campaign brought honours and promotion\nto many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune\nand disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at\nthe fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck\non the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shat-\ntered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murder-\nous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and\ncourage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw\nme across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing\nme safely to the British lines. Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged\nhardships which I had undergone, I was removed,\nwith a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base\nhospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had al-\nready improved so far as to be able to walk about\nthe wards, and even to bask a little upon the ve-\nrandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever,\nthat curse of our Indian possessions. For months\nmy life was despaired of, and when at last I came\nto myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\nand emaciated that a medical board determined\nthat not a day should be lost in sending me back\nto England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\ntroopship Orontes, and landed a month later on\nPortsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ru-\nined, but with permission from a paternal govern-\nment to spend the next nine months in attempting\nto improve it. I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was\ntherefore as free as air\u2014or as free as an income\nof eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit\na man to be. Under such circumstances, I natu-\nrally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into\nwhich all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are\nirresistibly drained."

        "text": "There I stayed for some time\nat a private hotel in the Strand, leading a com-\nfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such\nmoney as I had, considerably more freely than I\nought. So alarming did the state of my \ufb01nances\nbecome, that I soon realized that I must either\nleave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in\nthe country, or that I must make a complete alter-\nation in my style of living. Choosing the latter al-\nternative, I began by making up my mind to leave\nthe hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\npretentious and less expensive domicile. On the very day that I had come to this con-\nclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when\nsome one tapped me on the shoulder, and turn-\ning round I recognized young Stamford, who had\nbeen a dresser under me at Bart\u2019s. The sight of a\nfriendly face in the great wilderness of London is\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old\ndays Stamford had never been a particular crony\nof mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to\nsee me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him\nto lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started\noff together in a hansom. \u201cWhatever have you been doing with yourself,\nWatson?\u201d he asked in undisguised wonder, as we\nrattled through the crowded London streets. \u201cYou\nare as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\u201d\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures,\nand had hardly concluded it by the time that we\nreached our destination. \u201cPoor devil!\u201d he said, commiseratingly, after he\nhad listened to my misfortunes. \u201cWhat are you up\nto now?\u201d\n\u201cLooking for lodgings,\u201d I answered. \u201cTrying to\nsolve the problem as to whether it is possible to\nget comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d remarked my com-\npanion; \u201cyou are the second man to-day that has\nused that expression to me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who was the \ufb01rst?\u201d I asked. \u201cA fellow who is working at the chemical labo-\nratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning him-\nself this morning because he could not get some-\none to go halves with him in some nice rooms\nwhich he had found, and which were too much\nfor his purse.\u201d\n\u201cBy Jove!\u201d I cried, \u201cif he really wants someone\nto share the rooms and the expense, I am the very\n7\nA Study In Scarlet\nman for him. I should prefer having a partner to\nbeing alone.\u201d\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me\nover his wine-glass. \u201cYou don\u2019t know Sherlock\nHolmes yet,\u201d he said; \u201cperhaps you would not care\nfor him as a constant companion.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, what is there against him?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t say there was anything against\nhim. He is a little queer in his ideas\u2014an enthusi-\nast in some branches of science. As far as I know\nhe is a decent fellow enough.\u201d\n\u201cA medical student, I suppose?\u201d said I."

        "text": "\u201cNo\u2014I have no idea what he intends to go in\nfor. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a\n\ufb01rst-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has\nnever taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but\nhe has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge\nwhich would astonish his professors.\u201d\n\u201cDid you never ask him what he was going in\nfor?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out,\nthough he can be communicative enough when the\nfancy seizes him.\u201d\n\u201cI should like to meet him,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I am to\nlodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of stu-\ndious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet\nto stand much noise or excitement. I had enough\nof both in Afghanistan to last me for the remain-\nder of my natural existence. How could I meet this\nfriend of yours?\u201d\n\u201cHe is sure to be at the laboratory,\u201d returned\nmy companion. \u201cHe either avoids the place for\nweeks, or else he works there from morning to\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together\nafter luncheon.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered, and the conversation\ndrifted away into other channels. As we made our way to the hospital after leav-\ning the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more\nparticulars about the gentleman whom I proposed\nto take as a fellow-lodger. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame me if you don\u2019t get on with\nhim,\u201d he said; \u201cI know nothing more of him than\nI have learned from meeting him occasionally in\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so\nyou must not hold me responsible.\u201d\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get on it will be easy to part com-\npany,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt seems to me, Stamford,\u201d I\nadded, looking hard at my companion, \u201cthat you\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the\nmatter. Is this fellow\u2019s temper so formidable, or\nwhat is it? Don\u2019t be mealy-mouthed about it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not easy to express the inexpressible,\u201d\nhe answered with a laugh. \u201cHolmes is a little\ntoo scienti\ufb01c for my tastes\u2014it approaches to cold-\nbloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a\nlittle pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out\nof malevolence, you understand, but simply out\nof a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate\nidea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that\nhe would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for de\ufb01nite and exact\nknowledge.\u201d\n\u201cVery right too.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but it may be pushed to excess. When\nit comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-\nrooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a\nbizarre shape.\u201d\n\u201cBeating the subjects!\u201d\n\u201cYes, to verify how far bruises may be pro-\nduced after death. I saw him at it with my own\neyes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you say he is not a medical student?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Heaven knows what the objects of his\nstudies are."

        "text": "But here we are, and you must\nform your own impressions about him.\u201d As he\nspoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed\nthrough a small side-door, which opened into a\nwing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground\nto me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the\nbleak stone staircase and made our way down the\nlong corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall\nand dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a\nlow arched passage branched away from it and led\nto the chemical laboratory. This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered\nwith countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scat-\ntered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes,\nand little Bunsen lamps, with their blue \ufb02ickering\n\ufb02ames. There was only one student in the room,\nwho was bending over a distant table absorbed in\nhis work. At the sound of our steps he glanced\nround and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ve found it! I\u2019ve found it,\u201d he shouted to my\ncompanion, running towards us with a test-tube in\nhis hand. \u201cI have found a re-agent which is precip-\nitated by h\u0153moglobin, and by nothing else.\u201d Had\nhe discovered a gold mine, greater delight could\nnot have shone upon his features. \u201cDr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Stam-\nford, introducing us. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he said cordially, gripping\nmy hand with a strength for which I should\n8\nA Study In Scarlet\nhardly have given him credit. \u201cYou have been in\nAfghanistan, I perceive.\u201d\n\u201cHow on earth did you know that?\u201d I asked in\nastonishment. \u201cNever mind,\u201d said he, chuckling to himself. \u201cThe question now is about h\u0153moglobin. No\ndoubt you see the signi\ufb01cance of this discovery of\nmine?\u201d\n\u201cIt is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\u201d I an-\nswered, \u201cbut practically\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy, man, it is the most practical medico-\nlegal discovery for years. Don\u2019t you see that it\ngives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come\nover here now!\u201d He seized me by the coat-sleeve\nin his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at\nwhich he had been working. \u201cLet us have some\nfresh blood,\u201d he said, digging a long bodkin into\nhis \ufb01nger, and drawing off the resulting drop of\nblood in a chemical pipette. \u201cNow, I add this small\nquantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive\nthat the resulting mixture has the appearance of\npure water. The proportion of blood cannot be\nmore than one in a million. I have no doubt, how-\never, that we shall be able to obtain the characteris-\ntic reaction.\u201d As he spoke, he threw into the vessel\na few white crystals, and then added some drops\nof a transparent \ufb02uid. In an instant the contents\nassumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish\ndust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar. \u201cHa! ha!\u201d he cried, clapping his hands, and\nlooking as delighted as a child with a new toy. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to be a very delicate test,\u201d I remarked."

The lat-\nter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood\nis old or new. Had this test been invented, there\nare hundreds of men now walking the earth who\nwould long ago have paid the penalty of their\ncrimes.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d I murmured. \u201cCriminal cases are continually hinging upon\nthat one point. A man is suspected of a crime\nmonths perhaps after it has been committed. His\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains\ndiscovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or\nmud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what\nare they? That is a question which has puzzled\nmany an expert, and why? Because there was no\nreliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes\u2019\ntest, and there will no longer be any dif\ufb01culty.\u201d\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put\nhis hand over his heart and bowed as if to some ap-\nplauding crowd conjured up by his imagination. \u201cYou are to be congratulated,\u201d I remarked, con-\nsiderably surprised at his enthusiasm. \u201cThere was the case of Von Bischoff at Frank-\nfort last year. He would certainly have been hung\nhad this test been in existence. Then there was\nMason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and\nLefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of new Or-\nleans. I could name a score of cases in which it\nwould have been decisive.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\u201d\nsaid Stamford with a laugh. \u201cYou might start a pa-\nper on those lines. Call it the \u2018Police News of the\nPast.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cVery interesting reading it might be made,\ntoo,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small\npiece of plaster over the prick on his \ufb01nger. \u201cI have\nto be careful,\u201d he continued, turning to me with a\nsmile, \u201cfor I dabble with poisons a good deal.\u201d He\nheld out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it\nwas all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,\nand discoloured with strong acids. \u201cWe came here on business,\u201d said Stamford, sit-\nting down on a high three-legged stool, and push-\ning another one in my direction with his foot. \u201cMy\nfriend here wants to take diggings, and as you\nwere complaining that you could get no one to go\nhalves with you, I thought that I had better bring\nyou together.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea\nof sharing his rooms with me. \u201cI have my eye on a\nsuite in Baker Street,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich would suit\nus down to the ground. You don\u2019t mind the smell\nof strong tobacco, I hope?\u201d\n\u201cI always smoke \u2018ship\u2019s\u2019 myself,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough. I generally have chem-\nicals about,\nand occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?\u201d\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see\u2014what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don\u2019t open my\nmouth for days on end."

I\u2019ll wager he learns more about\nyou than you about him. Good-bye.\u201d\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d I answered, and strolled on to my\nhotel, considerably interested in my new acquain-\ntance. CHAPTER II. The Science Of Deduction\nWe met next day as he had arranged, and in-\nspected the rooms at No. 221b, Baker Street, of\nwhich he had spoken at our meeting. They con-\nsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and\na single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully fur-\nnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments,\nand so moderate did the terms seem when divided\nbetween us, that the bargain was concluded upon\nthe spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from\nthe hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock\nHolmes followed me with several boxes and port-\nmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily em-\nployed in unpacking and laying out our property\nto the best advantage. That done, we gradually be-\ngan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves\nto our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a dif\ufb01cult man to live\nwith."

It was rare for him to be up after ten\nat night, and he had invariably breakfasted and\ngone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes\nhe spent his day at the chemical laboratory, some-\ntimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in\nlong walks, which appeared to take him into the\nlowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed\nhis energy when the working \ufb01t was upon him;\nbut now and again a reaction would seize him, and\nfor days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the\nsitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a\nmuscle from morning to night. On these occasions\nI have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in\nhis eyes, that I might have suspected him of being\naddicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the\ntemperance and cleanliness of his whole life for-\nbidden such a notion. As the weeks went by, my interest in him and\nmy curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deep-\nened and increased. His very person and appear-\nance were such as to strike the attention of the\nmost casual observer. In height he was rather over\nsix feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to\nbe considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to\nwhich I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose\ngave his whole expression an air of alertness and\ndecision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and\n10\nA Study In Scarlet\nstained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of ex-\ntraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\noccasion to observe when I watched him manipu-\nlating his fragile philosophical instruments. The reader may set me down as a hopeless\nbusybody, when I confess how much this man\nstimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeav-\noured to break through the reticence which he\nshowed on all that concerned himself. Before pro-\nnouncing judgment, however, be it remembered,\nhow objectless was my life, and how little there\nwas to engage my attention. My health forbade me\nfrom venturing out unless the weather was excep-\ntionally genial, and I had no friends who would\ncall upon me and break the monotony of my daily\nexistence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly\nhailed the little mystery which hung around my\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeav-\nouring to unravel it. He was not studying medicine. He had him-\nself, in reply to a question, con\ufb01rmed Stamford\u2019s\nopinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\nhave pursued any course of reading which might\n\ufb01t him for a degree in science or any other recog-\nnized portal which would give him an entrance\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain\nstudies was remarkable, and within eccentric lim-\nits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample\nand minute that his observations have fairly as-\ntounded me."

His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowl-\nedge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and\npolitics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired\nin the naivest way who he might be and what he\nhad done.

I pondered over our short conversa-\ntion, however, and endeavoured to draw my de-\nductions from it. He said that he would acquire\nno knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed\nwas such as would be useful to him.

During the \ufb01rst week or so we had no callers,\nand I had begun to think that my companion was\nas friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances,\nand those in the most different classes of society.

When\nany of these nondescript individuals put in an ap-\npearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use\nof the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-\nroom. He always apologized to me for putting me\nto this inconvenience. \u201cI have to use this room as a\nplace of business,\u201d he said, \u201cand these people are\nmy clients.\u201d Again I had an opportunity of asking\nhim a point blank question, and again my delicacy\nprevented me from forcing another man to con\ufb01de\nin me. I imagined at the time that he had some\nstrong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon\ndispelled the idea by coming round to the subject\nof his own accord. It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good\nreason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier\nthan usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had\nnot yet \ufb01nished his breakfast. The landlady had\nbecome so accustomed to my late habits that my\nplace had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I\nrang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was\nready. Then I picked up a magazine from the ta-\nble and attempted to while away the time with it,\nwhile my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the head-\ning, and I naturally began to run my eye through\nit. Its somewhat ambitious title was \u201cThe Book of\nLife,\u201d and it attempted to show how much an ob-\nservant man might learn by an accurate and sys-\ntematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of\nshrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was\nclose and intense, but the deductions appeared to\nme to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer\nclaimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a\nmuscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man\u2019s\ninmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an\nimpossibility in the case of one trained to observa-\ntion and analysis. His conclusions were as infalli-\nble as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling\nwould his results appear to the uninitiated that un-\ntil they learned the processes by which he had ar-\nrived at them they might well consider him as a\nnecromancer. \u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca lo-\ngician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or\na Niagara without having seen or heard of one or\nthe other. So all life is a great chain, the nature\nof which is known whenever we are shown a sin-\ngle link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of\nDeduction and Analysis is one which can only be\nacquired by long and patient study nor is life long\nenough to allow any mortal to attain the highest\n12\nA Study In Scarlet\npossible perfection in it."

No answer? Right, sir.\u201d\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand\nin a salute, and was gone. CHAPTER III. The Lauriston Garden Mystery\nI confess that I was considerably startled by\nthis fresh proof of the practical nature of my\ncompanion\u2019s theories. My respect for his powers\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still re-\nmained some lurking suspicion in my mind, how-\never, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what\nearthly object he could have in taking me in was\npast my comprehension. When I looked at him\nhe had \ufb01nished reading the note, and his eyes had\nassumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which\nshowed mental abstraction."

It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-\ncoloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking\n15\nA Study In Scarlet\nlike the re\ufb02ection of the mud-coloured streets be-\nneath. My companion was in the best of spirits,\nand prattled away about Cremona \ufb01ddles, and the\ndifference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather\nand the melancholy business upon which we were\nengaged, depressed my spirits. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to give much thought to\nthe matter in hand,\u201d I said at last, interrupting\nHolmes\u2019 musical disquisition. \u201cNo data yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is a capital mis-\ntake to theorize before you have all the evidence.

A small gar-\nden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of\nsickly plants separated each of these houses from\nthe street, and was traversed by a narrow path-\nway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently\nof a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole\nplace was very sloppy from the rain which had\nfallen through the night. The garden was bounded\nby a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood\nrails upon the top, and against this wall was lean-\ning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a\nsmall knot of loafers, who craned their necks and\nstrained their eyes in the vain hope of catching\nsome glimpse of the proceedings within. I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would\nat once have hurried into the house and plunged\ninto a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to\nbe further from his intention. With an air of non-\nchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed\nto me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the\nground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line\nof railings. Having \ufb01nished his scrutiny, he pro-\nceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the\nfringe of grass which \ufb02anked the path, keeping his\neyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped,\nand once I saw him smile, and heard him utter\nan exclamation of satisfaction. There were many\nmarks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but\nsince the police had been coming and going over\nit, I was unable to see how my companion could\nhope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such\nextraordinary evidence of the quickness of his per-\nceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could\nsee a great deal which was hidden from me. At the door of the house we were met by a\ntall, white-faced, \ufb02axen-haired man, with a note-\nbook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung\nmy companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed\nkind of you to come,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had every-\nthing left untouched.\u201d\n\u201cExcept that!\u201d my friend answered, pointing at\nthe pathway. \u201cIf a herd of buffaloes had passed\nalong there could not be a greater mess.

Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satis\ufb01ed\nway. \u201cI think we have done all that can be done,\u201d\nhe answered; \u201cit\u2019s a queer case though, and I knew\nyour taste for such things.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not come here in a cab?\u201d asked Sher-\nlock Holmes."

A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led\nto the kitchen and of\ufb01ces. Two doors opened out\nof it to the left and to the right. One of these had\nobviously been closed for many weeks. The other\nbelonged to the dining-room, which was the apart-\nment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\nsubdued feeling at my heart which the presence of\ndeath inspires. It was a large square room, looking all the\nlarger from the absence of all furniture. A vul-\ngar \ufb02aring paper adorned the walls, but it was\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there\n16\nA Study In Scarlet\ngreat strips had become detached and hung down,\nexposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the\ndoor was a showy \ufb01replace, surmounted by a man-\ntelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner\nof this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light\nwas hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge\nto everything, which was intensi\ufb01ed by the thick\nlayer of dust which coated the whole apartment. All these details I observed afterwards. At\npresent my attention was centred upon the sin-\ngle grim motionless \ufb01gure which lay stretched\nupon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes star-\ning up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a\nman about forty-three or forty-four years of age,\nmiddle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curl-\ning black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He\nwas dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and\nwaistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and im-\nmaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed\nand trim, was placed upon the \ufb02oor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown\nabroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked\nas though his death struggle had been a grievous\none. On his rigid face there stood an expression\nof horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such\nas I have never seen upon human features. This\nmalignant and terrible contortion, combined with\nthe low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous\njaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and\nape-like appearance, which was increased by his\nwrithing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in\nmany forms, but never has it appeared to me in\na more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main\narteries of suburban London. Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was\nstanding by the doorway, and greeted my compan-\nion and myself. \u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I have seen, and I am no\nchicken.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no clue?\u201d said Gregson. \u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade.

It reminds me of the cir-\ncumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen,\nin Utrecht, in the year \u201934.

So swiftly was the examination\nmade, that one would hardly have guessed the\nminuteness with which it was conducted.

The murderer has written it with his or her\nown blood. See this smear where it has trickled\ndown the wall! That disposes of the idea of sui-\ncide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write\nit on? I will tell you. See that candle on the man-\ntelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this\ncorner would be the brightest instead of the dark-\nest portion of the wall.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does it mean now that you have\nfound it?\u201d asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice. \u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was\ngoing to put the female name Rachel, but was\ndisturbed before he or she had time to \ufb01nish.

Sherlock Holmes led me to the\nnearest telegraph of\ufb01ce, whence he dispatched a\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered\nthe driver to take us to the address given us by\nLestrade. \u201cThere is nothing like \ufb01rst hand evidence,\u201d he\nremarked; \u201cas a matter of fact, my mind is entirely\nmade up upon the case, but still we may as well\nlearn all that is to be learned.\u201d\n\u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you\nare not as sure as you pretend to be of all those\nparticulars which you gave.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very \ufb01rst thing which I observed on arriving\nthere was that a cab had made two ruts with its\nwheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we\nhave had no rain for a week, so that those wheels\nwhich left such a deep impression must have been\nthere during the night. There were the marks of\nthe horse\u2019s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which\nwas far more clearly cut than that of the other\nthree, showing that that was a new shoe. Since\nthe cab was there after the rain began, and was\nnot there at any time during the morning\u2014I have\nGregson\u2019s word for that\u2014it follows that it must\n19\nA Study In Scarlet\nhave been there during the night, and, therefore,\nthat it brought those two individuals to the house.\u201d\n\u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how\nabout the other man\u2019s height?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out\nof ten, can be told from the length of his stride."

Then I had a way of checking my cal-\nculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct\nleads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the\nground. It was child\u2019s play.\u201d\n\u201cAnd his age?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet\nwithout the smallest effort, he can\u2019t be quite in\nthe sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a\npuddle on the garden walk which he had evi-\ndently walked across. Patent-leather boots had\ngone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply\napplying to ordinary life a few of those precepts\nof observation and deduction which I advocated\nin that article. Is there anything else that puzzles\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cThe \ufb01nger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I sug-\ngested. \u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a\nman\u2019s fore\ufb01nger dipped in blood. My glass al-\nlowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been\nthe case if the man\u2019s nail had been trimmed. I\ngathered up some scattered ash from the \ufb02oor. It\nwas dark in colour and \ufb02akey\u2014such an ash as is\nonly made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a spe-\ncial study of cigar ashes\u2014in fact, I have written a\nmonograph upon the subject. I \ufb02atter myself that\nI can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known\nbrand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in\nsuch details that the skilled detective differs from\nthe Gregson and Lestrade type.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the \ufb02orid face?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, that was a more daring shot, though I\nhave no doubt that I was right. You must not ask\nme that at the present state of the affair.\u201d\nI passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head\nis in a whirl,\u201d I remarked; \u201cthe more one thinks\nof it the more mysterious it grows. How came\nthese two men\u2014if there were two men\u2014into an\nempty house? What has become of the cabman\nwho drove them? How could one man compel an-\nother to take poison? Where did the blood come\nfrom? What was the object of the murderer, since\nrobbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s\nring there? Above all, why should the second\nman write up the German word RACHE before\ndecamping? I confess that I cannot see any possi-\nble way of reconciling all these facts.\u201d\nMy companion smiled approvingly. \u201cYou sum up the dif\ufb01culties of the situation\nsuccinctly and well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is much that\nis still obscure, though I have quite made up my\nmind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\u2019s dis-\ncovery it was simply a blind intended to put the\npolice upon a wrong track, by suggesting Social-\nism and secret societies."

The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle\npaved with \ufb02ags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty chil-\ndren, and through lines of discoloured linen, until\nwe came to Number 46, the door of which was\ndecorated with a small slip of brass on which the\nname Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found\nthat the constable was in bed, and we were shown\ninto a little front parlour to await his coming.

At eleven there was a \ufb01ght at the \u2018White\nHart\u2019; but bar that all was quiet enough on the\nbeat.

Presently\u2014maybe about two\nor a little after\u2014I thought I would take a look\nround and see that all was right down the Brix-\nton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a\nsoul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or\ntwo went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four\nof gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of\na light caught my eye in the window of that same\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lau-\nriston Gardens was empty on account of him that\nowns them who won\u2019t have the drains seed to,\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of\nthem died o\u2019 typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a\nheap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and\nI suspected as something was wrong. When I got\nto the door\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou stopped, and then walked back to the gar-\nden gate,\u201d my companion interrupted. \u201cWhat did\nyou do that for?\u201d\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sher-\nlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his\nfeatures. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s true, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cthough how\nyou come to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see,\nwhen I got up to the door it was so still and so\nlonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for\nsome one with me. I ain\u2019t afeared of anything on\nthis side o\u2019 the grave; but I thought that maybe it\nwas him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the\ndrains what killed him. The thought gave me a\nkind o\u2019 turn, and I walked back to the gate to see\nif I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but there wasn\u2019t\nno sign of him nor of anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no one in the street?\u201d\n\u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog.

So sinister\nwas the impression which that face had produced\nupon me that I found it dif\ufb01cult to feel anything\nbut gratitude for him who had removed its owner\nfrom the world. If ever human features bespoke\nvice of the most malignant type, they were cer-\ntainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still\n22\nA Study In Scarlet\nI recognized that justice must be done, and that\nthe depravity of the victim was no condonement\nin the eyes of the law. The more I thought of it the more extraordinary\ndid my companion\u2019s hypothesis, that the man had\nbeen poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had\nsniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had de-\ntected something which had given rise to the idea.

Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair\nin the direction of the door. We heard the servant\npass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch\nas she opened it. \u201cDoes Dr. Watson live here?\u201d asked a clear but\nrather harsh voice. We could not hear the servant\u2019s\nreply, but the door closed, and some one began to\nascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain\nand shuf\ufb02ing one. A look of surprise passed over\nthe face of my companion as he listened to it. It\ncame slowly along the passage, and there was a\nfeeble tap at the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d I cried. At my summons, instead of the man of vio-\nlence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled\nwoman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared\nto be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and\nafter dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us\nwith her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\nwith nervous, shaky \ufb01ngers. I glanced at my com-\npanion, and his face had assumed such a discon-\nsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep\nmy countenance. The old crone drew out an evening paper, and\npointed at our advertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s this as has\nbrought me, good gentlemen,\u201d she said, dropping\nanother curtsey; \u201ca gold wedding ring in the Brix-\nton Road. It belongs to my girl Sally, as was mar-\nried only this time twelvemonth, which her hus-\nband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what\nhe\u2019d say if he comes \u2019ome and found her without\nher ring is more than I can think, he being short\nenough at the best o\u2019 times, but more especially\nwhen he has the drink. If it please you, she went\nto the circus last night along with\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIs that her ring?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe Lord be thanked!\u201d cried the old woman;\n\u201cSally will be a glad woman this night. That\u2019s the\nring.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what may your address be?\u201d I inquired,\ntaking up a pencil. \u201c13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary\nway from here.\u201d\n\u201cThe Brixton Road does not lie between any\ncircus and Houndsditch,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes\nsharply. The old woman faced round and looked keenly\nat him from her little red-rimmed eyes. \u201cThe gen-\ntleman asked me for my address,\u201d she said. \u201cSally\nlives in lodgings at 3, May\ufb01eld Place, Peckham.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your name is\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Sawyer\u2014her\u2019s is Dennis, which\nTom Dennis married her\u2014and a smart, clean\nlad, too, as long as he\u2019s at sea, and no steward\nin the company more thought of; but when on\nshore, what with the women and what with liquor\nshops\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHere is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\u201d I interrupted,\nin obedience to a sign from my companion; \u201cit\nclearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\u201d\nWith many mumbled blessings and protesta-\ntions of gratitude the old crone packed it away in\nher pocket, and shuf\ufb02ed off down the stairs."

He re-\nturned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster\nand a cravat. \u201cI\u2019ll follow her,\u201d he said, hurriedly;\n\u201cshe must be an accomplice, and will lead me to\nhim. Wait up for me.\u201d The hall door had hardly\n24\nA Study In Scarlet\nslammed behind our visitor before Holmes had\ndescended the stair. Looking through the window\nI could see her walking feebly along the other side,\nwhile her pursuer dogged her some little distance\nbehind. \u201cEither his whole theory is incorrect,\u201d I\nthought to myself, \u201cor else he will be led now to\nthe heart of the mystery.\u201d There was no need for\nhim to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that\nsleep was impossible until I heard the result of his\nadventure. It was close upon nine when he set out. I had\nno idea how long he might be, but I sat stolidly\npuf\ufb01ng at my pipe and skipping over the pages of\nHenri Murger\u2019s Vie de Boh`eme. Ten o\u2019clock passed,\nand I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pat-\ntered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread\nof the landlady passed my door, bound for the\nsame destination. It was close upon twelve before I\nheard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant\nhe entered I saw by his face that he had not been\nsuccessful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be\nstruggling for the mastery, until the former sud-\ndenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty\nlaugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the Scotland Yarders know it\nfor the world,\u201d he cried, dropping into his chair; \u201cI\nhave chaffed them so much that they would never\nhave let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh,\nbecause I know that I will be even with them in the\nlong run.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind telling a story against my-\nself. That creature had gone a little way when she\nbegan to limp and show every sign of being foot-\nsore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a\nfour-wheeler which was passing. I managed to\nbe close to her so as to hear the address, but I\nneed not have been so anxious, for she sang it out\nloud enough to be heard at the other side of the\nstreet, \u2018Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,\u2019\nshe cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought,\nand having seen her safely inside, I perched myself\nbehind. That\u2019s an art which every detective should\nbe an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never\ndrew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and\nstrolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I\nsaw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and\nI saw him open the door and stand expectantly."

When I reached him\nhe was groping about frantically in the empty cab,\nand giving vent to the \ufb01nest assorted collection of\noaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or\ntrace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some\ntime before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Num-\nber 13 we found that the house belonged to a re-\nspectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that\nno one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had\never been heard of there.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say,\u201d I cried, in amazement,\n\u201cthat that tottering, feeble old woman was able to\nget out of the cab while it was in motion, without\neither you or the driver seeing her?\u201d\n\u201cOld\nwoman\nbe\ndamned!\u201d\nsaid\nSherlock\nHolmes, sharply. \u201cWe were the old women to be\nso taken in. It must have been a young man, and\nan active one, too, besides being an incomparable\nactor. The get-up was inimitable. He saw that he\nwas followed, no doubt, and used this means of\ngiving me the slip.

Take my\nadvice and turn in.\u201d\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed\nhis injunction. I left Holmes seated in front of the\nsmouldering \ufb01re, and long into the watches of the\nnight I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his\nviolin, and knew that he was still pondering over\nthe strange problem which he had set himself to\nunravel. 25\nA Study In Scarlet\nCHAPTER VI. Tobias Gregson Shows What He Can Do\nThe papers next day were full of the \u201cBrixton\nMystery,\u201d as they termed it. Each had a long ac-\ncount of the affair, and some had leaders upon\nit in addition. There was some information in\nthem which was new to me. I still retain in my\nscrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bear-\ning upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few\nof them:\u2014\nThe Daily Telegraph remarked that in the history\nof crime there had seldom been a tragedy which\npresented stranger features. The German name of\nthe victim, the absence of all other motive, and the\nsinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its\nperpetration by political refugees and revolution-\nists. The Socialists had many branches in America,\nand the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their\nunwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua to-\nfana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,\nthe Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus,\nand the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article con-\ncluded by admonishing the Government and ad-\nvocating a closer watch over foreigners in England. The Standard commented upon the fact that\nlawless outrages of the sort usually occurred un-\nder a Liberal Administration. They arose from the\nunsettling of the minds of the masses, and the con-\nsequent weakening of all authority."

He had\nstayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charp-\nentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was\naccompanied in his travels by his private secre-\ntary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to\ntheir landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and de-\nparted to Euston Station with the avowed intention\nof catching the Liverpool express. They were after-\nwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing\nmore is known of them until Mr. Drebber\u2019s body\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in\nthe Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How\nhe came there, or how he met his fate, are ques-\ntions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing\nis known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We\nare glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Greg-\nson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the\ncase, and it is con\ufb01dently anticipated that these\nwell-known of\ufb01cers will speedily throw light upon\nthe matter. The Daily News observed that there was no\ndoubt as to the crime being a political one. The\ndespotism and hatred of Liberalism which ani-\nmated the Continental Governments had had the\neffect of driving to our shores a number of men\nwho might have made excellent citizens were they\nnot soured by the recollection of all that they had\nundergone. Among these men there was a strin-\ngent code of honour, any infringement of which\nwas punished by death. Every effort should be\nmade to \ufb01nd the secretary, Stangerson, and to as-\ncertain some particulars of the habits of the de-\nceased. A great step had been gained by the dis-\ncovery of the address of the house at which he had\nboarded\u2014a result which was entirely due to the\nacuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland\nYard. Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over\ntogether at breakfast, and they appeared to afford\nhim considerable amusement. \u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade\nand Gregson would be sure to score.\u201d\n\u201cThat depends on how it turns out.\u201d\n\u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least. If\nthe man is caught, it will be on account of their ex-\nertions; if he escapes, it will be in spite of their exer-\ntions. It\u2019s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever\nthey do, they will have followers. \u2018Un sot trouve\ntoujours un plus sot qui l\u2019admire.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d I cried, for at this mo-\nment there came the pattering of many steps in the\nhall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible ex-\npressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady. \u201cIt\u2019s the Baker Street division of the detective\npolice force,\u201d said my companion, gravely; and as\nhe spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen\nof the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that\never I clapped eyes on. \u201c\u2019Tention!\u201d cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and\nthe six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so\nmany disreputable statuettes."

Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and re-\nlaxed into a smile. \u201cTake a seat, and try one of these cigars,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cWe are anxious to know how you managed\nit. Will you have some whiskey and water?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d the detective answered. \u201cThe tremendous exertions which I have gone\nthrough during the last day or two have worn me\nout. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand,\nas the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate\nthat, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-\nworkers.\u201d\n\u201cYou do me too much honour,\u201d said Holmes,\ngravely. \u201cLet us hear how you arrived at this most\ngratifying result.\u201d\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair,\nand puffed complacently at his cigar.

He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson,\nhad been travelling on the Continent.

Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but\nhis employer, I am sorry to say, was far other-\nwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in\nhis ways. The very night of his arrival he became\nvery much the worse for drink, and, indeed, af-\nter twelve o\u2019clock in the day he could hardly ever\nbe said to be sober. His manners towards the\nmaid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same atti-\ntude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her\nmore than once in a way which, fortunately, she\nis too innocent to understand. On one occasion\nhe actually seized her in his arms and embraced\nher\u2014an outrage which caused his own secretary\nto reproach him for his unmanly conduct.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018But why did you stand all this,\u2019 I asked. \u2018I\nsuppose that you can get rid of your boarders\nwhen you wish.\u2019\n\u201cMrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent\nquestion. \u2018Would to God that I had given him no-\ntice on the very day that he came,\u2019 she said. \u2018But it\nwas a sore temptation. They were paying a pound\na day each\u2014fourteen pounds a week, and this is\nthe slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in\nthe Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose\nthe money. I acted for the best. This last was too\nmuch, however, and I gave him notice to leave on\naccount of it."

When\nI closed the door behind them a load seemed to\nbe lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an\nhour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned\nthat Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much ex-\ncited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced\nhis way into the room, where I was sitting with\nmy daughter, and made some incoherent remark\nabout having missed his train.

We had said nothing to him\nabout it, so that his alluding to it had a most sus-\npicious aspect.\u201d\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe still carried the heavy stick which the\nmother described him as having with him when\nhe followed Drebber.

When there, a fresh alter-\ncation arose between them, in the course of which\nDrebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit\nof the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without\nleaving any mark. The night was so wet that no\none was about, so Charpentier dragged the body\nof his victim into the empty house.

He had evidently come with the inten-\ntion of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on\nperceiving his colleague he appeared to be embar-\nrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the\nroom, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncer-\ntain what to do. \u201cThis is a most extraordinary\ncase,\u201d he said at last\u2014\u201ca most incomprehensible\naffair.\u201d\n\u201cAh, you \ufb01nd it so, Mr. Lestrade!\u201d cried Greg-\nson, triumphantly. \u201cI thought you would come to\nthat conclusion.

This fresh development has shown me\nthat I was completely mistaken. Full of the one\nidea, I set myself to \ufb01nd out what had become of\nthe Secretary. They had been seen together at Eu-\nston Station about half-past eight on the evening of\nthe third. At two in the morning Drebber had been\nfound in the Brixton Road. The question which\nconfronted me was to \ufb01nd out how Stangerson had\nbeen employed between 8.30 and the time of the\ncrime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description\nof the man, and warning them to keep a watch\nupon the American boats. I then set to work call-\ning upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the\nvicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Dreb-\nber and his companion had become separated, the\nnatural course for the latter would be to put up\nsomewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then\nto hang about the station again next morning.\u201d\n\u201cThey would be likely to agree on some\nmeeting-place beforehand,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cSo it proved. I spent the whole of yester-\nday evening in making enquiries entirely without\navail. This morning I began very early, and at eight\no\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little\nGeorge Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr.\nStangerson was living there, they at once answered\nme in the af\ufb01rmative. \u201c \u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he\nwas expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He has been waiting\nfor a gentleman for two days.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Where is he now?\u2019 I asked. \u201c \u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called\nat nine.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said. \u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance\nmight shake his nerves and lead him to say some-\nthing unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show\nme the room: it was on the second \ufb02oor, and there\nwas a small corridor leading up to it."

From under the door there curled a little red\nribbon of blood, which had meandered across the\npassage and formed a little pool along the skirt-\ning at the other side. I gave a cry, which brought\nthe Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our\nshoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window\nof the room was open, and beside the window, all\nhuddled up, lay the body of a man in his night-\ndress. He was quite dead, and had been for some\ntime, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we\nturned him over, the Boots recognized him at once\nas being the same gentleman who had engaged the\nroom under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The\ncause of death was a deep stab in the left side,\nwhich must have penetrated the heart. And now\ncomes the strangest part of the affair. What do you\nsuppose was above the murdered man?\u201d\nI felt a creeping of the \ufb02esh, and a presentiment\nof coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes an-\nswered. \u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck\nvoice; and we were all silent for a while. There was something so methodical and so in-\ncomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown\nassassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his\ncrimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on\nthe \ufb01eld of battle tingled as I thought of it. \u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA\nmilk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, hap-\npened to walk down the lane which leads from\n30\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed\nthat a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised\nagainst one of the windows of the second \ufb02oor,\nwhich was wide open. After passing, he looked\nback and saw a man descend the ladder. He came\ndown so quietly and openly that the boy imagined\nhim to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the\nhotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond\nthinking in his own mind that it was early for him\nto be at work. He has an impression that the man\nwas tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in\na long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in\nthe room some little time after the murder, for we\nfound blood-stained water in the basin, where he\nhad washed his hands, and marks on the sheets\nwhere he had deliberately wiped his knife.\u201d\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description\nof the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his\nown. There was, however, no trace of exultation or\nsatisfaction upon his face."

Whatever the\nmotives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is\ncertainly not one of them. There were no papers\nor memoranda in the murdered man\u2019s pocket, ex-\ncept a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about\na month ago, and containing the words, \u2018J.

The man\u2019s novel,\nwith which he had read himself to sleep was lying\nupon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside\nhim. There was a glass of water on the table, and\non the window-sill a small chip ointment box con-\ntaining a couple of pills.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an\nexclamation of delight. \u201cThe last link,\u201d he cried, exultantly. \u201cMy case\nis complete.\u201d\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement. \u201cI have now in my hands,\u201d my companion said,\ncon\ufb01dently, \u201call the threads which have formed\nsuch a tangle. There are, of course, details to be\n\ufb01lled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts,\nfrom the time that Drebber parted from Stanger-\nson at the station, up to the discovery of the body\nof the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?\u201d\n\u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small\nwhite box; \u201cI took them and the purse and the\ntelegram, intending to have them put in a place\nof safety at the Police Station. It was the merest\nchance my taking these pills, for I am bound to\nsay that I do not attach any importance to them.\u201d\n\u201cGive them here,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, Doc-\ntor,\u201d turning to me, \u201care those ordinary pills?\u201d\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly\ngrey colour, small, round, and almost transparent\nagainst the light. \u201cFrom their lightness and trans-\nparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in\nwater,\u201d I remarked. \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d answered Holmes. \u201cNow would\nyou mind going down and fetching that poor little\ndevil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and\nwhich the landlady wanted you to put out of its\npain yesterday.\u201d\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstair\nin my arms. It\u2019s laboured breathing and glazing\neye showed that it was not far from its end. In-\ndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it\nhad already exceeded the usual term of canine ex-\nistence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug. \u201cI will now cut one of these pills in two,\u201d said\nHolmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the\naction to the word."

He gnawed his lip, drummed\nhis \ufb01ngers upon the table, and showed every other\nsymptom of acute impatience. So great was his\nemotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while\nthe two detectives smiled derisively, by no means\ndispleased at this check which he had met. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d he cried, at last\nspringing from his chair and pacing wildly up and\ndown the room; \u201cit is impossible that it should be\na mere coincidence. The very pills which I sus-\npected in the case of Drebber are actually found\nafter the death of Stangerson. And yet they are\ninert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain\nof reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossi-\nble! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\u201d With a perfect shriek of de-\nlight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two,\ndissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the\nterrier. The unfortunate creature\u2019s tongue seemed\nhardly to have been moistened in it before it gave\na convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\nand lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and\nwiped the perspiration from his forehead. \u201cI\nshould have more faith,\u201d he said; \u201cI ought to know\nby this time that when a fact appears to be op-\nposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably\nproves to be capable of bearing some other inter-\npretation.

It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind\nwere gradually clearing away, and I began to have\na dim, vague perception of the truth. \u201cAll this seems strange to you,\u201d continued\nHolmes, \u201cbecause you failed at the beginning of\nthe inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the\ngood fortune to seize upon that, and everything\nwhich has occurred since then has served to con-\n\ufb01rm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the\nlogical sequence of it. Hence things which have\nperplexed you and made the case more obscure,\nhave served to enlighten me and to strengthen\nmy conclusions. It is a mistake to confound\nstrangeness with mystery.

A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasion-\nally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-\ngrounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad\nto lose sight of those awesome plains, and to \ufb01nd\nthemselves once more upon their prairies. The\ncoyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard \ufb02aps\nheavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly\nbear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks\nup such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In the whole world there can be no more dreary\nview than that from the northern slope of the\nSierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches\nthe great \ufb02at plain-land, all dusted over with\npatches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the\ndwar\ufb01sh chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge\nof the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\nwith their rugged summits \ufb02ecked with snow. In\nthis great stretch of country there is no sign of life,\nnor of anything appertaining to life. There is no\nbird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon\nthe dull, grey earth\u2014above all, there is absolute si-\nlence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a\nsound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but\nsilence\u2014complete and heart-subduing silence. It has been said there is nothing appertaining\nto life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a\npathway traced out across the desert, which winds\naway and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rut-\nted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of\nmany adventurers. Here and there there are scat-\ntered white objects which glisten in the sun, and\nstand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Ap-\nproach, and examine them! They are bones: some\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to\nmen. For \ufb01fteen hundred miles one may trace this\nghastly caravan route by these scattered remains\nof those who had fallen by the wayside. Looking down on this very scene, there stood\nupon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and\nforty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\nwas such that he might have been the very genius\nor demon of the region. An observer would have\nfound it dif\ufb01cult to say whether he was nearer to\nforty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard,\nand the brown parchment-like skin was drawn\ntightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown\nhair and beard were all \ufb02ecked and dashed with\nwhite; his eyes were sunken in his head, and\nburned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand\nwhich grasped his ri\ufb02e was hardly more \ufb02eshy\nthan that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned\nupon his weapon for support, and yet his tall \ufb01g-\nure and the massive framework of his bones sug-\ngested a wiry and vigorous constitution."

The man was dying\u2014dying from hunger\nand from thirst. He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and\non to this little elevation, in the vain hope of see-\ning some signs of water. Now the great salt plain\nstretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\nsavage mountains, without a sign anywhere of\nplant or tree, which might indicate the presence\nof moisture. In all that broad landscape there was\nno gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he\nlooked with wild questioning eyes, and then he\nrealised that his wanderings had come to an end,\nand that there, on that barren crag, he was about\nto die. \u201cWhy not here, as well as in a feather bed,\ntwenty years hence,\u201d he muttered, as he seated\nhimself in the shelter of a boulder.

Her chubby face, and his haggard, angu-\nlar visage were both turned up to the cloudless\nheaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being\nwith whom they were face to face, while the two\nvoices\u2014the one thin and clear, the other deep and\nharsh\u2014united in the entreaty for mercy and for-\ngiveness.

He watched over her slumber for some\ntime, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed\nhimself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids\ndrooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk\nlower and lower upon the breast, until the man\u2019s\ngrizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of\nhis companion, and both slept the same deep and\ndreamless slumber. Had the wanderer remained awake for another\nhalf hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain\nthere rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at\n\ufb01rst, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists\nof the distance, but gradually growing higher and\nbroader until it formed a solid, well-de\ufb01ned cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\nbecame evident that it could only be raised by\na great multitude of moving creatures. In more\nfertile spots the observer would have come to the\nconclusion that one of those great herds of bisons\nwhich graze upon the prairie land was approach-\ning him. This was obviously impossible in these\narid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the\nsolitary bluff upon which the two castaways were\nreposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and\nthe \ufb01gures of armed horsemen began to show up\nthrough the haze, and the apparition revealed it-\nself as being a great caravan upon its journey for\nthe West. But what a caravan! When the head\nof it had reached the base of the mountains, the\nrear was not yet visible on the horizon."

At the head of the column there rode a score\nor more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre\nhomespun garments and armed with ri\ufb02es. On\nreaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held\na short council among themselves. \u201cThe wells are to the right, my brothers,\u201d said\none, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly\nhair. \u201cTo the right of the Sierra Blanco\u2014so we shall\nreach the Rio Grande,\u201d said another. \u201cFear not for water,\u201d cried a third. \u201cHe who\ncould draw it from the rocks will not now aban-\ndon His own chosen people.\u201d\n\u201cAmen!

The watchers from the plain below\ncould see them \ufb02it from rock to rock until their\n\ufb01gures stood out against the skyline. The young\nman who had \ufb01rst given the alarm was leading\nthem. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up\nhis hands, as though overcome with astonishment,\nand on joining him they were affected in the same\nway by the sight which met their eyes.

Her rosy lips\nwere parted, showing the regular line of snow-\nwhite teeth within, and a playful smile played over\nher infantile features.

The savage man, and the savage beast,\nhunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease\u2014every imped-\niment which Nature could place in the way\u2014had\nall been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet\nthe long journey and the accumulated terrors had\nshaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.

Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful\nadministrator as well as a resolute chief. Maps\nwere drawn and charts prepared, in which the\nfuture city was sketched out. All around farms\nwere apportioned and allotted in proportion to\nthe standing of each individual. The tradesman\nwas put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if\nby magic. In the country there was draining and\nhedging, planting and clearing, until the next sum-\nmer saw the whole country golden with the wheat\ncrop. Everything prospered in the strange settle-\nment. Above all, the great temple which they had\nerected in the centre of the city grew ever taller\nand larger. From the \ufb01rst blush of dawn until the\nclosing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer\nand the rasp of the saw was never absent from the\nmonument which the immigrants erected to Him\nwho had led them safe through many dangers. The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little\ngirl who had shared his fortunes and had been\nadopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mor-\nmons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little\nLucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough\nin Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which she\nshared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with\nhis son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Hav-\ning rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from\nthe shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon\nbecame a pet with the women, and reconciled her-\nself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered\nhome. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered\n41\nA Study In Scarlet\nfrom his privations, distinguished himself as a use-\nful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly\ndid he gain the esteem of his new companions,\nthat when they reached the end of their wander-\nings, it was unanimously agreed that he should\nbe provided with as large and as fertile a tract of\nland as any of the settlers, with the exception of\nYoung himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, John-\nston, and Drebber, who were the four principal El-\nders."

There were some who accused him of luke-\nwarmness in his adopted religion, and others who\nput it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to\nincur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early\nlove affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined\naway on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the\nreason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every\nother respect he conformed to the religion of the\nyoung settlement, and gained the name of being\nan orthodox and straight-walking man. Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and\nassisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic\nodour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and\nmother to the young girl. As year succeeded to\nyear she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more\nrudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer\nupon the high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm\nfelt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind\nas they watched her lithe girlish \ufb01gure tripping\nthrough the wheat\ufb01elds, or met her mounted upon\nher father\u2019s mustang, and managing it with all the\nease and grace of a true child of the West. So the\nbud blossomed into a \ufb02ower, and the year which\nsaw her father the richest of the farmers left her as\nfair a specimen of American girlhood as could be\nfound in the whole Paci\ufb01c slope. It was not the father, however, who \ufb01rst discov-\nered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change\nis too subtle and too gradual to be measured by\ndates. Least of all does the maiden herself know\nit until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand\nsets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and\na larger nature has awoken within her."

In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion\nwas serious enough in itself, apart from its future\nin\ufb02uence on her destiny and that of many besides. It was a warm June morning, and the Latter\nDay Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive\nthey have chosen for their emblem. In the \ufb01elds\nand in the streets rose the same hum of human in-\ndustry. Down the dusty high roads de\ufb01led long\nstreams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the\nwest, for the gold fever had broken out in Cal-\nifornia, and the Overland Route lay through the\nCity of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep\nand bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture\nlands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and\nhorses equally weary of their interminable jour-\nney. Through all this motley assemblage, thread-\ning her way with the skill of an accomplished rider,\nthere galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face \ufb02ushed\nwith the exercise and her long chestnut hair \ufb02oat-\ning out behind her. She had a commission from\nher father in the City, and was dashing in as she\nhad done many a time before, with all the fearless-\nness of youth, thinking only of her task and how\nit was to be performed. The travel-stained adven-\nturers gazed after her in astonishment, and even\nthe unemotional Indians, journeying in with their\npelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they\nmarvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden. She had reached the outskirts of the city when\nshe found the road blocked by a great drove of cat-\ntle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen\nfrom the plains. In her impatience she endeav-\noured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse\ninto what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had\nshe got fairly into it, however, before the beasts\nclosed in behind her, and she found herself com-\npletely imbedded in the moving stream of \ufb01erce-\neyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she\n42\nA Study In Scarlet\nwas to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at\nher situation, but took advantage of every oppor-\ntunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of push-\ning her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately\nthe horns of one of the creatures, either by acci-\ndent or design, came in violent contact with the\n\ufb02ank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with\na snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way\nthat would have unseated any but a most skilful\nrider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge\nof the excited horse brought it against the horns\nagain, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all\nthat the girl could do to keep herself in the sad-\ndle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under\nthe hoofs of the unwieldy and terri\ufb01ed animals."

He had been accustomed to succeed\nin all that he undertook. He swore in his heart\nthat he would not fail in this if human effort and\nhuman perseverance could render him successful. He called on John Ferrier that night, and many\ntimes again, until his face was a familiar one at\nthe farm-house.

John Ferrier Talks With The Prophet\nThree weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope\nand his comrades had departed from Salt Lake\nCity. John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him\nwhen he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and\nof the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet\nher bright and happy face reconciled him to the\narrangement more than any argument could have\ndone. He had always determined, deep down in\nhis resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce\nhim to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such\na marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as\na shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think\nof the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he\nwas in\ufb02exible. He had to seal his mouth on the\nsubject, however, for to express an unorthodox\nopinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\nthe Land of the Saints. Yes, a dangerous matter\u2014so dangerous that\neven the most saintly dared only whisper their re-\nligious opinions with bated breath, lest something\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued,\nand bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned per-\nsecutors on their own account, and persecutors of\nthe most terrible description. Not the Inquisition\nof Seville, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the\nSecret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a\nmore formidable machinery in motion than that\nwhich cast a cloud over the State of Utah. Its invisibility, and the mystery which was at-\ntached to it, made this organization doubly terri-\nble. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent,\nand yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who\nheld out against the Church vanished away, and\nnone knew whither he had gone or what had be-\nfallen him. His wife and his children awaited him\nat home, but no father ever returned to tell them\nhow he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihi-\nlation, and yet none knew what the nature might\nbe of this terrible power which was suspended\nover them. No wonder that men went about in\nfear and trembling, and that even in the heart of\nthe wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts\nwhich oppressed them. 44\nA Study In Scarlet\nAt \ufb01rst this vague and terrible power was ex-\nercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having\nembraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\nto pervert or to abandon it."

Strange rumours began to\nbe bandied about\u2014rumours of murdered immi-\ngrants and ri\ufb02ed camps in regions where Indians\nhad never been seen. Fresh women appeared in\nthe harems of the Elders\u2014women who pined and\nwept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an un-\nextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the\nmountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\nstealthy, and noiseless, who \ufb02itted by them in\nthe darkness. These tales and rumours took sub-\nstance and shape, and were corroborated and re-\ncorroborated, until they resolved themselves into\na de\ufb01nite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches\nof the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the\nAvenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened\none. Fuller knowledge of the organization which\nproduced such terrible results served to increase\nrather than to lessen the horror which it inspired\nin the minds of men. None knew who belonged\nto this ruthless society. The names of the partic-\nipators in the deeds of blood and violence done\nunder the name of religion were kept profoundly\nsecret. The very friend to whom you communi-\ncated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his\nmission, might be one of those who would come\nforth at night with \ufb01re and sword to exact a terrible\nreparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour,\nand none spoke of the things which were nearest\nhis heart. One \ufb01ne morning, John Ferrier was about to set\nout to his wheat\ufb01elds, when he heard the click of\nthe latch, and, looking through the window, saw\na stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming\nup the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for\nthis was none other than the great Brigham Young\nhimself. Full of trepidation\u2014for he knew that such\na visit boded him little good\u2014Ferrier ran to the\ndoor to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, how-\never, received his salutations coldly, and followed\nhim with a stern face into the sitting-room. \u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and\neyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-\ncoloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you\nwere starving in the desert, we shared our food\nwith you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave\nyou a goodly share of land, and allowed you to\nwax rich under our protection. Is not this so?\u201d\n\u201cIt is so,\u201d answered John Ferrier. \u201cIn return for all this we asked but one condi-\ntion: that was, that you should embrace the true\nfaith, and conform in every way to its usages. This\nyou promised to do, and this, if common report\nsays truly, you have neglected.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how have I neglected it?\u201d asked Ferrier,\nthrowing out his hands in expostulation. \u201cHave\nI not given to the common fund?

You shall rue it to the end of\nyour days.\u201d\n\u201cThe hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon\nyou,\u201d cried young Drebber; \u201cHe will arise and\nsmite you!\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll start the smiting,\u201d exclaimed Ferrier\nfuriously, and would have rushed upstairs for his\ngun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and re-\nstrained him. Before he could escape from her, the\nclatter of horses\u2019 hoofs told him that they were be-\nyond his reach. \u201cThe young canting rascals!\u201d he exclaimed,\nwiping the perspiration from his forehead;\n\u201cI\nwould sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than\nthe wife of either of them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with\nspirit; \u201cbut Jefferson will soon be here.\u201d\n\u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The\nsooner the better, for we do not know what their\nnext move may be.\u201d\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable\nof giving advice and help should come to the aid\nof the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daugh-\nter. In the whole history of the settlement there\nhad never been such a case of rank disobedience\nto the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were\npunished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and posi-\ntion would be of no avail to him. Others as well\nknown and as rich as himself had been spirited\naway before now, and their goods given over to the\nChurch. He was a brave man, but he trembled at\nthe vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a \ufb01rm lip,\nbut this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his\nfears from his daughter, however, and affected to\nmake light of the whole matter, though she, with\nthe keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at\nease. 47\nA Study In Scarlet\nHe expected that he would receive some mes-\nsage or remonstrance from Young as to his con-\nduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in\nan unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morn-\ning he found, to his surprise, a small square of pa-\nper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over\nhis chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling\nletters:\u2014\n\u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amend-\nment, and then\u2014\u201d\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any\nthreat could have been. How this warning came\ninto his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and\nwindows had all been secured. He crumpled the\npaper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the\nincident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-\nnine days were evidently the balance of the month\nwhich Young had promised."

The hand which fas-\ntened that pin might have struck him to the heart,\nand he could never have known who had slain\nhim. Still more shaken was he next morning. They\nhad sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a\ncry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of\nthe ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick ap-\nparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was\nunintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That\nnight he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in\nthe morning a great 27 had been painted upon the\noutside of his door. Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning\ncame he found that his unseen enemies had kept\ntheir register, and had marked up in some con-\nspicuous position how many days were still left to\nhim out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fa-\ntal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes\nupon the \ufb02oors, occasionally they were on small\nplacards stuck upon the garden gate or the rail-\nings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not\ndiscover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came\nupon him at the sight of them. He became hag-\ngard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled\nlook of some hunted creature. He had but one\nhope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the\nyoung hunter from Nevada. Twenty had changed to \ufb01fteen and \ufb01fteen to\nten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by\none the numbers dwindled down, and still there\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clat-\ntered down the road, or a driver shouted at his\nteam, the old farmer hurried to the gate think-\ning that help had arrived at last. At last, when\nhe saw \ufb01ve give way to four and that again to\nthree, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of es-\ncape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowl-\nedge of the mountains which surrounded the set-\ntlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and\nguarded, and none could pass along them with-\nout an order from the Council. Turn which way he\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow\nwhich hung over him. Yet the old man never wa-\nvered in his resolution to part with life itself before\nhe consented to what he regarded as his daugh-\nter\u2019s dishonour. He was sitting alone one evening pondering\ndeeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for\nsome way out of them. That morning had shown\nthe \ufb01gure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the\nnext day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague\nand terrible fancies \ufb01lled his imagination. And his\ndaughter\u2014what was to become of her after he was\ngone?"

In the silence he heard a gen-\ntle scratching sound\u2014low, but very distinct in the\nquiet of the night. It came from the door of the\nhouse. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened in-\ntently. There was a pause for a few moments, and\nthen the low insidious sound was repeated. Some-\none was evidently tapping very gently upon one of\nthe panels of the door. Was it some midnight as-\nsassin who had come to carry out the murderous\norders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had\narrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would\nbe better than the suspense which shook his nerves\nand chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew\nthe bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night\nwas \ufb01ne, and the stars were twinkling brightly\noverhead. The little front garden lay before the\nfarmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but\nneither there nor on the road was any human be-\ning to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked\nto right and to left, until happening to glance\nstraight down at his own feet he saw to his aston-\nishment a man lying \ufb02at upon his face upon the\nground, with arms and legs all asprawl. 48\nA Study In Scarlet\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned\nup against the wall with his hand to his throat to\nsti\ufb02e his inclination to call out. His \ufb01rst thought\nwas that the prostrate \ufb01gure was that of some\nwounded or dying man, but as he watched it he\nsaw it writhe along the ground and into the hall\nwith the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet,\nclosed the door, and revealed to the astonished\nfarmer the \ufb01erce face and resolute expression of\nJefferson Hope. \u201cGood God!\u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you\nscared me! Whatever made you come in like that.\u201d\n\u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI\nhave had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty\nhours.\u201d He \ufb02ung himself upon the cold meat and\nbread which were still lying upon the table from\nhis host\u2019s supper, and devoured it voraciously. \u201cDoes Lucy bear up well?\u201d he asked, when he had\nsatis\ufb01ed his hunger. \u201cYes. She does not know the danger,\u201d her fa-\nther answered. \u201cThat is well. The house is watched on every\nside. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They\nmay be darned sharp, but they\u2019re not quite sharp\nenough to catch a Washoe hunter.\u201d\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he\nrealized that he had a devoted ally.

He had hardly\ncompleted his arrangements before the farmer re-\nturned with his daughter all dressed and ready for\na start.

The lights inside the house had all been extin-\nguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier\npeered over the \ufb01elds which had been his own,\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacri\ufb01ce, how-\never, and the thought of the honour and happiness\nof his daughter outweighed any regret at his ru-\nined fortunes.

Opening the win-\ndow very slowly and carefully, they waited until a\ndark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and\nthen one by one passed through into the little gar-\nden. With bated breath and crouching \ufb01gures they\nstumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the\nhedge, which they skirted until they came to the\ngap which opened into the corn\ufb01elds. They had\njust reached this point when the young man seized\nhis two companions and dragged them down into\nthe shadow, where they lay silent and trembling. It was as well that his prairie training had\ngiven Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and\n49\nA Study In Scarlet\nhis friends had hardly crouched down before the\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard\nwithin a few yards of them, which was imme-\ndiately answered by another hoot at a small dis-\ntance. At the same moment a vague shadowy \ufb01g-\nure emerged from the gap for which they had been\nmaking, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again,\non which a second man appeared out of the ob-\nscurity. \u201cTo-morrow at midnight,\u201d said the \ufb01rst who\nappeared to be in authority. \u201cWhen the Whip-\npoor-Will calls three times.\u201d\n\u201cIt is well,\u201d returned the other. \u201cShall I tell\nBrother Drebber?\u201d\n\u201cPass it on to him, and from him to the others.

Their\nconcluding words had evidently been some form\nof sign and countersign. The instant that their\nfootsteps had died away in the distance, Jeffer-\nson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his com-\npanions through the gap, led the way across the\n\ufb01elds at the top of his speed, supporting and half-\ncarrying the girl when her strength appeared to\nfail her. \u201cHurry on! hurry on!\u201d he gasped from time to\ntime. \u201cWe are through the line of sentinels.

Before reaching the town the hunter\nbranched away into a rugged and narrow foot-\npath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness,\nand the de\ufb01le which led between them was the Ea-\ngle Ca\u02dcnon in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his\nway among the great boulders and along the bed\nof a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the re-\ntired corner, screened with rocks, where the faith-\nful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed\nupon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the\nhorses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope\nled the other along the precipitous and dangerous\npath."

On the one side a great crag towered up\na thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menac-\ning, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged\nsurface like the ribs of some petri\ufb01ed monster. On\nthe other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris\nmade all advance impossible. Between the two ran\nthe irregular track, so narrow in places that they\nhad to travel in Indian \ufb01le, and so rough that only\npractised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet\nin spite of all dangers and dif\ufb01culties, the hearts\nof the fugitives were light within them, for every\nstep increased the distance between them and the\nterrible despotism from which they were \ufb02ying. They soon had a proof, however, that they were\nstill within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They\nhad reached the very wildest and most desolate\nportion of the pass when the girl gave a star-\ntled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which\noverlooked the track, showing out dark and plain\nagainst the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and\nhis military challenge of \u201cWho goes there?\u201d rang\nthrough the silent ravine. \u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope,\nwith his hand upon the ri\ufb02e which hung by his\nsaddle.

Beyond his post the path broad-\nened out, and the horses were able to break into\na trot.

More than once they lost their way, but Hope\u2019s in-\ntimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them\nto regain the track once more. When morning\nbroke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty\nlay before them. In every direction the great snow-\ncapped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each\nother\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were\nthe rocky banks on either side of them, that the\nlarch and the pine seemed to be suspended over\ntheir heads, and to need only a gust of wind to\ncome hurtling down upon them. Nor was the\nfear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was\nthickly strewn with trees and boulders which had\nfallen in a similar manner."

As the sun rose slowly above the eastern hori-\nzon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one\nafter the other, like lamps at a festival, until they\nwere all ruddy and glowing. The magni\ufb01cent\nspectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives\nand gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent\nwhich swept out of a ravine they called a halt and\nwatered their horses, while they partook of a hasty\nbreakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have\nrested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \u201cThey will be upon our track by this time,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything depends upon our speed. Once safe\nin Carson we may rest for the remainder of our\nlives.\u201d\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled\non through the de\ufb01les, and by evening they calcu-\nlated that they were more than thirty miles from\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base\nof a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some\nprotection from the chill wind, and there huddled\ntogether for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019\nsleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and\non their way once more. They had seen no signs\nof any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think\nthat they were fairly out of the reach of the terri-\nble organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach,\nor how soon it was to close upon them and crush\nthem. About the middle of the second day of their\n\ufb02ight their scanty store of provisions began to run\nout. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, how-\never, for there was game to be had among the\nmountains, and he had frequently before had to\ndepend upon his ri\ufb02e for the needs of life. Choos-\ning a sheltered nook, he piled together a few\ndried branches and made a blazing \ufb01re, at which\nhis companions might warm themselves, for they\nwere now nearly \ufb01ve thousand feet above the sea\nlevel, and the air was bitter and keen. Having teth-\nered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw\nhis gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of\nwhatever chance might throw in his way. Look-\ning back he saw the old man and the young girl\ncrouching over the blazing \ufb01re, while the three an-\nimals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then\nthe intervening rocks hid them from his view. He walked for a couple of miles through one\nravine after another without success, though from\nthe marks upon the bark of the trees, and other\nindications, he judged that there were numerous\nbears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three\nhours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of turning\nback in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he\nsaw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through\nhis heart."

The animal sprang into the air, tottered\nfor a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and\nthen came crashing down into the valley beneath. The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the\nhunter contented himself with cutting away one\nhaunch and part of the \ufb02ank. With this trophy\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps,\nfor the evening was already drawing in. He had\nhardly started, however, before he realized the dif-\n\ufb01culty which faced him. In his eagerness he had\nwandered far past the ravines which were known\nto him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the\npath which he had taken.

Convinced that he had taken\nthe wrong turn, he tried another, but with the\nsame result. Night was coming on rapidly, and\nit was almost dark before he at last found him-\nself in a de\ufb01le which was familiar to him. Even\nthen it was no easy matter to keep to the right\ntrack, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high\ncliffs on either side made the obscurity more pro-\nfound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary\nfrom his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up\nhis heart by the re\ufb02ection that every step brought\nhim nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him\nenough to ensure them food for the remainder of\ntheir journey. He had now come to the mouth of the very\nde\ufb01le in which he had left them. Even in the dark-\nness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\nwhich bounded it.

When he turned the corner, he came full in\nsight of the spot where the \ufb01re had been lit. There\nwas still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it\nhad evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With\nhis fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of\nthe \ufb01re: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It\nwas only too clear that some sudden and terrible\ndisaster had occurred during his absence\u2014a disas-\nter which had embraced them all, and yet had left\nno traces behind it. Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jeffer-\nson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to\nlean upon his ri\ufb02e to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and\nspeedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\nsmouldering \ufb01re, he blew it into a \ufb02ame, and pro-\nceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted\nmen had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction\nof their tracks proved that they had afterwards\nturned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried\nback both of his companions with them? Jeffer-\nson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they\nmust have done so, when his eye fell upon an ob-\nject which made every nerve of his body tingle\nwithin him. A little way on one side of the camp\nwas a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had\nassuredly not been there before. There was no mis-\ntaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As\nthe young hunter approached it, he perceived that\na stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of pa-\nper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription\nupon the paper was brief, but to the point:\nJOHN FERRIER,\nFormerly of Salt Lake City,\nDied August 4th, 1860. The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short\na time before, was gone, then, and this was all\nhis epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was\nno sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by\ntheir terrible pursuers to ful\ufb01l her original destiny,\nby becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her\nfate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he\nwished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer\nin his last silent resting-place. Again, however, his active spirit shook off the\nlethargy which springs from despair. If there was\nnothing else left to him, he could at least devote\nhis life to revenge. With indomitable patience\nand perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a\npower of sustained vindictiveness, which he may\nhave learned from the Indians amongst whom he\nhad lived."

On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle\nCa\u02dcnon, from which they had commenced their ill-\nfated \ufb02ight. Thence he could look down upon\nthe home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he\nleaned upon his ri\ufb02e and shook his gaunt hand\n\ufb01ercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were\n\ufb02ags in some of the principal streets, and other\nsigns of festivity. He was still speculating as to\nwhat this might mean when he heard the clatter\nof horse\u2019s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding\ntowards him. As he approached, he recognized\nhim as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he\nhad rendered services at different times. He there-\nfore accosted him when he got up to him, with the\nobject of \ufb01nding out what Lucy Ferrier\u2019s fate had\nbeen. \u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remem-\nber me.\u201d\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised\nastonishment\u2014indeed, it was dif\ufb01cult to recognize\nin this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\nwhite face and \ufb01erce, wild eyes, the spruce young\nhunter of former days. Having, however, at last,\nsatis\ufb01ed himself as to his identity, the man\u2019s sur-\nprise changed to consternation. \u201cYou are mad to come here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is as\nmuch as my own life is worth to be seen talking\nwith you. There is a warrant against you from the\nHoly Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope\nsaid, earnestly. \u201cYou must know something of this\nmatter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have al-\nways been friends. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t refuse to\nanswer me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Mormon asked uneasily. \u201cBe\nquick. The very rocks have ears and the trees\neyes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier?\u201d\n\u201cShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Hope faintly. He was\nwhite to the very lips, and had sunk down on the\nstone against which he had been leaning."

They\u2019d both been\nin the party that followed them, and Stangerson\nhad shot her father, which seemed to give him the\nbest claim; but when they argued it out in council,\nDrebber\u2019s party was the stronger, so the Prophet\ngave her over to him. No one won\u2019t have her very\nlong though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you\noff, then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am off,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, who had\nrisen from his seat. His face might have been chis-\nelled out of marble, so hard and set was its expres-\nsion, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d he answered; and, slinging his\nweapon over his shoulder, strode off down the\ngorge and so away into the heart of the mountains\nto the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them\nall there was none so \ufb01erce and so dangerous as\nhimself. The prediction of the Mormon was only too\nwell ful\ufb01lled. Whether it was the terrible death\nof her father or the effects of the hateful marriage\ninto which she had been forced, poor Lucy never\nheld up her head again, but pined away and died\nwithin a month. Her sottish husband, who had\nmarried her principally for the sake of John Fer-\nrier\u2019s property, did not affect any great grief at his\nbereavement; but his other wives mourned over\nher, and sat up with her the night before the burial,\nas is the Mormon custom. They were grouped\nround the bier in the early hours of the morn-\ning, when, to their inexpressible fear and aston-\nishment, the door was \ufb02ung open, and a savage-\nlooking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments\nstrode into the room. Without a glance or a word\nto the cowering women, he walked up to the white\nsilent \ufb01gure which had once contained the pure\nsoul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed\nhis lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then,\nsnatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring\nfrom her \ufb01nger. \u201cShe shall not be buried in that,\u201d\nhe cried with a \ufb01erce snarl, and before an alarm\ncould be raised sprang down the stairs and was\ngone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that\nthe watchers might have found it hard to believe it\nthemselves or persuade other people of it, had it\nnot been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of\ngold which marked her as having been a bride had\ndisappeared. For some months Jefferson Hope lingered\namong the mountains, leading a strange wild\nlife, and nursing in his heart the \ufb01erce desire for\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told\nin the City of the weird \ufb01gure which was seen\nprowling about the suburbs, and which haunted\nthe lonely mountain gorges."

On an-\nother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a\ngreat boulder crashed down on him, and he only\nescaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon\nhis face. The two young Mormons were not long\nin discovering the reason of these attempts upon\ntheir lives, and led repeated expeditions into the\nmountains in the hope of capturing or killing their\nenemy, but always without success. Then they\nadopted the precaution of never going out alone or\nafter nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these mea-\nsures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their\nopponent, and they hoped that time had cooled\nhis vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, aug-\nmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind was of a hard, un-\nyielding nature, and the predominant idea of re-\nvenge had taken such complete possession of it\nthat there was no room for any other emotion. He\nwas, however, above all things practical. He soon\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not\nstand the incessant strain which he was putting\nupon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food\nwere wearing him out. If he died like a dog among\nthe mountains, what was to become of his revenge\nthen? And yet such a death was sure to overtake\nhim if he persisted. He felt that that was to play\nhis enemy\u2019s game, so he reluctantly returned to the\nold Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and\nto amass money enough to allow him to pursue\nhis object without privation. His intention had been to be absent a year at\nthe most, but a combination of unforeseen circum-\nstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly\n\ufb01ve. At the end of that time, however, his memory\nof his wrongs and his craving for revenge were\nquite as keen as on that memorable night when\nhe had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised,\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt\nLake City, careless what became of his own life, as\nlong as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There\nhad been a schism among the Chosen People a few\nmonths before, some of the younger members of\nthe Church having rebelled against the authority\nof the Elders, and the result had been the secession\nof a certain number of the malcontents, who had\nleft Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had\nbeen Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew\nwhither they had gone. Rumour reported that\nDrebber had managed to convert a large part of\nhis property into money, and that he had departed\na wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson,\nwas comparatively poor. There was no clue at all,\nhowever, as to their whereabouts. Many a man, however vindictive, would have\nabandoned all thought of revenge in the face of\nsuch a dif\ufb01culty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered\nfor a moment."

Year\npassed into year, his black hair turned grizzled,\nbut still he wandered on, a human bloodhound,\nwith his mind wholly set upon the one object upon\nwhich he had devoted his life. At last his per-\nseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of\na face in a window, but that one glance told him\nthat Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom\nhe was in pursuit of. He returned to his miser-\nable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all ar-\nranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, look-\ning from his window, had recognized the vagrant\nin the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He\nhurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied\nby Stangerson, who had become his private secre-\ntary, and represented to him that they were in dan-\nger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an\nold rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken\ninto custody, and not being able to \ufb01nd sureties,\nwas detained for some weeks. When at last he was\nliberated, it was only to \ufb01nd that Drebber\u2019s house\nwas deserted, and that he and his secretary had\ndeparted for Europe. Again the avenger had been foiled, and again\nhis concentrated hatred urged him to continue the\npursuit.

At last, hav-\ning collected enough to keep life in him, he de-\nparted for Europe, and tracked his enemies from\ncity to city, working his way in any menial capac-\nity, but never overtaking the fugitives.

Our prisoner made no attempt at escape,\nbut stepped calmly into the cab which had been\nhis, and we followed him.

I did so; and became at once conscious of an ex-\ntraordinary throbbing and commotion which was\ngoing on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to\nthrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside\nwhen some powerful engine was at work. In the\nsilence of the room I could hear a dull humming\nand buzzing noise which proceeded from the same\nsource. \u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou have an aortic aneurism!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they call it,\u201d he said, placidly. \u201cI\nwent to a Doctor last week about it, and he told me\nthat it is bound to burst before many days passed.

He spoke in a calm and methodical\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated\nwere commonplace enough. I can vouch for the\naccuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\naccess to Lestrade\u2019s note-book, in which the pris-\noner\u2019s words were taken down exactly as they\nwere uttered. \u201cIt don\u2019t much matter to you why I hated these\nmen,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s enough that they were guilty\nof the death of two human beings\u2014a father and a\ndaughter\u2014and that they had, therefore, forfeited\ntheir own lives. After the lapse of time that has\npassed since their crime, it was impossible for me\nto secure a conviction against them in any court.

You\u2019d have done the same, if you have\nany manhood in you, if you had been in my place. \u201cThat girl that I spoke of was to have married\nme twenty years ago.

When I\ngot to London my pocket was about empty, and I\nfound that I must turn my hand to something for\nmy living. Driving and riding are as natural to me\nas walking, so I applied at a cabowner\u2019s of\ufb01ce, and\nsoon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum\na week to the owner, and whatever was over that\nI might keep for myself. There was seldom much\nover, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The\nhardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon\nthat of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this\ncity is the most confusing. I had a map beside me\nthough, and when once I had spotted the principal\nhotels and stations, I got on pretty well. \u201cIt was some time before I found out where my\ntwo gentlemen were living; but I inquired and in-\nquired until at last I dropped across them. They\nwere at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on\nthe other side of the river. When once I found\nthem out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance\nof their recognizing me. I would dog them and\nfollow them until I saw my opportunity. I was de-\ntermined that they should not escape me again. \u201cThey were very near doing it for all that. Go\nwhere they would about London, I was always at\ntheir heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab,\nand sometimes on foot, but the former was the\nbest, for then they could not get away from me. It\nwas only early in the morning or late at night that\nI could earn anything, so that I began to get be-\nhind hand with my employer. I did not mind that,\nhowever, as long as I could lay my hand upon the\nmen I wanted. \u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must\nhave thought that there was some chance of their\nbeing followed, for they would never go out alone,\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I\ndrove behind them every day, and never once saw\nthem separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught nap-\nping. I watched them late and early, but never saw\nthe ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged,\nfor something told me that the hour had almost\ncome. My only fear was that this thing in my chest\nmight burst a little too soon and leave my work\nundone. \u201cAt last, one evening I was driving up and\ndown Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in\nwhich they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought\nout, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson fol-\nlowed it, and drove off.

Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Dreb-\nber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so\nclose to them in the bustle that I could hear every\nword that passed between them. Drebber said that\nhe had a little business of his own to do, and that\nif the other would wait for him he would soon re-\njoin him. His companion remonstrated with him,\nand reminded him that they had resolved to stick\ntogether. Drebber answered that the matter was a\ndelicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not\ncatch what Stangerson said to that, but the other\nburst out swearing, and reminded him that he was\n56\nA Study In Scarlet\nnothing more than his paid servant, and that he\nmust not presume to dictate to him.

I had my enemies within my\npower. Together they could protect each other,\nbut singly they were at my mercy. I did not\nact, however, with undue precipitation. My plans\nwere already formed.

I had my plans arranged\nby which I should have the opportunity of making\nthe man who had wronged me understand that his\nold sin had found him out. It chanced that some\ndays before a gentleman who had been engaged in\nlooking over some houses in the Brixton Road had\ndropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned;\nbut in the interval I had taken a moulding of it,\nand had a duplicate constructed. By means of this\nI had access to at least one spot in this great city\nwhere I could rely upon being free from interrup-\ntion. How to get Drebber to that house was the\ndif\ufb01cult problem which I had now to solve. \u201cHe walked down the road and went into one\nor two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-\nhour in the last of them.

If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for\n57\nA Study In Scarlet\na thing, and longed for it during twenty long years,\nand then suddenly found it within your reach, you\nwould understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and\npuffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands\nwere trembling, and my temples throbbing with\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier\nand sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness\nand smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in\nthis room. All the way they were ahead of me, one\non each side of the horse until I pulled up at the\nhouse in the Brixton Road. \u201cThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to\nbe heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I\nlooked in at the window, I found Drebber all hud-\ndled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by\nthe arm, \u2018It\u2019s time to get out,\u2019 I said. \u201c \u2018All right, cabby,\u2019 said he. \u201cI suppose he thought we had come to the ho-\ntel that he had mentioned, for he got out without\nanother word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he\nwas still a little top-heavy. When we came to the\ndoor, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and\nthe daughter were walking in front of us. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s infernally dark,\u2019 said he, stamping about. \u201c \u2018We\u2019ll soon have a light,\u2019 I said, striking a\nmatch and putting it to a wax candle which I had\nbrought with me. \u2018Now, Enoch Drebber,\u2019 I contin-\nued, turning to him, and holding the light to my\nown face, \u2018who am I?\u2019\n\u201cHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes\nfor a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up\nin them, and convulse his whole features, which\nshowed me that he knew me."

The\npulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers,\nand I believe I would have had a \ufb01t of some sort\nif the blood had not gushed from my nose and re-\nlieved me. \u201c \u2018What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?\u2019 I\ncried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his\nface. \u2018Punishment has been slow in coming, but it\nhas overtaken you at last.\u2019 I saw his coward lips\ntremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his\nlife, but he knew well that it was useless. \u201c \u2018Would you murder me?\u2019 he stammered. \u201c \u2018There is no murder,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Who talks\nof murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you\nupon my poor darling, when you dragged her\nfrom her slaughtered father, and bore her away to\nyour accursed and shameless harem.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018It was not I who killed her father,\u2019 he cried. \u201c \u2018But it was you who broke her innocent heart,\u2019\nI shrieked, thrusting the box before him. \u2018Let\nthe high God judge between us.

Then I swallowed\nthe other, and we stood facing one another in si-\nlence for a minute or more, waiting to see which\nwas to live and which was to die.

I don\u2019t know what\nit was that put it into my head to write upon the\nwall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea\nof setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt\nlight-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a Ger-\nman being found in New York with RACHE writ-\nten up above him, and it was argued at the time\nin the newspapers that the secret societies must\nhave done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New\nYorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped\nmy \ufb01nger in my own blood and printed it on a\nconvenient place on the wall. Then I walked down\nto my cab and found that there was nobody about,\nand that the night was still very wild. I had driven\nsome distance when I put my hand into the pocket\nin which I usually kept Lucy\u2019s ring, and found that\nit was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it\n58\nA Study In Scarlet\nwas the only memento that I had of her. Thinking\nthat I might have dropped it when I stooped over\nDrebber\u2019s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab\nin a side street, I went boldly up to the house\u2014for\nI was ready to dare anything rather than lose the\nring. When I arrived there, I walked right into\nthe arms of a police-of\ufb01cer who was coming out,\nand only managed to disarm his suspicions by pre-\ntending to be hopelessly drunk. \u201cThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stanger-\nson, and so pay off John Ferrier\u2019s debt. I knew that\nhe was staying at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, and I\nhung about all day, but he never came out. I fancy\nthat he suspected something when Drebber failed\nto put in an appearance. He was cunning, was\nStangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought\nhe could keep me off by staying indoors he was\nvery much mistaken. I soon found out which was\nthe window of his bedroom, and early next morn-\ning I took advantage of some ladders which were\nlying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my\nway into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke\nhim up and told him that the hour had come when\nhe was to answer for the life he had taken so long\nbefore. I described Drebber\u2019s death to him, and\nI gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which\nthat offered him, he sprang from his bed and \ufb02ew\nat my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the\nheart. It would have been the same in any case, for\nProvidence would never have allowed his guilty\nhand to pick out anything but the poison."

I went on cabbing it for a\nday or so, intending to keep at it until I could save\nenough to take me back to America. I was stand-\ning in the yard when a ragged youngster asked\nif there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope,\nand said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman\nat 221b, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no\nharm, and the next thing I knew, this young man\nhere had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly\nsnackled as ever I saw in my life.

You may consider me to\nbe a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much\nan of\ufb01cer of justice as you are.\u201d\nSo thrilling had the man\u2019s narrative been, and\nhis manner was so impressive that we had sat\nsilent and absorbed. Even the professional detec-\ntives, blase as they were in every detail of crime, ap-\npeared to be keenly interested in the man\u2019s story. When he \ufb01nished we sat for some minutes in a\nstillness which was only broken by the scratch-\ning of Lestrade\u2019s pencil as he gave the \ufb01nishing\ntouches to his shorthand account. \u201cThere is only one point on which I should like\na little more information,\u201d Sherlock Holmes said\nat last. \u201cWho was your accomplice who came for\nthe ring which I advertised?\u201d\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \u201cI\ncan tell my own secrets,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t get\nother people into trouble.

CHAPTER VII. The Conclusion\nWe had all been warned to appear before\nthe magistrates upon the Thursday; but when the\nThursday came there was no occasion for our tes-\ntimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in\nhand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned be-\nfore a tribunal where strict justice would be meted\nout to him.

Never mind,\u201d he con-\ntinued, more brightly, after a pause. \u201cI would not\nhave missed the investigation for anything. There\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instruc-\ntive points about it.\u201d\n\u201cSimple!\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cWell, really, it can hardly be described as oth-\nerwise,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my sur-\nprise. \u201cThe proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that\nwithout any help save a few very ordinary deduc-\ntions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal\nwithin three days.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said I. \u201cI have already explained to you that what is\nout of the common is usually a guide rather than\na hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the\ngrand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That\nis a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy\none, but people do not practise it much. In the\nevery-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are \ufb01fty who can reason synthetically for\none who can reason analytically.\u201d\n\u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cI hardly expected that you would. Let me see\nif I can make it clearer. Most people, if you de-\nscribe a train of events to them, will tell you what\nthe result would be. They can put those events to-\ngether in their minds, and argue from them that\nsomething will come to pass. There are few peo-\nple, however, who, if you told them a result, would\nbe able to evolve from their own inner conscious-\nness what the steps were which led up to that re-\nsult. This power is what I mean when I talk of\nreasoning backwards, or analytically.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said I. \u201cNow this was a case in which you were given\nthe result and had to \ufb01nd everything else for your-\nself. Now let me endeavour to show you the dif-\nferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the be-\nginning. I approached the house, as you know,\non foot, and with my mind entirely free from all\nimpressions. I naturally began by examining the\nroadway, and there, as I have already explained to\nyou, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I as-\ncertained by inquiry, must have been there during\nthe night. I satis\ufb01ed myself that it was a cab and\nnot a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the\nwheels. The ordinary London growler is consider-\nably less wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham."

        "text": "\u201cThis was the \ufb01rst point gained. I then walked\nslowly down the garden path, which happened\nto be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to\nyou to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to\nmy trained eyes every mark upon its surface had\na meaning. There is no branch of detective science\nwhich is so important and so much neglected as\nthe art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always\nlaid great stress upon it, and much practice has\nmade it second nature to me. I saw the heavy foot-\nmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track\nof the two men who had \ufb01rst passed through the\ngarden. It was easy to tell that they had been\nbefore the others, because in places their marks\nhad been entirely obliterated by the others com-\ning upon the top of them. In this way my second\nlink was formed, which told me that the noctur-\nnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable\nfor his height (as I calculated from the length of\nhis stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to\njudge from the small and elegant impression left\nby his boots. \u201cOn entering the house this last inference was\ncon\ufb01rmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder\nthere was. There was no wound upon the dead\nman\u2019s person, but the agitated expression upon his\nface assured me that he had foreseen his fate be-\nfore it came upon him. Men who die from heart\ndisease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any\nchance exhibit agitation upon their features. Hav-\ning sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a slightly\nsour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he\nhad had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued\nthat it had been forced upon him from the hatred\nand fear expressed upon his face. By the method of\nexclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other\nhypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine\nthat it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible ad-\nministration of poison is by no means a new thing\n60\nA Study In Scarlet\nin criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa,\nand of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once\nto any toxicologist. \u201cAnd now came the great question as to the\nreason why. Robbery had not been the object of\nthe murder, for nothing was taken. Was it poli-\ntics, then, or was it a woman? That was the ques-\ntion which confronted me. I was inclined from the\n\ufb01rst to the latter supposition. Political assassins\nare only too glad to do their work and to \ufb02y. This\nmurder had, on the contrary, been done most de-\nliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all\nover the room, showing that he had been there all\nthe time. It must have been a private wrong, and\nnot a political one, which called for such a method-\nical revenge."

        "text": "When the inscription was discovered\nupon the wall I was more inclined than ever to\nmy opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the\nquestion. Clearly the murderer had used it to re-\nmind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether\nhe had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as\nto any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former ca-\nreer. He answered, you remember, in the negative. \u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examina-\ntion of the room, which con\ufb01rmed me in my opin-\nion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished me\nwith the additional details as to the Trichinopoly\ncigar and the length of his nails. I had already\ncome to the conclusion, since there were no signs\nof a struggle, that the blood which covered the\n\ufb02oor had burst from the murderer\u2019s nose in his ex-\ncitement. I could perceive that the track of blood\ncoincided with the track of his feet. It is sel-\ndom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded,\nbreaks out in this way through emotion, so I haz-\narded the opinion that the criminal was probably\na robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that\nI had judged correctly. \u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what\nGregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head\nof the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to\nthe circumstances connected with the marriage of\nEnoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It\ntold me that Drebber had already applied for the\nprotection of the law against an old rival in love,\nnamed Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope\nwas at present in Europe. I knew now that I held\nthe clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that\nremained was to secure the murderer. \u201cI had already determined in my own mind\nthat the man who had walked into the house with\nDrebber, was none other than the man who had\ndriven the cab. The marks in the road showed me\nthat the horse had wandered on in a way which\nwould have been impossible had there been any-\none in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver\nbe, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is\nabsurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it\nwere, of a third person, who was sure to betray\nhim. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog\nanother through London, what better means could\nhe adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these consid-\nerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that\nJefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys\nof the Metropolis. \u201cIf he had been one there was no reason to be-\nlieve that he had ceased to be. On the contrary,\nfrom his point of view, any sudden chance would\nbe likely to draw attention to himself. He would,\nprobably, for a time at least, continue to perform\nhis duties."

With his long, white, nervous \ufb01n-\ngers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled\nback his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his\neyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm\nand wrist all dotted and scarred with innumer-\nable puncture-marks.

Would you care to try it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d I answered, brusquely. \u201cMy con-\nstitution has not got over the Afghan campaign\nyet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon\nit.\u201d\nHe smiled at my vehemence. \u201cPerhaps you are\nright, Watson,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose that its in\ufb02u-\nence is physically a bad one. I \ufb01nd it, however,\nso transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the\nmind that its secondary action is a matter of small\nmoment.\u201d\n\u201cBut consider!\u201d I said, earnestly. \u201cCount the\ncost! Your brain may, as you say, be roused and ex-\ncited, but it is a pathological and morbid process,\nwhich involves increased tissue-change and may at\nlast leave a permanent weakness."

Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science,\nand should be treated in the same cold and un-\nemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it\nwith romanticism, which produces much the same\neffect as if you worked a love-story or an elope-\nment into the \ufb01fth proposition of Euclid.\u201d\n\u201cBut the romance was there,\u201d I remonstrated. \u201cI could not tamper with the facts.\u201d\n67\nThe Sign of the Four\n\u201cSome facts should be suppressed, or at least\na just sense of proportion should be observed in\ntreating them. The only point in the case which\ndeserved mention was the curious analytical rea-\nsoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded\nin unraveling it.\u201d\nI was annoyed at this criticism of a work which\nhad been specially designed to please him.

I made no remark, however, but sat\nnursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet\nthrough it some time before, and, though it did\nnot prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at\nevery change of the weather. \u201cMy practice has extended recently to the Con-\ntinent,\u201d said Holmes, after a while, \ufb01lling up his\nold brier-root pipe. \u201cI was consulted last week by\nFrancois Le Villard, who, as you probably know,\nhas come rather to the front lately in the French de-\ntective service. He has all the Celtic power of quick\nintuition, but he is de\ufb01cient in the wide range of\nexact knowledge which is essential to the higher\ndevelopments of his art. The case was concerned\nwith a will, and possessed some features of inter-\nest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,\nthe one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis\nin 1871, which have suggested to him the true so-\nlution. Here is the letter which I had this morning\nacknowledging my assistance.\u201d He tossed over, as\nhe spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I\nglanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of\nnotes of admiration, with stray magni\ufb01ques, coup-\nde-ma\u02c6\u0131tres and tours-de-force, all testifying to the ar-\ndent admiration of the Frenchman. \u201cHe speaks as a pupil to his master,\u201d said I. \u201cOh, he rates my assistance too highly,\u201d said\nSherlock Holmes, lightly. \u201cHe has considerable\ngifts himself. He possesses two out of the three\nqualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has\nthe power of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge; and that may\ncome in time. He is now translating my small\nworks into French.\u201d\n\u201cYour works?\u201d\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d he cried, laughing. \u201cYes, I have been guilty of several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for\nexample, is one \u2018Upon the Distinction between the\nAshes of the Various Tobaccoes.\u2019 In it I enumerate a\nhundred and forty forms of cigar-, cigarette-, and\npipe-tobacco, with colored plates illustrating the\ndifference in the ash. It is a point which is con-\ntinually turning up in criminal trials, and which\nis sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If\nyou can say de\ufb01nitely, for example, that some mur-\nder has been done by a man who was smoking an\nIndian lunkah, it obviously narrows your \ufb01eld of\nsearch. To the trained eye there is as much differ-\nence between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and\nthe white \ufb02uff of bird\u2019s-eye as there is between a\ncabbage and a potato.\u201d\n\u201cYou have an extraordinary genius for minu-\ntiae,\u201d I remarked. \u201cI appreciate their importance.

That is a mat-\nter of great practical interest to the scienti\ufb01c detec-\ntive,\u2014especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or\nin discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I\nweary you with my hobby.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d I answered, earnestly. \u201cIt is of the\ngreatest interest to me, especially since I have had\nthe opportunity of observing your practical appli-\ncation of it.

Observation tells me that you have a little reddish\nmould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the\nSeymour Street Of\ufb01ce they have taken up the pave-\nment and thrown up some earth which lies in such\na way that it is dif\ufb01cult to avoid treading in it in\nentering.

I see also in your open desk there that you have a\nsheet of stamps and a thick bundle of postcards. What could you go into the post-of\ufb01ce for, then,\nbut to send a wire? Eliminate all other factors, and\nthe one which remains must be the truth.\u201d\n\u201cIn this case it certainly is so,\u201d I replied, after a\nlittle thought. \u201cThe thing, however, is, as you say,\nof the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if\nI were to put your theories to a more severe test?\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he answered, \u201cit would pre-\nvent me from taking a second dose of cocaine.

Would you have the kindness to let\nme have an opinion upon the character or habits of\nthe late owner?\u201d\nI handed him over the watch with some slight\nfeeling of amusement in my heart, for the test\nwas, as I thought, an impossible one, and I in-\ntended it as a lesson against the somewhat dog-\nmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He\nbalanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the\ndial, opened the back, and examined the works,\n\ufb01rst with his naked eyes and then with a power-\nful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling\nat his crestfallen face when he \ufb01nally snapped the\ncase to and handed it back. \u201cThere are hardly any data,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThe watch has been recently cleaned, which robs\nme of my most suggestive facts.\u201d\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt was cleaned be-\nfore being sent to me.\u201d In my heart I accused my\ncompanion of putting forward a most lame and\nimpotent excuse to cover his failure. What data\ncould he expect from an uncleaned watch? \u201cThough unsatisfactory, my research has not\nbeen entirely barren,\u201d he observed, staring up at\nthe ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. \u201cSubject\nto your correction, I should judge that the watch\nbelonged to your elder brother, who inherited it\nfrom your father.\u201d\n\u201cThat you gather, no doubt, from the H. W.\nupon the back?\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly \ufb01fty years back,\nand the initials are as old as the watch: so it was\nmade for the last generation. Jewelry usually de-\nscents to the eldest son, and he is most likely to\nhave the same name as the father. Your father\nhas, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest\nbrother.\u201d\n\u201cRight, so far,\u201d said I. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\u201cHe was a man of untidy habits,\u2014very untidy\nand careless. He was left with good prospects, but\nhe threw away his chances, lived for some time in\npoverty with occasional short intervals of prosper-\nity, and \ufb01nally, taking to drink, he died. That is all\nI can gather.\u201d\nI sprang from my chair and limped impatiently\nabout the room with considerable bitterness in my\nheart. \u201cThis is unworthy of you, Holmes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\ncould not have believed that you would have de-\nscended to this. You have made inquires into the\nhistory of my unhappy brother, and you now pre-\ntend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful\nway. You cannot expect me to believe that you have\nread all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and,\nto speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear doctor,\u201d said he, kindly, \u201cpray accept\nmy apologies.

I did not at all ex-\npect to be so accurate.\u201c\n\u201cBut it was not mere guess-work?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no:\nI never guess. It is a shocking\nhabit,\u2014destructive to the logical faculty.

Neither is it a very far-fetched inference\n69\nThe Sign of the Four\nthat a man who inherits one article of such value\nis pretty well provided for in other respects.\u201d\nI nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning. \u201cIt is very customary for pawnbrokers in Eng-\nland, when they take a watch, to scratch the num-\nber of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside\nof the case. It is more handy than a label, as there\nis no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to\nmy lens on the inside of this case. Inference,\u2014that\nyour brother was often at low water. Secondary\ninference,\u2014that he had occasional bursts of pros-\nperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which\ncontains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of\nscratches all round the hole,\u2014marks where the key\nhas slipped. What sober man\u2019s key could have\nscored those grooves? But you will never see a\ndrunkard\u2019s watch without them. He winds it at\nnight, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady\nhand. Where is the mystery in all this?\u201d\n\u201cIt is as clear as daylight,\u201d I answered. \u201cI re-\ngret the injustice which I did you. I should have\nhad more faith in your marvellous faculty. May I\nask whether you have any professional inquiry on\nfoot at present?\u201d\n\u201cNone. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live with-\nout brain-work. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary,\ndismal, unpro\ufb01table world? See how the yellow\nfog swirls down the street and drifts across the\nduncolored houses.

The Statement of the Case\nMiss Morstan entered the room with a \ufb01rm\nstep and an outward composure of manner. She\nwas a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well\ngloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and simplicity\nabout her costume which bore with it a sugges-\ntion of limited means. The dress was a sombre\ngrayish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she\nwore a small turban of the same dull hue, re-\nlieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the\nside.

In the year 1878\nmy father, who was senior captain of his regiment,\nobtained twelve months\u2019 leave and came home. He\ntelegraphed to me from London that he had ar-\nrived all safe, and directed me to come down at\nonce, giving the Langham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full of kindness\nand love. On reaching London I drove to the Lang-\nham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was\nstaying there, but that he had gone out the night\nbefore and had not yet returned. I waited all day\nwithout news of him. That night, on the advice\nof the manager of the hotel, I communicated with\nthe police, and next morning we advertised in all\nthe papers.

By her advice I published my ad-\ndress in the advertisement column. The same day\nthere arrived through the post a small card-board\nbox addressed to me, which I found to contain a\nvery large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing\nwas enclosed. Since then every year upon the same\ndate there has always appeared a similar box, con-\ntaining a similar pearl, without any clue as to the\nsender. They have been pronounced by an expert\nto be of a rare variety and of considerable value.

We shall look\nout for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the\npapers. I may look into the matter before then. It\nis only half-past three.

Let me recommend this book,\u2014one of\nthe most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood\nReade\u2019s Martyrdom of Man. I shall be back in an\nhour.\u201d\nI sat in the window with the volume in my\nhand, but my thoughts were far from the daring\nspeculations of the writer. My mind ran upon\nour late visitor,\u2014her smiles, the deep rich tones\nof her voice, the strange mystery which overhung\nher life. If she were seventeen at the time of\nher father\u2019s disappearance she must be seven-and-\ntwenty now,\u2014a sweet age, when youth has lost its\nself-consciousness and become a little sobered by\nexperience. So I sat and mused, until such dan-\ngerous thoughts came into my head that I hur-\nried away to my desk and plunged furiously into\nthe latest treatise upon pathology. What was I,\nan army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker\nbanking-account, that I should dare to think of\nsuch things? She was a unit, a factor,\u2014nothing\nmore. If my future were black, it was better surely\nto face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it\nby mere will-o\u2019-the-wisps of the imagination. 72\nThe Sign of the Four\nCHAPTER III.

The details are still to be\nadded. I have just found, on consulting the back\n\ufb01les of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Nor-\nword, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon\nthe 28th of April, 1882.\u201d\n\u201cI may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see\nwhat this suggests.\u201d\n\u201cNo? You surprise me. Look at it in this way,\nthen. Captain Morstan disappears. The only per-\nson in London whom he could have visited is Ma-\njor Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that\nhe was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. Within a week of his death Captain Morstan\u2019s daugh-\nter receives a valuable present, which is repeated\nfrom year to year, and now culminates in a letter\nwhich describes her as a wronged woman. What\nwrong can it refer to except this deprivation of\nher father? And why should the presents begin\nimmediately after Sholto\u2019s death, unless it is that\nSholto\u2019s heir knows something of the mystery and\ndesires to make compensation? Have you any al-\nternative theory which will meet the facts?\u201d\n\u201cBut what a strange compensation! And how\nstrangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter\nnow, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter\nspeaks of giving her justice. What justice can she\nhave? It is too much to suppose that her father is\nstill alive. There is no other injustice in her case\nthat you know of.\u201d\n\u201cThere are dif\ufb01culties; there are certainly dif-\n\ufb01culties,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. \u201cBut\nour expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah,\nhere is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down,\nfor it is a little past the hour.\u201d\nI picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but\nI observed that Holmes took his revolver from his\ndrawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear\nthat he thought that our night\u2019s work might be a\nserious one. Miss Morstan was muf\ufb02ed in a dark cloak,\nand her sensitive face was composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she\ndid not feel some uneasiness at the strange enter-\nprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-\ncontrol was perfect, and she readily answered the\nfew additional questions which Sherlock Holmes\nput to her. \u201cMajor Sholto was a very particular friend of\npapa\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cHis letters were full of allu-\nsions to the major. He and papa were in command\nof the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were\nthrown a great deal together. By the way, a curi-\nous paper was found in papa\u2019s desk which no one\ncould understand. I don\u2019t suppose that it is of the\nslightest importance, but I thought you might care\nto see it, so I brought it with me."

Miss Morstan\nand I chatted in an undertone about our present\nexpedition and its possible outcome, but our com-\npanion maintained his impenetrable reserve until\nthe end of our journey. 73\nThe Sign of the Four\nIt was a September evening, and not yet seven\no\u2019clock, but the day had been a dreary one,\nand a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great\ncity. Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the\nmuddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were\nbut misty splotches of diffused light which threw a\nfeeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed\nout into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a\nmurky, shifting radiance across the crowded thor-\noughfare. There was, to my mind, something\neerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of\nfaces which \ufb02itted across these narrow bars of\nlight,\u2014sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they \ufb02itted from the gloom\ninto the light, and so back into the gloom once\nmore. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull,\nheavy evening, with the strange business upon\nwhich we were engaged, combined to make me\nnervous and depressed. I could see from Miss\nMorstan\u2019s manner that she was suffering from the\nsame feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to\npetty in\ufb02uences. He held his open note-book upon\nhis knee, and from time to time he jotted down\n\ufb01gures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-\nlantern.

I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by\nreminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan;\nbut, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our\nsituation and so curious as to our destination that\nmy stories were slightly involved. To this day she\ndeclares that I told her one moving anecdote as to\nhow a musket looked into my tent at the dead of\nnight, and how I \ufb01red a double-barrelled tiger cub\nat it.

A blaze of yellow light streamed out\nupon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood\na small man with a very high head, a bristle of\nred hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald,\nshining scalp which shot out from among it like\na mountain-peak from \ufb01r-trees. He writhed his\nhands together as he stood, and his features were\nin a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling,\nbut never for an instant in repose. Nature had\ngiven him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line\nof yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove fee-\nbly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over\nthe lower part of his face. In spite of his obtru-\nsive baldness, he gave the impression of youth.

The richest\nand glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the\nwalls, looped back here and there to expose some\nrichly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The car-\npet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick\nthat the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed\nof moss.

We read the details in the papers, and, knowing\nthat he had been a friend of our father\u2019s, we dis-\ncussed the case freely in his presence. He used\nto join in our speculations as to what could have\nhappened. Never for an instant did we suspect\nthat he had the whole secret hidden in his own\nbreast,\u2014that of all men he alone knew the fate of\nArthur Morstan. \u201cWe did know,\nhowever,\nthat some mys-\ntery\u2014some positive danger\u2014overhung our father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he al-\nways employed two prize-\ufb01ghters to act as porters\nat Pondicherry Lodge. Williams, who drove you\nto-night, was one of them. He was once light-\nweight champion of England. Our father would\nnever tell us what it was he feared, but he had a\nmost marked aversion to men with wooden legs. On one occasion he actually \ufb01red his revolver at a\nwooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless\ntradesman canvassing for orders. We had to pay a\nlarge sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I\nused to think this a mere whim of my father\u2019s, but\nevents have since led us to change our opinion. \u201cEarly in 1882 my father received a letter from\nIndia which was a great shock to him. He nearly\nfainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it,\nand from that day he sickened to his death. What\nwas in the letter we could never discover, but I\ncould see as he held it that it was short and writ-\nten in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for\nyears from an enlarged spleen, but he now became\nrapidly worse, and towards the end of April we\nwere informed that he was beyond all hope, and\nthat he wished to make a last communication to\nus. \u201cWhen we entered his room he was propped\nup with pillows and breathing heavily. He be-\nsought us to lock the door and to come upon ei-\nther side of the bed. Then, grasping our hands,\nhe made a remarkable statement to us, in a voice\nwhich was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shall try and give it to you in his own very words. \u201c \u2018I have only one thing,\u2019 he said, \u2018which weighs\nupon my mind at this supreme moment. It is my\ntreatment of poor Morstan\u2019s orphan. The cursed\ngreed which has been my besetting sin through life\nhas withheld from her the treasure, half at least of\nwhich should have been hers. And yet I have made\nno use of it myself,\u2014so blind and foolish a thing\nis avarice. The mere feeling of possession has been\nso dear to me that I could not bear to share it with\nanother. See that chaplet dipped with pearls be-\nside the quinine-bottle.

When I stooped over him I\nfound, to my horror, that he was dead. \u201c \u2018For a long time I sat half distracted, wonder-\ning what I should do. My \ufb01rst impulse was, of\ncourse, to call for assistance; but I could not but\nrecognize that there was every chance that I would\nbe accused of his murder. His death at the moment\nof a quarrel, and the gash in his head, would be\nblack against me. Again, an of\ufb01cial inquiry could\nnot be made without bringing out some facts about\nthe treasure, which I was particularly anxious to\nkeep secret. He had told me that no soul upon\nearth knew where he had gone. There seemed to\nbe no necessity why any soul ever should know. \u201c \u2018I was still pondering over the matter, when,\nlooking up, I saw my servant, Lal Chowdar, in the\ndoorway. He stole in and bolted the door behind\nhim. \u201cDo not fear, Sahib,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one need\nknow that you have killed him. Let us hide him\naway, and who is the wiser?\u201d \u201cI did not kill him,\u201d\nsaid I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. \u201cI\nheard it all, Sahib,\u201d said he. \u201cI heard you quar-\nrel, and I heard the blow. But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him away\ntogether.\u201d That was enough to decide met. If my\nown servant could not believe my innocence, how\ncould I hope to make it good before twelve fool-\nish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and I\ndisposed of the body that night, and within a few\ndays the London papers were full of the mysteri-\nous disappearance of Captain Morstan. You will\nsee from what I say that I can hardly be blamed\nin the matter. My fault lies in the fact that we con-\ncealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and\nthat I have clung to Morstan\u2019s share as well as to\nmy own."

The treasure is\nhidden in\u2014At this instant a horrible change came\nover his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw\ndropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can\nnever forget, \u2018Keep him out! For Christ\u2019s sake keep\nhim out\u2019! We both stared round at the window be-\nhind us upon which his gaze was \ufb01xed. A face\nwas looking in at us out of the darkness. We could\nsee the whitening of the nose where it was pressed\nagainst the glass. It was a bearded, hairy face, with\nwild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated\nmalevolence. My brother and I rushed towards\nthe window, but the man was gone. When we re-\nturned to my father his head had dropped and his\npulse had ceased to beat. \u201cWe searched the garden that night, but found\nno sign of the intruder, save that just under the\nwindow a single footmark was visible in the\n\ufb02ower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have\nthought that our imaginations had conjured up\nthat wild, \ufb01erce face. We soon, however, had an-\nother and a more striking proof that there were\nsecret agencies at work all round us. The window\nof my father\u2019s room was found open in the morn-\ning, his cupboards and boxes had been ri\ufb02ed, and\nupon his chest was \ufb01xed a torn piece of paper, with\nthe words \u2018The sign of the four\u2019 scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor\nmay have been, we never knew. As far as we can\njudge, none of my father\u2019s property had been ac-\ntually stolen, though everything had been turned\nout. My brother and I naturally associated this\npeculiar incident with the fear which haunted my\nfather during his life; but it is still a complete mys-\ntery to us.\u201d\nThe little man stopped to relight his hookah\nand puffed thoughtfully for a few moments. We\nhad all sat absorbed, listening to his extraordi-\nnary narrative. At the short account of her father\u2019s\ndeath Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and\nfor a moment I feared that she was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass of water\nwhich I quietly poured out for her from a Vene-\ntian carafe upon the side-table. Sherlock Holmes\nleaned back in his chair with an abstracted ex-\npression and the lids drawn low over his glittering\neyes. As I glanced at him I could not but think\nhow on that very day he had complained bitterly\nof the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was\na problem which would tax his sagacity to the ut-\nmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to\n77\nThe Sign of the Four\nthe other of us with an obvious pride at the effect\nwhich his story had produced, and then continued\nbetween the puffs of his overgrown pipe. \u201cMy brother and I,\u201d said he, \u201cwere, as you may\nimagine, much excited as to the treasure which my\nfather had spoken of."

Over this chaplet\nmy brother Bartholomew and I had some little dis-\ncussion. The pearls were evidently of great value,\nand he was averse to part with them, for, between\nfriends, my brother was himself a little inclined\nto my father\u2019s fault. He thought, too, that if we\nparted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip\nand \ufb01nally bring us into trouble. It was all that I\ncould do to persuade him to let me \ufb01nd out Miss\nMorstan\u2019s address and send her a detached pearl\nat \ufb01xed intervals, so that at least she might never\nfeel destitute.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a kindly thought,\u201d said our companion,\nearnestly. \u201cIt was extremely good of you.\u201d\nThe little man waved his hand deprecatingly. \u201cWe were your trustees,\u201c he said. \u201dThat was\nthe view which I took of it, though Brother\nBartholomew could not altogether see it in that\nlight.

Our difference of opinion on this subject\nwent so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for\nmyself: so I left Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old\nkhitmutgar and Williams with me. Yesterday, how-\never, I learn that an event of extreme importance\nhas occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I\ninstantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it\nonly remains for us to drive out to Norwood and\ndemand our share. I explained my views last night\nto Brother Bartholomew: so we shall be expected,\nif not welcome, visitors.\u201d\nMr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching\non his luxurious settee. We all remained silent,\nwith our thoughts upon the new development\nwhich the mysterious business had taken. Holmes\nwas the \ufb01rst to spring to his feet. \u201cYou have done well, sir, from \ufb01rst to last,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cIt is possible that we may be able to\nmake you some small return by throwing some\nlight upon that which is still dark to you. But, as\nMiss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we\nhad best put the matter through without delay.\u201d\nOur new acquaintance very deliberately coiled\nup the tube of his hookah, and produced from\nbehind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat\nwith Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned\ntightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of\nthe night, and \ufb01nished his attire by putting on a\nrabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which cov-\nered the ears, so that no part of him was visible\nsave his mobile and peaky face."

Thaddeus\nSholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose\nhigh above the rattle of the wheels. \u201cBartholomew is a clever fellow,\u201d said he. \u201cHow do you think he found out where the trea-\nsure was? He had come to the conclusion that\nit was somewhere indoors: so he worked out all\nthe cubic space of the house, and made measure-\nments everywhere, so that not one inch should be\nunaccounted for. Among other things, he found\nthat the height of the building was seventy-four\nfeet, but on adding together the heights of all the\nseparate rooms, and making every allowance for\nthe space between, which he ascertained by bor-\nings, he could not bring the total to more than\nseventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted\nfor. These could only be at the top of the build-\ning. He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath-and-\nplaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure\nenough, he came upon another little garret above\nit, which had been sealed up and was known to\nno one. In the centre stood the treasure-chest, rest-\ning upon two rafters. He lowered it through the\nhole, and there it lies. He computes the value of\nthe jewels at not less than half a million sterling.\u201d\nAt the mention of this gigantic sum we all\nstared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan,\ncould we secure her rights, would change from a\nneedy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice\nat such news; yet I am ashamed to say that self-\nishness took me by the soul, and that my heart\nturned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered\nout some few halting words of congratulation,\nand then sat downcast, with my head drooped,\ndeaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He\nwas clearly a con\ufb01rmed hypochondriac, and I was\n78\nThe Sign of the Four\ndreamily conscious that he was pouring forth in-\nterminable trains of symptoms, and imploring in-\nformation as to the composition and action of in-\nnumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore\nabout in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that\nhe may not remember any of the answers which I\ngave him that night. Holmes declares that he over-\nheard me caution him against the great danger of\ntaking more than two drops of castor oil, while I\nrecommended strychnine in large doses as a seda-\ntive. However that may be, I was certainly relieved\nwhen our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coach-\nman sprang down to open the door. \u201cThis, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out."

We had\nleft the damp fog of the great city behind us, and\nthe night was fairly \ufb01ne. A warm wind blew from\nthe westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly\nacross the sky, with half a moon peeping occasion-\nally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see\nfor some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down\none of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us\na better light upon our way. Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds,\nand was girt round with a very high stone wall\ntopped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-\nclamped door formed the only means of en-\ntrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar\npostman-like rat-tat. \u201cWho is there?\u201d cried a gruff voice from within. \u201cIt is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock\nby this time.\u201d\nThere was a grumbling sound and a clanking\nand jarring of keys. The door swung heavily back,\nand a short, deep-chested man stood in the open-\ning, with the yellow light of the lantern shining\nupon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful\neyes. \u201cThat you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the oth-\ners? I had no orders about them from the master.\u201d\n\u201cNo, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my\nbrother last night that I should bring some friends. \u201cHe ain\u2019t been out o\u2019 his room to-day, Mr.\nThaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very\nwell that I must stick to regulations. I can let you\nin, but your friends must just stop where they are.\u201d\nThis was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus\nSholto looked about him in a perplexed and help-\nless manner. \u201cThis is too bad of you, McMurdo!\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIf I guarantee them, that is enough for\nyou. There is the young lady, too. She cannot wait\non the public road at this hour.\u201d\n\u201cVery sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\u201d said the porter, in-\nexorably. \u201cFolk may be friends o\u2019 yours, and yet\nno friends o\u2019 the master\u2019s. He pays me well to do\nmy duty, and my duty I\u2019ll do. I don\u2019t know none\no\u2019 your friends.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes you do, McMurdo,\u201d cried Sherlock\nHolmes, genially. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have for-\ngotten me. Don\u2019t you remember the amateur who\nfought three rounds with you at Alison\u2019s rooms on\nthe night of your bene\ufb01t four years back?\u201d\n\u201cNot Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\u201d roared the prize-\n\ufb01ghter. \u201cGod\u2019s truth! how could I have mistook\nyou? If instead o\u2019 standin\u2019 there so quiet you had\njust stepped up and given me that cross-hit of\nyours under the jaw, I\u2019d ha\u2019 known you without\na question. Ah, you\u2019re one that has wasted your\ngifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you\nhad joined the fancy.\u201d\n\u201cYou see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still\none of the scienti\ufb01c professions open to me,\u201c said\nHolmes, laughing."

The vast size of the building,\nwith its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill\nto the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at\nease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his\nhand. \u201cI cannot understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must\nbe some mistake.

Wait here. I shall be\nback in a moment.\u201d He hurried for the door, and\nknocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall\nold woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at\nthe very sight of him. \u201cOh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have\ncome! I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus,\nsir!\u201d We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the\ndoor was closed and her voice died away into a\nmuf\ufb02ed monotone. Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes\nswung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the\nhouse, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cum-\nbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood to-\ngether, and her hand was in mine. A wondrous\nsubtle thing is love, for here were we two who\nhad never seen each other before that day, between\nwhom no word or even look of affection had ever\npassed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our\nhands instinctively sought for each other."

I have seen something of\nthe sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat, where\nthe prospectors had been at work.\u201d\n\u201cAnd from the same cause,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThese are the traces of the treasure-seekers.

So shaken was he that I had to pass\nmy hand under his arm as we went up the stairs,\nfor his knees were trembling under him.

The third \ufb02ight of stairs ended in a straight pas-\nsage of some length, with a great picture in Indian\ntapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon\nthe left. Holmes advanced along it in the same\nslow and methodical way, while we kept close at\nhis heels, with our long black shadows stream-\ning backwards down the corridor. The third door\nwas that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked\nwithout receiving any answer, and then tried to\nturn the handle and force it open. It was locked\non the inside, however, and by a broad and pow-\nerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp\nup against it. The key being turned, however, the\nhole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent\ndown to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp\nintaking of the breath. \u201cThere is something devilish in this, Watson,\u201d\nsaid he, more moved than I had ever before seen\nhim. \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d\nI stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was\nbright with a vague and shifty radiance. Look-\ning straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in\nthe air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung\na face,\u2014the very face of our companion Thad-\ndeus. There was the same high, shining head, the\nsame circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless\ncountenance. The features were set, however, in a\nhorrible smile, a \ufb01xed and unnatural grin, which\nin that still and moonlit room was more jarring\nto the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like\nwas the face to that of our little friend that I looked\nround at him to make sure that he was indeed with\nus. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned\nto us that his brother and he were twins. \u201cThis is terrible!\u201d I said to Holmes. \u201cWhat is to\nbe done?\u201d\n\u201cThe door must come down,\u201d he answered,\nand, springing against it, he put all his weight\nupon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not\nyield. Together we \ufb02ung ourselves upon it once\nmore, and this time it gave way with a sudden\nsnap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew\nSholto\u2019s chamber. It appeared to have been \ufb01tted up as a chemical\nlaboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bot-\ntles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door,\nand the table was littered over with Bunsen burn-\ners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood\ncarboys of acid in wicker baskets. One of these ap-\npeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream\nof dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and\nthe air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-\nlike odor. A set of steps stood at one side of the\nroom, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster,\nand above them there was an opening in the ceil-\ning large enough for a man to pass through."

He was\nstiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many\nhours. It seemed to me that not only his features\nbut all his limbs were twisted and turned in the\nmost fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table\nthere lay a peculiar instrument,\u2014a brown, close-\ngrained stick, with a stone head like a hammer,\nrudely lashed on with coarse twine.

CHAPTER VI. Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration\n\u201cNow, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his\nhands, \u201cwe have half an hour to ourselves. Let\nus make good use of it. My case is, as I have told\nyou, almost complete; but we must not err on the\nside of over-con\ufb01dence. Simple as the case seems\nnow, there may be something deeper underlying\nit.\u201d\n\u201cSimple!\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cSurely,\u201d said he, with something of the air of\na clinical professor expounding to his class. \u201cJust\nsit in the corner there, that your footprints may\nnot complicate matters. Now to work! In the \ufb01rst\nplace, how did these folk come, and how did they\ngo? The door has not been opened since last night. How of the window?\u201d He carried the lamp across\nto it, muttering his observations aloud the while,\nbut addressing them to himself rather than to me. \u201cWindow is snibbed on the inner side. Framework\nis solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No\nwater-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a\nman has mounted by the window. It rained a lit-\ntle last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould\nupon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark,\nand here again upon the \ufb02oor, and here again by\nthe table. See here, Watson! This is really a very\npretty demonstration.\u201d\nI looked at the round, well-de\ufb01ned muddy\ndiscs. \u201cThis is not a footmark,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is something much more valuable to us. It\nis the impression of a wooden stump. You see here\non the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with the\nbroad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the\ntimber-toe.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the wooden-legged man.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. But there has been some one else,\u2014a\nvery able and ef\ufb01cient ally. Could you scale that\nwall, doctor?\u201d\nI looked out of the open window. The moon\nstill shone brightly on that angle of the house. We\nwere a good sixty feet from the round, and, look\nwhere I would, I could see no foothold, nor as\nmuch as a crevice in the brick-work. \u201cIt is absolutely impossible,\u201d I answered. \u201cWithout aid it is so. But suppose you had a\nfriend up here who lowered you this good stout\n82\nThe Sign of the Four\nrope which I see in the corner, securing one end\nof it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think,\nif you were an active man, you might swarm up,\nwooden leg and all. You would depart, of course,\nin the same fashion, and your ally would draw up\nthe rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window,\nsnib it on the inside, and get away in the way that\nhe originally came."

His hands were far from\nhorny. My lens discloses more than one blood-\nmark, especially towards the end of the rope, from\nwhich I gather that he slipped down with such ve-\nlocity that he took the skin off his hand.\u201d\n\u201cThis is all very well,\u201d said I, \u201cbut the thing be-\ncomes more unintelligible than ever. How about\nthis mysterious ally? How came he into the\nroom?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the ally!\u201d repeated Holmes, pensively. \u201cThere are features of interest about this ally. He\nlifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the\nannals of crime in this country,\u2014though parallel\ncases suggest themselves from India, and, if my\nmemory serves me, from Senegambia.\u201d\n\u201cHow came he, then?\u201d I reiterated. \u201cThe door\nis locked, the window is inaccessible. Was it\nthrough the chimney?\u201d\n\u201cThe grate is much too small,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\nhad already considered that possibility.\u201d\n\u201cHow then?\u201d I persisted. \u201cYou will not apply my precept,\u201d he said, shak-\ning his head. \u201cHow often have I said to you\nthat when you have eliminated the impossible\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the\ntruth? We know that he did not come through the\ndoor, the window, or the chimney. We also know\nthat he could not have been concealed in the room,\nas there is no concealment possible. Whence, then,\ndid he come?\u201d\n\u201cHe came through the hole in the roof,\u201d I cried. \u201cOf course he did. He must have done so. If\nyou will have the kindness to hold the lamp for\nme, we shall now extend our researches to the\nroom above,\u2014the secret room in which the trea-\nsure was found.\u201d\nHe mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter\nwith either hand, he swung himself up into the\ngarret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down\nfor the lamp and held it while I followed him. The chamber in which we found ourselves was\nabout ten feet one way and six the other. The\n\ufb02oor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-\nplaster between, so that in walking one had to step\nfrom beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex,\nand was evidently the inner shell of the true roof\nof the house. There was no furniture of any sort,\nand the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon\nthe \ufb02oor. \u201cHere you are, you see,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes,\nputting his hand against the sloping wall. \u201cThis is\na trap-door which leads out on to the roof. I can\npress it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping\nat a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which\nNumber One entered. Let us see if we can \ufb01nd one\nother traces of his individuality.\u201d\nHe held down the lamp to the \ufb02oor, and as he\ndid so I saw for the second time that night a star-\ntled, surprised look come over his face."

He was closely followed by an inspector\nin uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus\nSholto. \u201cHere\u2019s a business!\u201d he cried, in a muf\ufb02ed,\nhusky voice. \u201cHere\u2019s a pretty business!

The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of\ncourse, here is a hole in the roof.\u201d With great ac-\ntivity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps\nand squeezed through into the garret, and imme-\ndiately afterwards we heard his exulting voice pro-\nclaiming that he had found the trap-door. \u201cHe can \ufb01nd something,\u201d remarked Holmes,\nshrugging his shoulders. \u201cHe has occasional glim-\nmerings of reason.

The Episode of the Barrel\nThe police had brought a cab with them, and\nin this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne\ntrouble with a calm face as long as there was\nsome one weaker than herself to support, and I\nhad found her bright and placid by the side of\nthe frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however,\nshe \ufb01rst turned faint, and then burst into a pas-\nsion of weeping,\u2014so sorely had she been tried by\nthe adventures of the night. She has told me since\nthat she thought me cold and distant upon that\njourney. She little guessed the struggle within my\nbreast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me\nback. My sympathies and my love went out to\nher, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt\nthat years of the conventionalities of life could not\nteach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had\nthis one day of strange experiences. Yet there were\ntwo thoughts which sealed the words of affection\nupon my lips. She was weak and helpless, shaken\nin mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disad-\nvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If Holmes\u2019s researches\nwere successful, she would be an heiress. Was\nit fair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon\nshould take such advantage of an intimacy which\nchance had brought about? Might she not look\nupon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could\nnot bear to risk that such a thought should cross\nher mind. This Agra treasure intervened like an\nimpassable barrier between us. It was nearly two o\u2019clock when we reached\nMrs. Cecil Forrester\u2019s.

At last, however, there was\nthe glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face\nlooked out at the upper window. \u201cGo on, you drunken vagabone,\u201d said the face. \u201cIf you kick up any more row I\u2019ll open the kennels\nand let out forty-three dogs upon you.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll let one out it\u2019s just what I have come\nfor,\u201d said I. \u201cGo on!\u201d yelled the voice. \u201cSo help me gra-\ncious, I have a wiper in the bag, an\u2019 I\u2019ll drop it on\nyour \u2019ead if you don\u2019t hook it.\u201d\n\u201cBut I want a dog,\u201d I cried. \u201cI won\u2019t be argued with!\u201d shouted Mr. Sher-\nman. \u201cNow stand clear, for when I say \u2018three,\u2019\ndown goes the wiper.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes\u2014\u201d I began, but the\nwords had a most magical effect, for the window\ninstantly slammed down, and within a minute the\ndoor was unbarred and open."

In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly\nthat there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping\ndown at us from every cranny and corner. Even\nthe rafters above our heads were lined by solemn\nfowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg\nto the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers. Toby proved to an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared\ncreature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-\nand-white in color, with a very clumsy waddling\ngait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump\nof sugar which the old naturalist handed to me,\nand, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed\nme to the cab, and made no dif\ufb01culties about ac-\ncompanying me. It had just struck three on the\nPalace clock when I found myself back once more\nat Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-\ufb01ghter Mc-\nMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory,\nand both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off\nto the station. Two constables guarded the narrow\ngate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on\nmy mentioning the detective\u2019s name. Holmes was standing on the door-step, with\nhis hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe. \u201cAh, you have him there!\u201d said he. \u201cGood dog,\nthen! Athelney Jones has gone. We have had an\nimmense display of energy since you left. He has\narrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gate-\nkeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant\nup-stairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.\u201d\nWe tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended\nthe stairs. The room was as he had left it, save that\na sheet had been draped over the central \ufb01gure. A\nweary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the cor-\nner. \u201cLend me your bull\u2019s-eye, sergeant,\u201d said my\ncompanion. \u201cNow tie this bit of card round my\nneck, so as to hang it in front of me.

I\nshall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my\nhand.\u201d\nI did as he directed, and was instantly con-\nscious of a strong tarry smell. \u201cThat is where he put his foot in getting out. If you can trace him, I should think that Toby will\nhave no dif\ufb01culty. Now run down-stairs, loose the\ndog, and look out for Blondin.\u201d\nBy the time that I got out into the grounds\nSherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see\nhim like an enormous glow-worm crawling very\nslowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind\na stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared,\nand then vanished once more upon the opposite\nside. When I made my way round there I found\nhim seated at one of the corner eaves. \u201cThat You, Watson?\u201d he cried. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the place.

It\u2019s a most break-neck\nplace. I ought to be able to come down where he\ncould climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty \ufb01rm. Here goes, anyhow.\u201d\nThere was a scuf\ufb02ing of feet, and the lantern\nbegan to come steadily down the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel,\nand from there to the earth. \u201cIt was easy to follow him,\u201d he said, drawing\non his stockings and boots. \u201cTiles were loosened\nthe whole way along, and in his hurry he had\ndropped this. It con\ufb01rms my diagnosis, as you\ndoctors express it.\u201d\nThe object which he held up to me was a small\npocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and\nwith a few tawdry beads strung round it. In shape\nand size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside\nwere half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at\none end and rounded at the other, like that which\nhad struck Bartholomew Sholto."

Holmes\nthen threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened\na stout cord to the mongrel\u2019s collar, and let him to\nthe foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly\nbroke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps,\nand, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in\nthe air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which\nstrained his leash and kept us at the top of our\nspeed. The east had been gradually whitening, and we\ncould now see some distance in the cold gray light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty\nwindows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad\nand forlorn, behind us. Our course let right across\nthe grounds, in and out among the trenches and\npits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and\nill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look\nwhich harmonized with the black tragedy which\nhung over it. On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along,\nwhining eagerly,\nunderneath its shadow,\nand\nstopped \ufb01nally in a corner screened by a young\nbeech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks\nhad been loosened, and the crevices left were worn\ndown and rounded upon the lower side, as though\nthey had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes\nclambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he\ndropped it over upon the other side. 88\nThe Sign of the Four\n\u201cThere\u2019s the print of wooden-leg\u2019s hand,\u201d he\nremarked, as I mounted up beside him. \u201cYou see\nthe slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very\nheavy rain since yesterday! The scent will lie upon\nthe road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours\u2019\nstart.\u201d\nI confess that I had my doubts myself when I\nre\ufb02ected upon the great traf\ufb01c which had passed\nalong the London road in the interval. My fears\nwere soon appeased, however. Toby never hes-\nitated or swerved, but waddled on in his pecu-\nliar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of\nthe creasote rose high above all other contending\nscents. \u201cDo not imagine,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I depend\nfor my success in this case upon the mere chance\nof one of these fellows having put his foot in the\nchemical."

This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune\nhas put it into our hands, I should be culpable if\nI neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case\nfrom becoming the pretty little intellectual prob-\nlem which it at one time promised to be. There\nmight have been some credit to be gained out of it,\nbut for this too palpable clue.\u201d\n\u201cThere is credit, and to spare,\u201d said I. \u201cI as-\nsure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by\nwhich you obtain your results in this case, even\nmore than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The\nthing seems to me to be deeper and more inexpli-\ncable. How, for example, could you describe with\nsuch con\ufb01dence the wooden-legged man?\u201d\n\u201cPshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don\u2019t wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and\nabove-board. Two of\ufb01cers who are in command\nof a convict-guard learn an important secret as\nto buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by\nan Englishman named Jonathan Small. You re-\nmember that we saw the name upon the chart in\nCaptain Morstan\u2019s possession. He had signed it\nin behalf of himself and his associates,\u2014the sign\nof the four, as he somewhat dramatically called\nit. Aided by this chart, the of\ufb01cers\u2014or one of\nthem\u2014gets the treasure and brings it to England,\nleaving, we will suppose, some condition under\nwhich he received it unful\ufb01lled. Now, then, why\ndid not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time\nwhen Morstan was brought into close association\nwith convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the trea-\nsure because he and his associates were themselves\nconvicts and could not get away.\u201d\n\u201cBut that is mere speculation,\u201d said I. \u201cIt is more than that. It is the only hypothesis\nwhich covers the facts. Let us see how it \ufb01ts in\nwith the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for\nsome years, happy in the possession of his trea-\nsure. Then he receives a letter from India which\ngives him a great fright. What was that?\u201d\n\u201cA letter to say that the men whom he had\nwronged had been set free.\u201d\n\u201cOr had escaped. That is much more likely, for\nhe would have known what their term of impris-\nonment was. It would not have been a surprise\nto him. What does he do then? He guards him-\nself against a wooden-legged man,\u2014a white man,\nmark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for\nhim, and actually \ufb01res a pistol at him. Now, only\none white man\u2019s name is on the chart. The oth-\ners are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no\nother white man. Therefore we may say with con-\n\ufb01dence that the wooden-legged man is identical\nwith Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike yo\nas being faulty?\u201d\n\u201cNo: it is clear and concise.\u201d\n\u201cWell, now, let us put ourselves in the place of\nJonathan Small."

He comes to England with the double idea of\nregaining what he would consider to be his rights\nand of having his revenge upon the man who had\nwronged him. He found out where Sholto lived,\nand very possibly he established communications\nwith some one inside the house. There is this but-\nler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bern-\nstone gives him far from a good character. Small\ncould not \ufb01nd out, however, where the treasure\nwas hid, for no one ever knew, save the major\nand one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly\nSmall learns that the major is on his death-bed. In\na frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him,\nhe runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way\nto the dying man\u2019s window, and is only deterred\nfrom entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man,\nhe enters the room that night, searches his private\npapers in the hope of discovering some memoran-\ndum relating to the treasure, and \ufb01nally leaves a\nmomento of his visit in the short inscription upon\nthe card. He had doubtless planned beforehand\nthat should he slay the major he would leave some\nsuch record upon the body as a sign that it was\nnot a common murder, but, from the point of view\nof the four associates, something in the nature of\nan act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits\nof this kind are common enough in the annals of\n89\nThe Sign of the Four\ncrime, and usually afford valuable indications as\nto the criminal. Do you follow all this?\u201d\n\u201cVery clearly.\u201d\n\u201cNow, what could Jonathan Small do? He\ncould only continue to keep a secret watch upon\nthe efforts made to \ufb01nd the treasure. Possibly\nhe leaves England and only comes back at inter-\nvals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and\nhe is instantly informed of it. We again trace the\npresence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable\nto reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious as-\nsociate, who gets over this dif\ufb01culty, but dips his\nnaked foot into creasote, whence come Toby, and a\nsix-mile limp for a half-pay of\ufb01cer with a damaged\ntendo Achillis.\u201d\n\u201cBut it was the associate, and not Jonathan,\nwho committed the crime.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. And rather to Jonathan\u2019s disgust,\nto judge by the way the stamped about when he\ngot into the room. He bore no grudge against\nBartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if\nhe could have been simply bound and gagged. He\ndid not wish to put his head in a halter. There was\nno help for it, however: the savage instincts of his\ncompanion had broken out, and the poison had\ndone its work: so Jonathan Small left his record,\nlowered the treasure-box to the ground, and fol-\nlowed it himself."

We had during this time been following the\nguidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined\nroads which lead to the metropolis. Now, however,\nwe were beginning to come among continuous\nstreets, where laborers and dockmen were already\nastir, and slatternly women were taking down\nshutters and brushing door-steps.

Strange dogs sauntered up and\nstared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our\ninimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor\nto the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to\nthe ground and an occasional eager whine which\nspoke of a hot scent. We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Cam-\nberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington\nLane, having borne away through the side-streets\nto the east of the Oval.

Then he\nwaddled round in circles, looking up to us from\ntime to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his em-\nbarrassment. \u201cWhat the deuce is the matter with the dog?\u201d\ngrowled Holmes. \u201cThey surely would not take a\ncab, or go off in a balloon.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps they stood here for some time,\u201d I sug-\ngested. 90\nThe Sign of the Four\n\u201cAh! it\u2019s all right.

He was indeed off, for after snif\ufb01ng round\nagain he suddenly made up his mind, and darted\naway with an energy and determination such as he\nhad not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much\nhotter than before, for he had not even to put his\nnose on the ground, but tugged at his leash and\ntried to break into a run. I cold see by the gleam\nin Holmes\u2019s eyes that he thought we were nearing\nthe end of our journey. Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we\ncame to Broderick and Nelson\u2019s large timber-yard,\njust past the White Eagle tavern. Here the dog,\nfrantic with excitement, turned down through the\nside-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers\nwere already at work. On the dog raced through\nsawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a pas-\nsage, between two wood-piles, and \ufb01nally, with a\ntriumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which\nstill stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had\nbeen brought. With lolling tongue and blinking\neyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one\nto the other of us for some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the\ntrolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the\nwhole air was heavy with the smell of creasote. Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each\nother, and then burst simultaneously into an un-\ncontrollable \ufb01t of laughter. CHAPTER VIII. The Baker Street Irregulars\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked. \u201cToby has lost his char-\nacter for infallibility.\u201d\n\u201cHe\nacted\naccording\nto\nhis\nlights,\u201d\nsaid\nHolmes, lifting him down from the barrel and\nwalking him out of the timber-yard. \u201cIf you con-\nsider how much creasote is carted about London in\none day, it is no great wonder that our trail should\nhave been crossed.

As far as we can learn, no actual\ntraces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto\u2019s\nperson, but a valuable collection of Indian gems\nwhich the deceased gentleman had inherited from\nhis father has been carried off. The discovery was\n\ufb01rst made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Wat-\nson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thad-\ndeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.

It is quite certain that\nthe thief or thieves were well acquainted with the\nhouse, for Mr. Jones\u2019s well-known technical knowl-\nedge and his powers of minute observation have\nenabled him to prove conclusively that the mis-\ncreants could not have entered by the door or by\nthe window, but must have made their way across\n93\nThe Sign of the Four\nthe roof of the building, and so through a trap-\ndoor into a room which communicated with that\nin which the body was found. This fact, which\nhas been very clearly made out, proves conclu-\nsively that it was no mere haphazard burglary.

The sandal-\nwearing Mohammedan has the great toe well sep-\narated from the others, because the thong is com-\nmonly passed between. These little darts, too,\ncould only be shot in one way.

The average height is rather below four feet,\nalthough many full-grown adults may be found\nwho are very much smaller than this.

I have set\nother agencies at work, and used every means at\nmy disposal. The whole river has been searched\non either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs.\nSmith heard of her husband. I shall come to the\nconclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft. But there are objections to that.\u201d\n\u201cOr that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong\nscent.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think that may be dismissed. I had in-\nquiries made, and there is a launch of that descrip-\ntion.\u201d\n\u201cCould it have gone up the river?\u201d\n\u201cI have considered that possibility too, and\nthere is a search-party who will work up as far as\nRichmond. If no news comes to-day, I shall start\noff myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather\nthan the boat. But surely, surely, we shall hear\nsomething.\u201d\nWe did not, however. Not a word came to us\neither from Wiggins or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the\n96\nThe Sign of the Four\nNorwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather\nhostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No\nfresh details were to be found, however, in any of\nthem, save that an inquest was to be held upon the\nfollowing day. I walked over to Camberwell in the\nevening to report our ill success to the ladies, and\non my return I found Holmes dejected and some-\nwhat morose. He would hardly reply to my ques-\ntions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse\nchemical analysis which involved much heating of\nretorts and distilling of vapors, ending at last in a\nsmell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear\nthe clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he\nwas still engaged in his malodorous experiment. In the early dawn I woke with a start, and\nwas surprised to \ufb01nd him standing by my bed-\nside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket,\nand a coarse red scarf round his neck. \u201cI am off down the river, Watson,\u201d said he."

If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so\nvery long. I shall have news of some sort or other\nbefore I get back.\u201d\nI had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the Standard, however, I found that\nthere was a fresh allusion to the business. \u201cWith reference to the Upper Norwood\ntragedy,\u201d it remarked, \u201cwe have reason to\nbelieve that the matter promises to be even\nmore complex and mysterious than was\noriginally supposed. Fresh evidence has\nshown that it is quite impossible that Mr.\nThaddeus Sholto could have been in any\nway concerned in the matter. He and the\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both re-\nleased yesterday evening. It is believed,\nhowever, that the police have a clue as to\nthe real culprits, and that it is being pros-\necuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland\nYard, with all his well-known energy and\nsagacity. Further arrests may be expected\nat any moment.\u201d\n\u201cThat is satisfactory so far as it goes,\u201d thought I. \u201cFriend Sholto is safe, at any rate. I wonder what\nthe fresh clue may be; though it seems to be a\nstereotyped form whenever the police have made\na blunder.\u201d\nI tossed the paper down upon the table, but at\nthat moment my eye caught an advertisement in\nthe agony column. It ran in this way:\n\u201cLost.\u2014Whereas Mordecai Smith, boat-\nman, and his son, Jim, left Smith\u2019s Wharf\nat or about three o\u2019clock last Tuesday morn-\ning in the steam launch Aurora, black with\ntwo red stripes, funnel black with a white\nband, the sum of \ufb01ve pounds will be paid to\nany one who can give information to Mrs.\nSmith, at Smith\u2019s Wharf, or at 221b Baker\nStreet, as to the whereabouts of the said\nMordecai Smith and the launch Aurora.\u201d\nThis was clearly Holmes\u2019s doing. The Baker Street\naddress was enough to prove that. It struck me as\nrather ingenious, because it might be read by the\nfugitives without their seeing in it more than the\nnatural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband. It was a long day. Every time that a knock\ncame to the door, or a sharp step passed in the\nstreet, I imagined that it was either Holmes return-\ning or an answer to his advertisement."

Could there be, I\nwondered, some radical \ufb02aw in my companion\u2019s\nreasoning. Might he be suffering from some huge\nself-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble\nand speculative mind had built up this wild the-\nory upon faulty premises? I had never known him\nto be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may oc-\ncasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to\nfall into error through the over-re\ufb01nement of his\nlogic,\u2014his preference for a subtle and bizarre ex-\nplanation when a plainer and more commonplace\none lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I\nhad myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the\nreasons for his deductions. When I looked back on\nthe long chain of curious circumstances, many of\nthem trivial in themselves, but all tending in the\nsame direction, I could not disguise from myself\nthat even if Holmes\u2019s explanation were incorrect\nthe true theory must be equally outr\u00b4e and startling. 97\nThe Sign of the Four\nAt three o\u2019clock in the afternoon there was a\nloud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the\nhall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr.\nAthelney Jones was shown up to me. Very differ-\nent was he, however, from the brusque and master-\nful professor of common sense who had taken over\nthe case so con\ufb01dently at Upper Norwood. His ex-\npression was downcast, and his bearing meek and\neven apologetic. \u201cGood-day, sir; good-day,\u201d said he. \u201cMr. Sher-\nlock Holmes is out, I understand.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and I cannot be sure when he will be\nback.

It is very hot for the time\nof year; and I have had a good deal to worry and\ntry me. You know my theory about this Norwood\ncase?\u201d\n\u201cI remember that you expressed one.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I\nhad my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir,\nwhen pop he went through a hole in the middle of\nit. He was able to prove an alibi which could not\nbe shaken. From the time that he left his brother\u2019s\nroom he was never out of sight of some one or\nother. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs\nand through trap-doors. It\u2019s a very dark case, and\nmy professional credit is at stake. I should be very\nglad of a little assistance.\u201d\n\u201cWe all need help sometimes,\u201d said I. \u201cYour friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonder-\nful man, sir,\u201d said he, in a husky and con\ufb01dential\nvoice. \u201cHe\u2019s a man who is not to be beat.

He was an aged man,\nclad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket but-\ntoned up to his throat. His back was bowed, his\nknees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully\nasthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel\nhis shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air\ninto his lungs.

He spoke on a quick succession of sub-\njects,\u2014on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery, on\nStradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon,\nand on the war-ships of the future,\u2014handling each\nas though he had made a special study of it.

Tell them to stop opposite Ja-\ncobson\u2019s Yard.\u201d\nOur craft was evidently a very fast one. We\nshot past the long lines of loaded barges as though\nthey were stationary.

You recollect how annoyed I was\nat being balked by so small a thing?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I gave my mind a thorough rest by\nplunging into a chemical analysis. One of our\ngreatest statesmen has said that a change of work\nis the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in\ndissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work\nat, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and\nthought the whole matter out again. My boys had\nbeen up the river and down the river without re-\nsult. The launch was not at any landing-stage or\nwharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly\nhave been scuttled to hide their traces,\u2014though\nthat always remained as a possible hypothesis if\nall else failed. I knew this man Small had a certain\ndegree of low cunning, but I did not think him ca-\npable of anything in the nature of delicate \ufb01nesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I\nthen re\ufb02ected that since he had certainly been in\nLondon some time\u2014as we had evidence that he\nmaintained a continual watch over Pondicherry\nLodge\u2014he could hardly leave at a moment\u2019s no-\ntice, but would need some little time, if it were\nonly a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the\nbalance of probability, at any rate.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to me to be a little weak,\u201d said I. \u201cIt\nis more probable that he had arranged his affairs\nbefore ever he set out upon his expedition.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I hardly think so. This lair of his would\nbe too valuable a retreat in case of need for him\nto give it up until he was sure that he could\ndo without it. But a second consideration struck\nme. Jonathan Small must have felt that the pecu-\nliar appearance of his companion, however much\nhe may have top-coated him, would give rise to\ngossip, and possibly be associated with this Nor-\nwood tragedy."

They paid\nSmith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch\n100\nThe Sign of the Four\nfor the \ufb01nal escape, and hurried to their lodg-\nings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights,\nwhen they had time to see what view the papers\ntook, and whether there was any suspicion, they\nwould make their way under cover of darkness to\nsome ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where\nno doubt they had already arranged for passages\nto America or the Colonies.\u201d\n\u201cBut the launch?

He would send\na scout on ahead, and if anything made him sus-\npicious lie snug for another week.\u201d\n\u201cBut you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith,\nand so been led to their hiding-place,\u201d said I. \u201cIn that case I should have wasted my day. I\nthink that it is a hundred to one against Smith\nknowing where they live. As long as he has liquor\nand good pay, why should he ask questions? They\nsend him messages what to do. No, I thought over\nevery possible course, and this is the best.\u201d\nWhile this conversation had been proceeding,\nwe had been shooting the long series of bridges\nwhich span the Thames. As we passed the City\nthe last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon\nthe summit of St. Paul\u2019s. It was twilight before we\nreached the Tower. \u201cThat is Jacobson\u2019s Yard,\u201d said Holmes, point-\ning to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Sur-\nrey side. \u201cCruise gently up and down here under\ncover of this string of lighters.\u201d He took a pair of\nnight-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time\nat the shore. \u201cI see my sentry at his post,\u201d he re-\nmarked, \u201cbut no sign of a handkerchief.\u201d\n\u201cSuppose we go down-stream a short way and\nlie in wait for them,\u201d said Jones, eagerly. We were\nall eager by this time, even the policemen and stok-\ners, who had a very vague idea of what was going\nforward. \u201cWe\nhave\nno\nright\nto\ntake\nanything\nfor\ngranted,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cIt is certainly ten\nto one that they go down-stream, but we cannot\nbe certain. From this point we can see the entrance\nof the yard, and they can hardly see us. It will\nbe a clear night and plenty of light. We must stay\nwhere we are. See how the folk swarm over yon-\nder in the gaslight.\u201d\n\u201cThey are coming from work in the yard.\u201d\n\u201cDirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one\nhas some little immortal spark concealed about\nhim. You would not think it, to look at them. There\nis no a priori probability about it. A strange enigma\nis man!\u201d\n\u201cSome one calls him a soul concealed in an an-\nimal,\u201d I suggested."

You can, for\nexample, never foretell what any one man will do,\nbut you can say with precision what an average\nnumber will be up to. Individuals vary, but per-\ncentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief? Surely there is a white\n\ufb02utter over yonder.\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is your boy,\u201d I cried. \u201cI can see him\nplainly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there is the Aurora,\u201d exclaimed Holmes,\n\u201cand going like the devil! Full speed ahead, en-\ngineer. Make after that launch with the yellow\nlight. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if\nshe proves to have the heels of us!\u201d\nShe had slipped unseen through the yard-\nentrance and passed behind two or three small\ncraft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before\nwe saw her. Now she was \ufb02ying down the stream,\nnear in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head. \u201cShe is very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt if we shall\ncatch her.\u201d\n\u201cWe must catch her!\u201d cried Holmes, between\nhis teeth. \u201cHeap it on, stokers! Make her do all\nshe can! If we burn the boat we must have them!\u201d\nWe were fairly after her now. The furnaces\nroared, and the powerful engines whizzed and\nclanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp,\nsteep prow cut through the river-water and sent\ntwo rolling waves to right and to left of us. With\nevery throb of the engines we sprang and quivered\nlike a living thing. One great yellow lantern in\nour bows threw a long, \ufb02ickering funnel of light in\nfront of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the wa-\nter showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of\nwhite foam behind her spoke of the pace at which\nshe was going. We \ufb02ashed past barges, steamers,\nmerchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and\nround the other. Voices hailed us out of the dark-\nness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we\nfollowed close upon her track. \u201cPile it on, men, pile it on!\u201d cried Holmes, look-\ning down into the engine-room, while the \ufb01erce\nglow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline\nface. \u201cGet every pound of steam you can.\u201d\n\u201cI think we gain a little,\u201d said Jones, with his\neyes on thea Aurora. \u201cI am sure of it,\u201d said I. \u201cWe shall be up with\nher in a very few minutes.\u201d\nAt that moment, however, as our evil fate\nwould have it, a tug with three barges in tow blun-\ndered in between us. It was only by putting our\nhelm hard down that we avoided a collision, and\nbefore we could round them and recover our way\nthe Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky\nuncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit\nnight."

We had\nshot through the Pool, past the West India Docks,\ndown the long Deptford Reach, and up again af-\nter rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in\nfront of us resolved itself now clearly enough into\nthe dainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light\nupon her, so that we could plainly see the \ufb01gures\nupon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with\nsomething black between his knees over which he\nstooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked\nlike a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller,\nwhile against the red glare of the furnace I could\nsee old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovel-\nling coals for dear life. They may have had some\ndoubt at \ufb01rst as to whether we were really pur-\nsuing them, but now as we followed every wind-\ning and turning which they took there could no\nlonger be any question about it. At Greenwich\nwe were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than\ntwo hundred and \ufb01fty. I have coursed many crea-\ntures in many countries during my checkered ca-\nreer, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill\nas this mad, \ufb02ying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In\nthe silence of the night we could hear the panting\nand clanking of their machinery. The man in the\nstern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms\nwere moving as though he were busy, while ev-\nery now and then he would look up and measure\nwith a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them\nto stop. We were not more than four boat\u2019s lengths\nbehind them, both boats \ufb02ying at a tremendous\npace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Bark-\ning Level upon one side and the melancholy Plum-\nstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man\nin the stern sprang up from the deck and shook\nhis two clinched \ufb01sts at us, cursing the while in a\nhigh, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, pow-\nerful man, and as he stood poising himself with\nlegs astride I could see that from the thigh down-\nwards there was but a wooden stump upon the\nright side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries\nthere was movement in the huddled bundle upon\n102\nThe Sign of the Four\nthe deck. It straightened itself into a little black\nman\u2014the smallest I have ever seen\u2014with a great,\nmisshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishev-\nelled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver,\nand I whipped out mine at the sight of this sav-\nage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some\nsort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his\nface exposed; but that face was enough to give a\nman a sleepless night."

His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre\nlight, and his thick lips were writhed back from\nhis teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with\na half animal fury. \u201cFire if he raises his hand,\u201d said Holmes, qui-\netly. We were within a boat\u2019s-length by this time,\nand almost within touch of our quarry. I can see\nthe two of them now as they stood, the white man\nwith his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and\nthe unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and\nhis strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light\nof our lantern. It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he plucked out from under\nhis covering a short, round piece of wood, like a\nschool-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pis-\ntols rang out together. He whirled round, threw\nup his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell\nsideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of\nhis venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl\nof the waters. At the same moment the wooden-\nlegged man threw himself upon the rudder and\nput it hard down, so that his boat made straight\nin for the southern bank, while we shot past her\nstern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were\nround after her in an instant, but she was already\nnearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate\nplace, where the moon glimmered upon a wide ex-\npanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water\nand beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with\na dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her\nbow in the air and her stern \ufb02ush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly\nsank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain\nhe struggled and writhed. Not one step could he\npossibly take either forwards or backwards. He\nyelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into\nthe mud with his other foot, but his struggles only\nbored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky\nbank. When we brought our launch alongside he\nwas so \ufb01rmly anchored that it was only by throw-\ning the end of a rope over his shoulders that we\nwere able to haul him out, and to drag him, like\nsome evil \ufb01sh, over our side. The two Smiths,\nfather and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but\ncame aboard meekly enough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast\nto our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian work-\nmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could\nbe no question, was the same that had contained\nthe ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was\nno key, but it was of considerable weight, so we\ntransferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As\nwe steamed slowly up-stream again, we \ufb02ashed\nour search-light in every direction, but there was\nno sign of the Islander."

It must\nhave whizzed between us at the instant that we\n\ufb01red. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoul-\nders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned\nme sick to think of the horrible death which had\npassed so close to us that night. CHAPTER XI. The Great Agra Treasure\nOur captive sat in the cabin opposite to the\niron box which he had done so much and waited\nso long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-\neyed fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles\nall over his mahogany features, which told of a\nhard, open-air life. There was a singular promi-\nnence about his bearded chin which marked a man\nwho was not to be easily turned from his purpose. 103\nThe Sign of the Four\nHis age may have been \ufb01fty or thereabouts, for his\nblack, curly hair was thickly shot with gray. His\nface in repose was not an unpleasing one, though\nhis heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him,\nas I had lately seen, a terrible expression when\nmoved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed\nhands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his\nbreast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling\neyes at the box which had been the cause of his\nill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more\nsorrow than anger in his rigid and contained coun-\ntenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of\nsomething like humor in his eyes. \u201cWell, Jonathan Small,\u201d said Holmes, lighting\na cigar, \u201cI am sorry that it has come to this.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so am I, sir,\u201d he answered, frankly. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t believe that I can swing over the job. I give\nyou my word on the book that I never raised hand\nagainst Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound\nTonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had\nbeen my blood-relation. I welted the little devil\nwith the slack end of the rope for it, but it was\ndone, and I could not undo it again.\u201d\n\u201cHave a cigar,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cand you had best\ntake a pull out of my \ufb02ask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man\nas this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and\nhold him while you were climbing the rope?\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to know as much about it as if you\nwere there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to \ufb01nd\nthe room clear. I knew the habits of the house\npretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto\nusually went down to his supper."

As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back\nin his chair and laughed aloud. \u201cThis is your doing, Small,\u201d said Athelney\nJones, angrily."

I tell you that no\nliving man has any right to it, unless it is three\nmen who are in the Andaman convict-barracks\nand myself. I know now that I cannot have the\nuse of it, and I know that they cannot. I have\nacted all through for them as much as for myself. It\u2019s been the sign of four with us always. Well I\nknow that they would have had me do just what I\nhave done, and throw the treasure into the Thames\nrather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of\nMorstan. It was not to make them rich that we did\nfor Achmet. You\u2019ll \ufb01nd the treasure where the key\nis, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your\nlaunch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe\nplace. There are no rupees for you this journey.\u201d\n\u201cYou are deceiving us, Small,\u201d said Athelney\nJones, sternly. \u201cIf you had wished to throw the\ntreasure into the Thames it would have been eas-\nier for you to have thrown box and all.\u201d\n\u201cEasier for me to throw, and easier for you to\nrecover,\u201d he answered, with a shrewd, sidelong\nlook. \u201cThe man that was clever enough to hunt me\ndown is clever enough to pick an iron box from the\nbottom of a river. Now that they are scattered over\n\ufb01ve miles or so, it may be a harder job. It went to\nmy heart to do it, though. I was half mad when\n106\nThe Sign of the Four\nyou came up with us. However, there\u2019s no good\ngrieving over it.

Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where\nis the justice that I should give it up to those who\nhave never earned it? Look how I have earned\nit! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp,\nall day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night\nchained up in the \ufb01lthy convict-huts, bitten by\nmosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every\ncursed black-faced policeman who loved to take\nit out of a white man. That was how I earned the\nAgra treasure; and you talk to me of justice be-\ncause I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this\nprice only that another may enjoy it! I would\nrather swing a score of times, or have one of\nTonga\u2019s darts in my hide, than live in a convict\u2019s\ncell and feel that another man is at his ease in a\npalace with the money that should be mine.\u201d Small\nhad dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this\ncame out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes\nblazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with\nthe impassioned movement of his hands."

Thank you; you can put the glass beside me\nhere, and I\u2019ll put my lips to it if I am dry. \u201cI am a Worcestershire man myself,\u2014born near\nPershore. I dare say you would \ufb01nd a heap of\nSmalls living there now if you were to look. I have\noften thought of taking a look round there, but the\ntruth is that I was never much of a credit to the\nfamily, and I doubt if they would be so very glad\nto see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk,\nsmall farmers, well known and respected over the\ncountry-side, while I was always a bit of a rover. At\nlast, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave\nthem no more trouble, for I got into a mess over\na girl, and could only get out of it again by tak-\ning the queen\u2019s shilling and joining the 3d Buffs,\nwhich was just starting for India. \u201cI wasn\u2019t destined to do much soldiering, how-\never. I had just got past the goose-step, and\nlearned to handle my musket, when I was fool\nenough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily\nfor me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was\nin the water at the same time, and he was one of\nthe \ufb01nest swimmers in the service. A crocodile\ntook me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped\noff my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have\ndone it, just above the knee. What with the shock\nand the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have\ndrowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and\npaddled for the bank. I was \ufb01ve months in hospital\nover it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it\nwith this timber toe strapped to my stump I found\nmyself invalided out of the army and un\ufb01tted for\nany active occupation. \u201cI was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my\nluck at this time, for I was a useless cripple though\nnot yet in my twentieth year. However, my misfor-\ntune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A\nman named Abelwhite, who had come out there as\nan indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after\nhis coolies and keep them up to their work."

To make\na long story short, the colonel recommended me\nstrongly for the post and, as the work was mostly\nto be done on horseback, my leg was no great ob-\nstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep good grip\non the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over\nthe plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they\nworked, and to report the idlers. The pay was\nfair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I\nwas content to spend the remainder of my life in\nindigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man,\nand he would often drop into my little shanty and\nsmoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel\ntheir hearts warm to each other as they never do\nhere at home. \u201cWell, I was never in luck\u2019s way long. Sud-\ndenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny\nbroke upon us. One month India lay as still and\npeaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the\nnext there were two hundred thousand black dev-\nils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of\ncourse you know all about it, gentlemen,\u2014a deal\nmore than I do, very like, since reading is not in\n107\nThe Sign of the Four\nmy line. I only know what I saw with my own\neyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra,\nnear the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night\nafter night the whole sky was alight with the burn-\ning bungalows, and day after day we had small\ncompanies of Europeans passing through our es-\ntate with their wives and children, on their way\nto Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abel-\nwhite was an obstinate man. He had it in his head\nthat the affair had been exaggerated, and that it\nwould blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-\npegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was\nin a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him,\nI and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the\nbook-work and the managing. Well, one \ufb01ne day\nthe crash came. I had been away on a distant plan-\ntation, and was riding slowly home in the evening,\nwhen my eye fell upon something all huddled to-\ngether at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down\nto see what it was, and the cold struck through my\nheart when I found it was Dawson\u2019s wife, all cut\ninto ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native\ndogs. A little further up the road Dawson him-\nself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an\nempty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying\nacross each other in front of him. I reined up my\nhorse, wondering which way I should turn, but at\nthat moment I saw thick smoke curling up from\nAbelwhite\u2019s bungalow and the \ufb02ames beginning\nto burst through the roof."

From\nwhere I stood I could see hundreds of the black\n\ufb01ends, with their red coats still on their backs,\ndancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bul-\nlets sang past my head; so I broke away across the\npaddy-\ufb01elds, and found myself late at night safe\nwithin the walls at Agra. \u201cAs it proved, however, there was no great\nsafety there, either. The whole country was up\nlike a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could\ncollect in little bands they held just the ground\nthat their guns commanded. Everywhere else they\nwere helpless fugitives. It was a \ufb01ght of the mil-\nlions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part\nof it was that these men that we fought against,\nfoot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked\ntroops, whom we had taught and trained, han-\ndling our own weapons, and blowing our own\nbugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3d Bengal\nFusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a\nbattery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks\nand merchants had been formed, and this I joined,\nwooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels\nat Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back\nfor a time, but our powder gave out, and we had\nto fall back upon the city. Nothing but the worst\nnews came to us from every side,\u2014which is not to\nbe wondered at, for if you look at the map you will\nsee that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow\nis rather better than a hundred miles to the east,\nand Cawnpore about as far to the south. From ev-\nery point on the compass there was nothing but\ntorture and murder and outrage. \u201cThe city of Agra is a great place, swarming\nwith fanatics and \ufb01erce devil-worshippers of all\nsorts. Our handful of men were lost among the\nnarrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across\nthe river, therefore, and took up his position in the\nold fort at Agra. I don\u2019t know if any of you gentle-\nmen have ever read or heard anything of that old\nfort. It is a very queer place,\u2014the queerest that\never I was in, and I have been in some rum corners,\ntoo. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should\nthink that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a modern part, which took all our garri-\nson, women, children, stores, and everything else,\nwith plenty of room over. But the modern part\nis nothing like the size of the old quarter, where\nnobody goes, and which is given over to the scor-\npions and the centipedes. It is all full of great de-\nserted halls, and winding passages, and long cor-\nridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough\nfor folk to get lost in it."

We\nwere short-handed, with hardly men enough to\nman the angles of the building and to serve the\nguns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to sta-\ntion a strong guard at every one of the innumer-\nable gates. What we did was to organize a cen-\ntral guard-house in the middle of the fort, and\nto leave each gate under the charge of one white\nman and two or three natives. I was selected to\ntake charge during certain hours of the night of\na small isolated door upon the southwest side of\nthe building. Two Sikh troopers were placed un-\nder my command, and I was instructed if anything\nwent wrong to \ufb01re my musket, when I might rely\nupon help coming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away,\nhowever, and as the space between was cut up into\na labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great\n108\nThe Sign of the Four\ndoubts as to whether they could arrive in time to\nbe of any use in case of an actual attack. \u201cWell, I was pretty proud at having this small\ncommand given me, since I was a raw recruit, and\na game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept\nthe watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall,\n\ufb01erce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdul-\nlah Khan by name, both old \ufb01ghting-men who had\nborne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They\ncould talk English pretty well, but I could get little\nout of them. They preferred to stand together and\njabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For my-\nself, I used to stand outside the gate-way, looking\ndown on the broad, winding river and on the twin-\nkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums,\nthe rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of\nthe rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were\nenough to remind us all night of our dangerous\nneighbors across the stream. Every two hours the\nof\ufb01cer of the night used to come round to all the\nposts, to make sure that all was well. \u201cThe third night of my watch was dark and\ndirty, with a small, driving rain. It was dreary\nwork standing in the gate-way hour after hour in\nsuch weather. I tried again and again to make my\nSikhs talk, but without much success. At two in\nthe morning the rounds passed, and broke for a\nmoment the weariness of the night. Finding that\nmy companions would not be led into conversa-\ntion, I took out my pipe, and laid down my mus-\nket to strike the match."

We ask you to be rich. If you\nwill be one of us this night, we will swear to you\nupon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath\nwhich no Sikh was ever known to break, that you\nshall have your fair share of the loot.

Much has come to him from his father, and more\nstill he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature\nand hoards his gold rather than spend it. When\nthe troubles broke out he would be friends both\nwith the lion and the tiger,\u2014with the Sepoy and\nwith the Company\u2019s raj. Soon, however, it seemed\nto him that the white men\u2019s day was come, for\nthrough all the land he could hear of nothing but\nof their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a\ncareful man, he made such plans that, come what\nmight, half at least of his treasure should be left to\nhim. That which was in gold and silver he kept by\nhim in the vaults of his palace, but the most pre-\ncious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he\nput in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant\nwho, under the guise of a merchant, should take it\nto the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at\npeace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his\nmoney, but if the Company conquered his jewels\nwould be saved to him. Having thus divided his\nhoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Se-\npoys, since they were strong upon his borders. By\ndoing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes\nthe due of those who have been true to their salt. \u201c \u2018This pretended merchant, who travels under\nthe name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra,\nand desires to gain his way into the fort."

I remained at the gate-way with\nthe lantern. \u201cI could hear the measured tramp of their foot-\nsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Sud-\ndenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuf\ufb02e,\nwith the sound of blows. A moment later there\ncame, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in\nmy direction, with the loud breathing of a running\nman. I turned my lantern down the long, straight\npassage, and there was the fat man, running like\nthe wind, with a smear of blood across his face,\nand close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the\ngreat black-bearded Sikh, with a knife \ufb02ashing in\nhis hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as\nthat little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh,\nand I could see that if he once passed me and got\nto the open air he would save himself yet. My\nheart softened to him, but again the thought of\nhis treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my\n\ufb01relock between his legs as he raced past, and he\nrolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he could\nstagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and\nburied his knife twice in his side. The man never\nuttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he\nhad fallen. I think myself that he may have broken\nhis neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I\nam keeping my promise. I am telling you every\nwork of the business just exactly as it happened,\nwhether it is in my favor or not.\u201d\nHe stopped, and held out his manacled hands\nfor the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had\nbrewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had\nnow conceived the utmost horror of the man, not\nonly for this cold-blooded business in which he\nhad been concerned, but even more for the some-\nwhat \ufb02ippant and careless way in which he nar-\nrated it. Whatever punishment was in store for\nhim, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from\nme. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their\nhands upon their knees, deeply interested in the\nstory, but with the same disgust written upon their\nfaces. He may have observed it, for there was a\ntouch of de\ufb01ance in his voice and manner as he\nproceeded. \u201cIt was all very bad, no doubt,\u201d said he. \u201cI\nshould like to know how many fellows in my\nshoes would have refused a share of this loot when\nthey knew that they would have their throats cut\nfor their pains. Besides, it was my life or his when\nonce he was in the fort. If he had got out, the\nwhole business would come to light, and I should\nhave been court-martialled and shot as likely as\nnot; for people were not very lenient at a time like\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cGo on with your story,\u201d said Holmes, shortly. \u201cWell, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and\nI."

It was some distance off, where a\nwinding passage leads to a great empty hall, the\nbrick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth \ufb02oor had sunk in at one place, making\na natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant\nthere, having \ufb01rst covered him over with loose\nbricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure. \u201cIt lay where he had dropped it when he was\n\ufb01rst attacked. The box was the same which now\nlies open upon your table. A key was hung by\na silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed\nupon a collection of gems such as I have read of\nand thought about when I was a little lad at Per-\nshore. It was blinding to look upon them. When\nwe had feasted our eyes we took them all out and\nmade a list of them. There were one hundred and\n111\nThe Sign of the Four\nforty-three diamonds of the \ufb01rst water, including\none which has been called, I believe, \u2018the Great\nMogul\u2019 and is said to be the second largest stone\nin existence. Then there were ninety-seven very\n\ufb01ne emeralds, and one hundred and seventy ru-\nbies, some of which, however, were small. There\nwere forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sap-\nphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of\nberyls, onyxes, cats\u2019-eyes, turquoises, and other\nstones, the very names of which I did not know\nat the time, though I have become more familiar\nwith them since. Besides this, there were nearly\nthree hundred very \ufb01ne pearls, twelve of which\nwere set in a gold coronet. By the way, these last\nhad been taken out of the chest and were not there\nwhen I recovered it. \u201cAfter we had counted our treasures we put\nthem back into the chest and carried them to the\ngate-way to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then\nwe solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each\nother and be true to our secret. We agreed to\nconceal our loot in a safe place until the country\nshould be at peace again, and then to divide it\nequally among ourselves. There was no use di-\nviding it at present, for if gems of such value were\nfound upon us it would cause suspicion, and there\nwas no privacy in the fort nor any place where\nwe could keep them. We carried the box, there-\nfore, into the same hall where we had buried the\nbody, and there, under certain bricks in the best-\npreserved wall, we made a hollow and put our\ntreasure. We made careful note of the place, and\nnext day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and\nput the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we\nhad sworn that we should each always act for all,\nso that none might take advantage."

        "text": "That is an oath\nthat I can put my hand to my heart and swear that\nI have never broken. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no use my telling you gentle-\nmen what came of the Indian mutiny. After Wil-\nson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the\nback of the business was broken. Fresh troops\ncame pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself\nscarce over the frontier. A \ufb02ying column under\nColonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared\nthe Pandies away from it. Peace seemed to be set-\ntling upon the country, and we four were begin-\nning to hope that the time was at hand when we\nmight safely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered\nby our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet. \u201cIt came about in this way. When the rajah put\nhis jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it be-\ncause he knew that he was a trusty man. They\nare suspicious folk in the East, however: so what\ndoes this rajah do but take a second even more\ntrusty servant and set him to play the spy upon\nthe \ufb01rst? This second man was ordered never to\nlet Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him\nlike his shadow. He went after him that night and\nsaw him pass through the doorway. Of course\nhe thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and\napplied for admission there himself next day, but\ncould \ufb01nd no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him\nso strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of\nguides, who brought it to the ears of the comman-\ndant. A thorough search was quickly made, and\nthe body was discovered. Thus at the very mo-\nment that we thought that all was safe we were\nall four seized and brought to trial on a charge of\nmurder,\u2014three of us because we had held the gate\nthat night, and the fourth because he was known\nto have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial,\nfor the rajah had been deposed and driven out\nof India: so no one had any particular interest in\nthem. The murder, however, was clearly made out,\nand it was certain that we must all have been con-\ncerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude\nfor life, and I was condemned to death, though my\nsentence was afterwards commuted into the same\nas the others. \u201cIt was rather a queer position that we found\nourselves in then. There we were all four tied by\nthe leg and with precious little chance of ever get-\nting out again, while we each held a secret which\nmight have put each of us in a palace if we could\nonly have made use of it. It was enough to make\na man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick\nand the cuff of every petty jack-in-of\ufb01ce, to have\nrice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous\nfortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to\nbe picked up."

I was\nchanged from Agra to Madras, and from there to\nBlair Island in the Andamans. There are very few\nwhite convicts at this settlement, and, as I had be-\nhaved well from the \ufb01rst, I soon found myself a\nsort of privileged person. I was given a hut in\nHope Town, which is a small place on the slopes\nof Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to\nmyself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all\nbeyond our little clearings was infested with wild\ncannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow\na poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There\nwas digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and\na dozen other things to be done, so we were busy\n112\nThe Sign of the Four\nenough all day; though in the evening we had a\nlittle time to ourselves. Among other things, I\nlearned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and\npicked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the\ntime I was on the lookout for a chance of escape;\nbut it is hundreds of miles from any other land,\nand there is little or no wind in those seas: so it\nwas a terribly dif\ufb01cult job to get away. \u201cThe surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sport-\ning young chap, and the other young of\ufb01cers\nwould meet in his rooms of an evening and play\ncards. The surgery, where I used to make up my\ndrugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small\nwindow between us. Often, if I felt lonesome,\nI used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and\nthen, standing there, I could hear their talk and\nwatch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards\nmyself, and it was almost as good as having one\nto watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Cap-\ntain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who\nwere in command of the native troops, and there\nwas the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-\nof\ufb01cials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly\nsafe game. A very snug little party they used to\nmake. \u201cWell, there was one thing which very soon\nstruck me, and that was that the soldiers used al-\nways to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I don\u2019t\nsay that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These prison-chaps had done little else than play\ncards ever since they had been at the Andamans,\nand they knew each other\u2019s game to a point, while\nthe others just played to pass the time and threw\ntheir cards down anyhow. Night after night the\nsoldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they\ngot the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto\nwas the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and\ngold at \ufb01rst, but soon it came to notes of hand\nand for big sums."

We talked the matter\nover again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provide both the of\ufb01cers with charts of\nthe part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the\nwall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was\nto go to India to test our story.

To escape,\nto track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his\nthroat,\u2014that was my one thought. Even the Agra\ntreasure had come to be a smaller thing in my\nmind than the slaying of Sholto. \u201cWell, I have set my mind on many things in\nthis life, and never one which I did not carry out.

He was to\nbring his boat round on a certain night to an old\nwharf which was never guarded, and there he was\nto pick me up.

I brought him out\nwith me with a long rope wound round his waist. 115\nThe Sign of the Four\nHe could climb like a cat, and he soon made his\nway through the roof, but, as ill luck would have\nit, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to\nhis cost. Tonga thought he had done something\nvery clever in killing him, for when I came up by\nthe rope I found him strutting about as proud as\na peacock. Very much surprised was he when I\nmade at him with the rope\u2019s end and cursed him\nfor a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-\nbox and let it down, and then slid down myself,\nhaving \ufb01rst left the sign of the four upon the ta-\nble, to show that the jewels had come back at last\nto those who had most right to them. Tonga then\npulled up the rope, closed the window, and made\noff the way that he had come. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have anything else to tell\nyou. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of\nSmith\u2019s launch, the Aurora, so I thought she would\nbe a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with\nold Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he\ngot us safe to our ship. He knew, no doubt, that\nthere was some screw loose, but he was not in our\nsecrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you,\ngentlemen, it is not to amuse you,\u2014for you have\nnot done me a very good turn,\u2014but it is because I\nbelieve the best defence I can make is just to hold\nback nothing, but let all the wold know how badly\nI have myself been served by Major Sholto, and\nhow innocent I am of the death of his son.\u201d\n\u201cA very remarkable account,\u201d said Sherlock\nHolmes. \u201cA \ufb01tting wind-up to an extremely in-\nteresting case. There is nothing at all new to me\nin the latter part of your narrative, except that you\nbrought your own rope. That I did not know. By\nthe way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his\ndarts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the\nboat.\u201d\n\u201cHe had lost them all, sir, except the one which\nwas in his blow-pipe at the time.\u201d\n\u201cAh, of course,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI had not\nthought of that.\u201d\n\u201cIs there any other point which you would like\nto ask about?\u201d asked the convict, affably. \u201cI think not, thank you,\u201d my companion an-\nswered. \u201cWell, Holmes,\u201d said Athelney Jones, \u201cYou are\na man to be humored, and we all know that you\nare a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I\nhave gone rather far in doing what you and your\nfriend asked me."

I have seldom heard him men-\ntion her under any other name. In his\neyes she eclipses and predominates the\nwhole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emo-\ntion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\nthat one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold,\nprecise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I\ntake it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\nmachine that the world has seen, but as a lover\nhe would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a\ngibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for\nthe observer\u2014excellent for drawing the veil from\nmen\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained rea-\nsoner to admit such intrusions into his own del-\nicate and \ufb01nely adjusted temperament was to in-\ntroduce a distracting factor which might throw a\ndoubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensi-\ntive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-\npower lenses, would not be more disturbing than\na strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet\nthere was but one woman to him, and that woman\nwas the late Irene Adler, of dubious and question-\nable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage\nhad drifted us away from each other. My own\ncomplete happiness, and the home-centred inter-\nests which rise up around the man who \ufb01rst \ufb01nds\nhimself master of his own establishment, were suf-\n\ufb01cient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes,\nwho loathed every form of society with his whole\nBohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker\nStreet, buried among his old books, and alternat-\ning from week to week between cocaine and am-\nbition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the \ufb01erce\nenergy of his own keen nature."

From\ntime to time I heard some vague account of his\ndoings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of\nthe Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the sin-\ngular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trinco-\nmalee, and \ufb01nally of the mission which he had ac-\ncomplished so delicately and successfully for the\nreigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with\nall the readers of the daily press, I knew little of\nmy former friend and companion. One night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March,\n1888\u2014I was returning from a journey to a patient\n(for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\nway led me through Baker Street. As I passed the\nwell-remembered door, which must always be as-\nsociated in my mind with my wooing, and with\nthe dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was\nseized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and\nto know how he was employing his extraordinary\npowers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as\nI looked up, I saw his tall, spare \ufb01gure pass twice\nin a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pac-\ning the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk\nupon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his at-\ntitude and manner told their own story. He was at\nwork again. He had risen out of his drug-created\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new\nproblem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the\nchamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was;\nbut he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly\na word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,\nand indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the\ncorner. Then he stood before the \ufb01re and looked\nme over in his singular introspective fashion. \u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think,\nWatson, that you have put on seven and a half\npounds since I saw you.\u201d\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered. \u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a tri\ufb02e more, I fancy, Watson. And in prac-\ntice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\nintended to go into harness.\u201d\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you\nhave been getting yourself very wet lately, and that\nyou have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you\nlived a few centuries ago."

Obviously they have\nbeen caused by someone who has very carelessly\nscraped round the edges of the sole in order to re-\nmove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my\ndouble deduction that you had been out in vile\nweather, and that you had a particularly malignant\nboot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to\nyour practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms\nsmelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate\nof silver upon his right fore\ufb01nger, and a bulge on\nthe right side of his top-hat to show where he has\nsecreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if\nI do not pronounce him to be an active member of\nthe medical profession.\u201d\nI could not help laughing at the ease with\nwhich he explained his process of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked,\n\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridicu-\nlously simple that I could easily do it myself,\nthough at each successive instance of your rea-\nsoning I am baf\ufb02ed until you explain your pro-\ncess. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as\nyours.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette,\nand throwing himself down into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction\nis clear. For example, you have frequently seen the\nsteps which lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet\nyou have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know\nthat there are seventeen steps, because I have both\nseen and observed. By-the-way, since you are in-\nterested in these little problems, and since you are\ngood enough to chronicle one or two of my tri-\n\ufb02ing experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d\nHe threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-\npaper which had been lying open upon the table. \u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\nThe note was undated, and without either sig-\nnature or address. \u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quar-\nter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it said, \u201ca gentleman who\ndesires to consult you upon a matter of the very\ndeepest moment.

It is a capital mistake to\ntheorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins\nto twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to\nsuit facts. But the note itself.

The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands\nfor \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019 which is the German for \u2018Com-\npany.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like our \u2018Co.\u2019\n\u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019\nNow for the\n\u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d\nHe took down a heavy brown volume from his\nshelves. \u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It\nis in a German-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not\nfar from Carlsbad. \u2018Remarkable as being the scene\nof the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy,\nwhat do you make of that?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and\nhe sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his\ncigarette. \u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said. \u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note\nis a German. Do you note the peculiar construc-\ntion of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have\nfrom all quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Rus-\nsian could not have written that. It is the German\nwho is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only re-\nmains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by\nthis German who writes upon Bohemian paper\nand prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to re-\nsolve all our doubts.\u201d\n124\nA Scandal in Bohemia\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of\nhorses\u2019 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb,\nfollowed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whis-\ntled. \u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he con-\ntinued, glancing out of the window. \u201cA nice little\nbrougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and\n\ufb01fty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case,\nWatson, if there is nothing else.\u201d\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor."

Rather than I\nshould marry another woman, there are no lengths\nto which she would not go\u2014none.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\u201d\n\u201cI am sure.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\n126\nA Scandal in Bohemia\n\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it\non the day when the betrothal was publicly pro-\nclaimed.

Your Majesty will, of course, stay in Lon-\ndon for the present?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his\nnote-book and handed it to him. \u201cAnd Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\u2019s\nWood.\u201d\nHolmes took a note of it. \u201cOne other question,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cWas the photograph a cabinet?\u201d\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\n\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust\nthat we shall soon have some good news for you.

At three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street,\nbut Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady\ninformed me that he had left the house shortly af-\nter eight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down be-\nside the \ufb01re, however, with the intention of await-\ning him, however long he might be. I was already\ndeeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange fea-\ntures which were associated with the two crimes\nwhich I have already recorded, still, the nature of\nthe case and the exalted station of his client gave it\na character of its own. Indeed, apart from the na-\nture of the investigation which my friend had on\nhand, there was something in his masterly grasp\nof a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning,\nwhich made it a pleasure to me to study his sys-\ntem of work, and to follow the quick, subtle meth-\nods by which he disentangled the most inextrica-\nble mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invari-\nable success that the very possibility of his failing\nhad ceased to enter into my head. It was close upon four before the door opened,\nand a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-\nwhiskered, with an in\ufb02amed face and disreputable\nclothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I\nwas to my friend\u2019s amazing powers in the use of\ndisguises, I had to look three times before I was\ncertain that it was indeed he. With a nod he van-\nished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in \ufb01ve\nminutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out\nhis legs in front of the \ufb01re and laughed heartily for\nsome minutes. \u201cWell, really!\u201d he cried, and then he choked\nand laughed again until he was obliged to lie back,\nlimp and helpless, in the chair. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite too funny. I am sure you could never\nguess how I employed my morning, or what I\nended by doing.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. I suppose that you have been\nwatching the habits, and perhaps the house, of\nMiss Irene Adler.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I\nwill tell you, however. I left the house a little af-\nter eight o\u2019clock this morning in the character of a\n127\nA Scandal in Bohemia\ngroom out of work."

It is a bijou\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in\nfront right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock\nto the door. Large sitting-room on the right side,\nwell furnished, with long windows almost to the\n\ufb02oor, and those preposterous English window fas-\nteners which a child could open. Behind there was\nnothing remarkable, save that the passage window\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from ev-\nery point of view, but without noting anything else\nof interest. \u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as\nI expected, that there was a mews in a lane which\nruns down by one wall of the garden. I lent the\nostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and\nreceived in exchange twopence, a glass of half and\nhalf, two \ufb01lls of shag tobacco, and as much infor-\nmation as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neigh-\nbourhood in whom I was not in the least inter-\nested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\nlisten to.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down\nin that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bon-\nnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to\na man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\nout at \ufb01ve every day, and returns at seven sharp\nfor dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except\nwhen she sings. Has only one male visitor, but\na good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and\ndashing, never calls less than once a day, and often\ntwice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner\nTemple. See the advantages of a cabman as a con-\n\ufb01dant. They had driven him home a dozen times\nfrom Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I be-\ngan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once\nmore, and to think over my plan of campaign. \u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an impor-\ntant factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That\nsounded ominous. What was the relation between\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the\nformer, she had probably transferred the photo-\ngraph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether\nI should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or\nturn my attention to the gentleman\u2019s chambers in\nthe Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened\nthe \ufb01eld of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with\nthese details, but I have to let you see my little dif-\n\ufb01culties, if you are to understand the situation.\u201d\n\u201cI am following you closely,\u201d I answered."

He was a remark-\nably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mous-\ntached\u2014evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the\ncabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who\nopened the door with the air of a man who was\nthoroughly at home. \u201cHe was in the house about half an hour, and\nI could catch glimpses of him in the windows of\nthe sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking ex-\ncitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see\nnothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more\n\ufb02urried than before. As he stepped up to the cab,\nhe pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked\nat it earnestly, \u2018Drive like the devil,\u2019 he shouted,\n\u2018\ufb01rst to Gross & Hankey\u2019s in Regent Street, and\nthen to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware\nRoad. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty min-\nutes!\u2019\n\u201cAway they went, and I was just wondering\nwhether I should not do well to follow them when\nup the lane came a neat little landau, the coach-\nman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie\nunder his ear, while all the tags of his harness were\nsticking out of the buckles. It hadn\u2019t pulled up be-\nfore she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she\nwas a lovely woman, with a face that a man might\ndie for. \u201c \u2018The Church of St. Monica, John,\u2019 she cried,\n\u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty min-\nutes.\u2019\n\u201cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I\nwas just balancing whether I should run for it, or\nwhether I should perch behind her landau when\na cab came through the street.

I don\u2019t think I ever drove\nfaster, but the others were there before us. The cab\nand the landau with their steaming horses were\nin front of the door when I arrived. I paid the\nman and hurried into the church. There was not a\nsoul there save the two whom I had followed and\n128\nA Scandal in Bohemia\na surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostu-\nlating with them. They were all three standing in\na knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side\naisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the\naltar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came\nrunning as hard as he could towards me."

The house was just such as I had pictured\nit from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 succinct description, but\nthe locality appeared to be less private than I ex-\npected.

Now the question is,\nWhere are we to \ufb01nd the photograph?\u201d\n\u201cWhere, indeed?\u201d\n\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about\nwith her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy\nconcealment about a woman\u2019s dress. She knows\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and\nsearched. Two attempts of the sort have already\nbeen made.

But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do\ntheir own secreting. Why should she hand it over\nto anyone else? She could trust her own guardian-\nship, but she could not tell what indirect or po-\nlitical in\ufb02uence might be brought to bear upon a\nbusiness man.

A blow was struck, and in an instant\nthe lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was\nthe centre of a little knot of \ufb02ushed and struggling\nmen, who struck savagely at each other with their\n\ufb01sts and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd\nto protect the lady; but just as he reached her he\ngave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the\nblood running freely down his face. At his fall\nthe guardsmen took to their heels in one direction\nand the loungers in the other, while a number of\nbetter-dressed people, who had watched the scuf-\n\ufb02e without taking part in it, crowded in to help\nthe lady and to attend to the injured man."

You,\nof course, saw that everyone in the street was\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the\nevening.\u201d\n\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d\n\u201cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little\nmoist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed\nforward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face,\nand became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\u201d\n\u201cThat also I could fathom.\u201d\n\u201cThen they carried me in. She was bound to\nhave me in. What else could she do? And into\nher sitting-room, which was the very room which\nI suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom,\nand I was determined to see which. They laid me\non a couch, I motioned for air, they were com-\npelled to open the window, and you had your\nchance.\u201d\n\u201cHow did that help you?\u201d\n\u201cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks\nthat her house is on \ufb01re, her instinct is at once to\nrush to the thing which she values most. It is a per-\nfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than\nonce taken advantage of it. In the case of the Dar-\nlington substitution scandal it was of use to me,\nand also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A mar-\nried woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one\nreaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me\nthat our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of \ufb01re was\nadmirably done. The smoke and shouting were\nenough to shake nerves of steel. She responded\nbeautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind\na sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She\nwas there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of\nit as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it\nwas a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the\nrocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen\nher since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped\nfrom the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to\nsecure the photograph at once; but the coachman\nhad come in, and as he was watching me narrowly\nit seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance\nmay ruin all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked. \u201cOur quest is practically \ufb01nished. I shall call\nwith the King to-morrow, and with you, if you\ncare to come with us. We will be shown into the\nsitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable\nthat when she comes she may \ufb01nd neither us nor\nthe photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his\nMajesty to regain it with his own hands.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when will you call?\u201d\n\u201cAt eight in the morning."

He was searching his pockets for the\nkey when someone passing said:\n\u201cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\nThere were several people on the pavement at\nthe time, but the greeting appeared to come from\na slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that voice before,\u201d said Holmes,\nstaring down the dimly lit street. \u201cNow, I wonder\nwho the deuce that could have been.\u201d\nCHAPTER III. I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were\nengaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning\nwhen the King of Bohemia rushed into the room. \u201cYou have really got it!\u201d he cried, grasping\nSherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking\neagerly into his face. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have hopes?\u201d\n\u201cI have hopes.\u201d\n\u201cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\u201d\n\u201cWe must have a cab.\u201d\n\u201cNo, my brougham is waiting.\u201d\n\u201cThen that will simplify matters.\u201d We de-\nscended and started off once more for Briony\nLodge. \u201cIrene Adler is married,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cMarried!

If the lady loves her husband,\nshe does not love your Majesty. If she does not love\nyour Majesty, there is no reason why she should\ninterfere with your Majesty\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\u201cIt is true. And yet\u2014Well! I wish she had been\nof my own station! What a queen she would have\nmade!\u201d He relapsed into a moody silence, which\nwas not broken until we drew up in Serpentine\nAvenue. The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an el-\nderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched\nus with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\nbrougham. \u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\u201d said she. \u201cI am Mr. Holmes,\u201d answered my companion,\nlooking at her with a questioning and rather star-\ntled gaze. \u201cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were\nlikely to call. She left this morning with her hus-\nband by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for the\nContinent.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!\u201d\nSherlock\nHolmes\nstaggered\nback,\nwhite with chagrin and surprise. \u201cDo you mean\nthat she has left England?\u201d\n\u201cNever to return.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the papers?\u201d asked the King hoarsely. \u201cAll is lost.\u201d\n\u201cWe shall see.\u201d He pushed past the servant\nand rushed into the drawing-room, followed by\nthe King and myself. The furniture was scattered\nabout in every direction, with dismantled shelves\nand open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ran-\nsacked them before her \ufb02ight. Holmes rushed at\nthe bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and\na letter."

It was dated at midnight of the preceding\nnight and ran in this way:\n132\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:\n\u201cYou really did it very well. You\ntook me in completely. Until after the\nalarm of \ufb01re, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had be-\ntrayed myself, I began to think. I had\nbeen warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the King em-\nployed an agent it would certainly be\nyou. And your address had been given\nme. Yet, with all this, you made me re-\nveal what you wanted to know. Even\nafter I became suspicious, I found it\nhard to think evil of such a dear, kind\nold clergyman. But, you know, I have\nbeen trained as an actress myself. Male\ncostume is nothing new to me. I often\ntake advantage of the freedom which\nit gives. I sent John, the coachman,\nto watch you, ran up stairs, got into\nmy walking-clothes, as I call them, and\ncame down just as you departed. \u201cWell, I followed you to your door,\nand so made sure that I was really an\nobject of interest to the celebrated Mr.\nSherlock Holmes. Then I, rather im-\nprudently, wished you good-night, and\nstarted for the Temple to see my hus-\nband. \u201cWe both thought the best resource\nwas\n\ufb02ight,\nwhen\npursued\nby\nso\nformidable an antagonist; so you will\n\ufb01nd the nest empty when you call to-\nmorrow. As to the photograph, your\nclient may rest in peace. I love and\nam loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will with-\nout hindrance from one whom he has\ncruelly wronged. I keep it only to\nsafeguard myself, and to preserve a\nweapon which will always secure me\nfrom any steps which he might take in\nthe future. I leave a photograph which\nhe might care to possess; and I remain,\ndear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\n\u201cVery truly yours,\n\u201cIrene Norton, n\u00b4ee Adler.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a woman\u2014oh, what a woman!\u201d cried\nthe King of Bohemia, when we had all three read\nthis epistle. \u201cDid I not tell you how quick and\nresolute she was? Would she not have made an\nadmirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not\non my level?\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I have seen of the lady she seems\nindeed to be on a very different level to your\nMajesty,\u201d said Holmes coldly. \u201cI am sorry that I\nhave not been able to bring your Majesty\u2019s busi-\nness to a more successful conclusion.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\u201d cried the King;\n\u201cnothing could be more successful. I know that\nher word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\nsafe as if it were in the \ufb01re.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\u201d\n\u201cI am immensely indebted to you."

You have heard me remark that the strangest\nand most unique things are very often connected\nnot with the larger but with the smaller crimes,\nand occasionally, indeed, where there is room for\ndoubt whether any positive crime has been com-\nmitted. As far as I have heard it is impossible for\nme to say whether the present case is an instance\nof crime or not, but the course of events is cer-\ntainly among the most singular that I have ever\nlistened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have\nthe great kindness to recommence your narrative. I\nask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson\nhas not heard the opening part but also because\nthe peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious\nto have every possible detail from your lips. As a\nrule, when I have heard some slight indication of\nthe course of events, I am able to guide myself by\nthe thousands of other similar cases which occur\nto my memory. In the present instance I am forced\nto admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief,\nunique.\u201d\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an\nappearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty\nand wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of\nhis greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertise-\nment column, with his head thrust forward and\nthe paper \ufb02attened out upon his knee, I took a\ngood look at the man and endeavoured, after the\nfashion of my companion, to read the indications\nwhich might be presented by his dress or appear-\nance. I did not gain very much, however, by my in-\nspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being\nan average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\npompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey\nshepherd\u2019s check trousers, a not over-clean black\nfrock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and\na square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an\nornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon\na chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would,\nthere was nothing remarkable about the man save\nhis blazing red head, and the expression of ex-\ntreme chagrin and discontent upon his features. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 quick eye took in my occu-\npation, and he shook his head with a smile as he\nnoticed my questioning glances. \u201cBeyond the ob-\nvious facts that he has at some time done manual\nlabour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason,\nthat he has been in China, and that he has done\na considerable amount of writing lately, I can de-\nduce nothing else.\u201d\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with\nhis fore\ufb01nger upon the paper, but his eyes upon\nmy companion."

Snap-\nping away with a camera when he ought to be im-\nproving his mind, and then diving down into the\ncellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pic-\ntures.

We live very\nquietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof\n138\nThe Red-Headed League\nover our heads and pay our debts, if we do noth-\ning more. \u201cThe \ufb01rst thing that put us out was that adver-\ntisement. Spaulding, he came down into the of\ufb01ce\njust this day eight weeks, with this very paper in\nhis hand, and he says:\n\u201c \u2018I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a\nred-headed man.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Why that?\u2019 I asks. \u201c \u2018Why,\u2019 says he, \u2018here\u2019s another vacancy on the\nLeague of the Red-headed Men. It\u2019s worth quite\na little fortune to any man who gets it, and I un-\nderstand that there are more vacancies than there\nare men, so that the trustees are at their wits\u2019 end\nwhat to do with the money.

In that way I didn\u2019t know\nmuch of what was going on outside, and I was\nalways glad of a bit of news. \u201c \u2018Have you never heard of the League of the\nRed-headed Men?\u2019 he asked with his eyes open. \u201c \u2018Never.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible\nyourself for one of the vacancies.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And what are they worth?\u2019 I asked. \u201c \u2018Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but\nthe work is slight, and it need not interfere very\nmuch with one\u2019s other occupations.\u2019\n\u201cWell, you can easily think that that made me\nprick up my ears, for the business has not been\nover-good for some years, and an extra couple of\nhundred would have been very handy. \u201c \u2018Tell me all about it,\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 said he, showing me the advertise-\nment, \u2018you can see for yourself that the League\nhas a vacancy, and there is the address where you\nshould apply for particulars. As far as I can make\nout, the League was founded by an American mil-\nlionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar\nin his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he\nhad a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so\nwhen he died it was found that he had left his\nenormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing\nof easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.

This American had started\nfrom London when he was young, and he wanted\nto do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have\nheard it is no use your applying if your hair is light\nred, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blaz-\ning, \ufb01ery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wil-\nson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would\nhardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\u2019\n\u201cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see\nfor yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and\nrich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was\nto be any competition in the matter I stood as good\na chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent\nSpaulding seemed to know so much about it that\nI thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered\nhim to put up the shutters for the day and to come\nright away with me."

From north, south, east, and west\nevery man who had a shade of red in his hair\nhad tramped into the city to answer the advertise-\nment. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed\nfolk, and Pope\u2019s Court looked like a coster\u2019s or-\nange barrow. I should not have thought there were\nso many in the whole country as were brought to-\ngether by that single advertisement. Every shade\nof colour they were\u2014straw, lemon, orange, brick,\nIrish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there\nwere not many who had the real vivid \ufb02ame-\ncoloured tint. When I saw how many were wait-\ning, I would have given it up in despair; but\nSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it\nI could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled\nand butted until he got me through the crowd, and\nright up to the steps which led to the of\ufb01ce. There\nwas a double stream upon the stair, some going\nup in hope, and some coming back dejected; but\nwe wedged in as well as we could and soon found\nourselves in the of\ufb01ce.\u201d\n\u201cYour experience has been a most entertaining\none,\u201d remarked Holmes as his client paused and\nrefreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \u201cPray continue your very interesting statement.\u201d\n\u201cThere was nothing in the of\ufb01ce but a couple of\nwooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a\nsmall man with a head that was even redder than\n139\nThe Red-Headed League\nmine. He said a few words to each candidate as\nhe came up, and then he always managed to \ufb01nd\nsome fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very\neasy matter, after all. However, when our turn\ncame the little man was much more favourable to\nme than to any of the others, and he closed the\ndoor as we entered, so that he might have a pri-\nvate word with us. \u201c \u2018This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\u2019 said my assistant,\n\u2018and he is willing to \ufb01ll a vacancy in the League.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And he is admirably suited for it,\u2019 the other\nanswered. \u2018He has every requirement. I cannot re-\ncall when I have seen anything so \ufb01ne.\u2019 He took a\nstep backward, cocked his head on one side, and\ngazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then\nsuddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand,\nand congratulated me warmly on my success. \u201c \u2018It would be injustice to hesitate,\u2019 said he. \u2018You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking\nan obvious precaution.\u2019 With that he seized my\nhair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled\nwith the pain. \u2018There is water in your eyes,\u2019 said\nhe as he released me."

A groan of\ndisappointment came up from below, and the folk\nall trooped away in different directions until there\nwas not a red-head to be seen except my own and\nthat of the manager. \u201c \u2018My name,\u2019 said he, \u2018is Mr. Duncan Ross, and\nI am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund\nleft by our noble benefactor.

Besides, I knew that my assistant was a\ngood man, and that he would see to anything that\nturned up. \u201c \u2018That would suit me very well,\u2019 said I. \u2018And\nthe pay?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Is \u00a34 a week.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And the work?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Is purely nominal.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018What do you call purely nominal?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Well, you have to be in the of\ufb01ce, or at least\nin the building, the whole time. If you leave, you\nforfeit your whole position forever. The will is very\nclear upon that point. You don\u2019t comply with the\nconditions if you budge from the of\ufb01ce during that\ntime.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s only four hours a day, and I should not\nthink of leaving,\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018No excuse will avail,\u2019 said Mr. Duncan Ross;\n\u2018neither sickness nor business nor anything else.

It read in this\nfashion:\nThe Red-headed League\nis\nDissolved\nOctober 9, 1890. Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt an-\nnouncement and the rueful face behind it, until the\ncomical side of the affair so completely overtopped\nevery other consideration that we both burst out\ninto a roar of laughter. \u201cI cannot see that there is anything very\nfunny,\u201d cried our client, \ufb02ushing up to the roots\nof his \ufb02aming head. \u201cIf you can do nothing better\nthan laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Holmes, shoving him back into\nthe chair from which he had half risen. \u201cI really\nwouldn\u2019t miss your case for the world.

Then I called at the of\ufb01ces round, but none\nof them seemed to know anything about it. Fi-\nnally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant\nliving on the ground-\ufb02oor, and I asked him if he\ncould tell me what had become of the Red-headed\nLeague.

Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul\u2019s.\u2019\n\u201cI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got\nto that address it was a manufactory of arti\ufb01cial\nknee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of ei-\nther Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did you do then?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I\ntook the advice of my assistant. But he could not\nhelp me in any way. He could only say that if I\nwaited I should hear by post. But that was not\nquite good enough, Mr. Holmes.

Let\nus now explore the parts which lie behind it.\u201d\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we\nturned round the corner from the retired Saxe-\nCoburg Square presented as great a contrast to it\nas the front of a picture does to the back. It was\none of the main arteries which conveyed the traf-\n\ufb01c of the City to the north and west. The road-\nway was blocked with the immense stream of com-\nmerce \ufb02owing in a double tide inward and out-\nward, while the footpaths were black with the hur-\nrying swarm of pedestrians. It was dif\ufb01cult to re-\nalise as we looked at the line of \ufb01ne shops and\nstately business premises that they really abutted\non the other side upon the faded and stagnant\nsquare which we had just quitted. \u201cLet me see,\u201d said Holmes, standing at the cor-\nner and glancing along the line, \u201cI should like just\nto remember the order of the houses here. It is a\nhobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of Lon-\ndon. There is Mortimer\u2019s, the tobacconist, the little\nnewspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City\nand Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant,\nand McFarlane\u2019s carriage-building depot. That\ncarries us right on to the other block. And now,\nDoctor, we\u2019ve done our work, so it\u2019s time we\nhad some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee,\nand then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness\nand delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-\nheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums.\u201d\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being\nhimself not only a very capable performer but a\ncomposer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon\nhe sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect\nhappiness, gently waving his long, thin \ufb01ngers in\ntime to the music, while his gently smiling face\nand his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\nof Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relent-\nless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as\nit was possible to conceive. In his singular charac-\nter the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and\nhis extreme exactness and astuteness represented,\nas I have often thought, the reaction against the\npoetic and contemplative mood which occasion-\nally predominated in him. The swing of his nature\ntook him from extreme languor to devouring en-\nergy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly\nformidable as when, for days on end, he had been\nlounging in his armchair amid his improvisations\nand his black-letter editions. Then it was that the\nlust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise\nto the level of intuition, until those who were un-\nacquainted with his methods would look askance\nat him as on a man whose knowledge was not that\nof other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon\nso enwrapped in the music at St. James\u2019s Hall I\nfelt that an evil time might be coming upon those\nwhom he had set himself to hunt down."

I tried to puzzle it\nout, but gave it up in despair and set the matter\naside until night should bring an explanation. It was a quarter-past nine when I started from\nhome and made my way across the Park, and\nso through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\nhansoms were standing at the door, and as I en-\ntered the passage I heard the sound of voices from\nabove. On entering his room I found Holmes in an-\nimated conversation with two men, one of whom I\nrecognised as Peter Jones, the of\ufb01cial police agent,\nwhile the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man,\nwith a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\nfrock-coat. \u201cHa! Our party is complete,\u201d said Holmes,\nbuttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy\nhunting crop from the rack. \u201cWatson, I think you\nknow Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me intro-\nduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our\ncompanion in to-night\u2019s adventure.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you\nsee,\u201d said Jones in his consequential way. \u201cOur\nfriend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the\nrunning down.\u201d\n\u201cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the\nend of our chase,\u201d observed Mr. Merryweather\ngloomily."

It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in\nthat business of the Sholto murder and the Agra\ntreasure, he has been more nearly correct than the\nof\ufb01cial force.\u201d\n\u201cOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\u201d\nsaid the stranger with deference. \u201cStill, I confess\nthat I miss my rubber. It is the \ufb01rst Saturday night\nfor seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\nrubber.\u201d\n\u201cI think you will \ufb01nd,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes,\n\u201cthat you will play for a higher stake to-night than\nyou have ever done yet, and that the play will be\nmore exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the\nstake will be some \u00a330,000; and for you, Jones, it\nwill be the man upon whom you wish to lay your\nhands.\u201d\n\u201cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and\nforger. He\u2019s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but\nhe is at the head of his profession, and I would\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any crim-\ninal in London. He\u2019s a remarkable man, is young\nJohn Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and\nhe himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain\nis as cunning as his \ufb01ngers, and though we meet\nsigns of him at every turn, we never know where\nto \ufb01nd the man himself. He\u2019ll crack a crib in Scot-\nland one week, and be raising money to build an\norphanage in Cornwall the next. I\u2019ve been on his\ntrack for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\u201d\n\u201cI hope that I may have the pleasure of intro-\nducing you to-night. I\u2019ve had one or two little\nturns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\nyou that he is at the head of his profession. It is\npast ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the \ufb01rst hansom, Watson and\nI will follow in the second.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative\nduring the long drive and lay back in the cab hum-\nming the tunes which he had heard in the after-\nnoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth\nof gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington\nStreet. \u201cWe are close there now,\u201d my friend remarked. \u201cThis fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and\npersonally interested in the matter. I thought it as\nwell to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad\nfellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profes-\nsion. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as\na bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets\nhis claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are\nwaiting for us.\u201d\n144\nThe Red-Headed League\nWe had reached the same crowded thorough-\nfare in which we had found ourselves in the morn-\ning."

Within there was a small cor-\nridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a \ufb02ight of\nwinding stone steps, which terminated at another\nformidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to\nlight a lantern, and then conducted us down a\ndark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after open-\ning a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which\nwas piled all round with crates and massive boxes. \u201cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\u201d\nHolmes remarked as he held up the lantern and\ngazed about him. \u201cNor from below,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather,\nstriking his stick upon the \ufb02ags which lined the\n\ufb02oor. \u201cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\u201d he\nremarked, looking up in surprise. \u201cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\u201d\nsaid Holmes severely. \u201cYou have already imper-\nilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I\nbeg that you would have the goodness to sit down\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\u201d\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself\nupon a crate, with a very injured expression upon\nhis face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\nthe \ufb02oor and, with the lantern and a magnifying\nlens, began to examine minutely the cracks be-\ntween the stones. A few seconds suf\ufb01ced to satisfy\nhim, for he sprang to his feet again and put his\nglass in his pocket. \u201cWe have at least an hour before us,\u201d he re-\nmarked, \u201cfor they can hardly take any steps until\nthe good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\nwill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their\nwork the longer time they will have for their es-\ncape. We are at present, Doctor\u2014as no doubt you\nhave divined\u2014in the cellar of the City branch of\none of the principal London banks. Mr. Merry-\nweather is the chairman of directors, and he will\nexplain to you that there are reasons why the more\ndaring criminals of London should take a consid-\nerable interest in this cellar at present.\u201d\n\u201cIt is our French gold,\u201d whispered the director. \u201cWe have had several warnings that an attempt\nmight be made upon it.\u201d\n\u201cYour French gold?\u201d\n\u201cYes. We had occasion some months ago to\nstrengthen our resources and borrowed for that\npurpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occa-\nsion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying\nin our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains\n2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present\nthan is usually kept in a single branch of\ufb01ce, and\nthe directors have had misgivings upon the sub-\nject.\u201d\n\u201cWhich were very well justi\ufb01ed,\u201d observed\nHolmes. \u201cAnd now it is time that we arranged our\nlittle plans."

I had brought a pack of cards\nin my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a par-\ntie carr\u00b4ee, you might have your rubber after all. But\nI see that the enemy\u2019s preparations have gone so\nfar that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,\n\ufb01rst of all, we must choose our positions.

The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\nthe light was still there, ready to \ufb02ash out at a mo-\nment\u2019s notice.

From comparing notes\nafterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it\nappeared to me that the night must have almost\ngone and the dawn be breaking above us. My\nlimbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change\nmy position; yet my nerves were worked up to the\n145\nThe Red-Headed League\nhighest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so\nacute that I could not only hear the gentle breath-\ning of my companions, but I could distinguish the\ndeeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from\nthe thin, sighing note of the bank director. From\nmy position I could look over the case in the di-\nrection of the \ufb02oor. Suddenly my eyes caught the\nglint of a light. At \ufb01rst it was but a lurid spark upon the stone\npavement. Then it lengthened out until it became\na yellow line, and then, without any warning or\nsound, a gash seemed to open and a hand ap-\npeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt\nabout in the centre of the little area of light. For a\nminute or more the hand, with its writhing \ufb01ngers,\nprotruded out of the \ufb02oor."

Its disappearance, however, was but momen-\ntary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the\nbroad, white stones turned over upon its side and\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed\nthe light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a\nclean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about\nit, and then, with a hand on either side of the aper-\nture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, un-\ntil one knee rested upon the edge. In another in-\nstant he stood at the side of the hole and was haul-\ning after him a companion, lithe and small like\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red\nhair. \u201cIt\u2019s all clear,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHave you the\nchisel and the bags?

It was a curious way of managing it,\nbut, really, it would be dif\ufb01cult to suggest a bet-\nter. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\u2019s\ningenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\u2019s\nhair. The \u00a34 a week was a lure which must draw\nhim, and what was it to them, who were playing\nfor thousands? They put in the advertisement, one\nrogue has the temporary of\ufb01ce, the other rogue in-\ncites the man to apply for it, and together they\nmanage to secure his absence every morning in the\nweek.

He was doing something in the\ncellar\u2014something which took many hours a day\nfor months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running\na tunnel to some other building. \u201cSo far I had got when we went to visit the\nscene of action. I surprised you by beating upon\nthe pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining\nwhether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as\nI hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had\nsome skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon\neach other before. I hardly looked at his face.

The husband was a teetotaler, there\nwas no other woman, and the conduct complained\nof was that he had drifted into the habit of wind-\ning up every meal by taking out his false teeth and\nhurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is\nnot an action likely to occur to the imagination of\nthe average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doc-\ntor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you\nin your example.\u201d\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a\ngreat amethyst in the centre of the lid.

They are important, you\nunderstand, without being interesting. Indeed, I\nhave found that it is usually in unimportant mat-\nters that there is a \ufb01eld for the observation, and for\nthe quick analysis of cause and effect which gives\nthe charm to an investigation. The larger crimes\nare apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime\nthe more obvious, as a rule, is the motive.

Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as\nmuch for me."

Again a startled look came over the some-\nwhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \u201cYes,\nI did bang out of the house,\u201d she said, \u201cfor it\nmade me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.\nWindibank\u2014that is, my father\u2014took it all. He\nwould not go to the police, and he would not go\nto you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and\nkept on saying that there was no harm done, it\nmade me mad, and I just on with my things and\ncame right away to you.\u201d\n\u201cYour father,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyour stepfather,\nsurely, since the name is different.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my stepfather. I call him father, though\nit sounds funny, too, for he is only \ufb01ve years and\ntwo months older than myself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your mother is alive?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\u2019t\nbest pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again\nso soon after father\u2019s death, and a man who was\nnearly \ufb01fteen years younger than herself. Father\nwas a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and\nhe left a tidy business behind him, which mother\ncarried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when\nMr. Windibank came he made her sell the busi-\nness, for he was very superior, being a traveller in\nwines. They got \u00a34700 for the goodwill and in-\nterest, which wasn\u2019t near as much as father could\nhave got if he had been alive.\u201d\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impa-\ntient under this rambling and inconsequential nar-\nrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\nthe greatest concentration of attention. \u201cYour own little income,\u201d he asked, \u201cdoes it\ncome out of the business?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left\nme by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New\nZealand stock, paying 4 1\n2 per cent. Two thousand\n\ufb01ve hundred pounds was the amount, but I can\nonly touch the interest.\u201d\n\u201cYou interest me extremely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAnd since you draw so large a sum as a hun-\ndred a year, with what you earn into the bargain,\nyou no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in\nevery way. I believe that a single lady can get on\nvery nicely upon an income of about \u00a360.\u201d\n\u201cI could do with much less than that, Mr.\nHolmes, but you understand that as long as I live\nat home I don\u2019t wish to be a burden to them, and\nso they have the use of the money just while I am\nstaying with them. Of course, that is only just for\nthe time."

Mr. Windibank did not\nwish us to go. He never did wish us to go any-\nwhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so\nmuch as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this\ntime I was set on going, and I would go; for what\nright had he to prevent? He said the folk were not\n\ufb01t for us to know, when all father\u2019s friends were\nto be there. And he said that I had nothing \ufb01t to\nwear, when I had my purple plush that I had never\nso much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when\nnothing else would do, he went off to France upon\nthe business of the \ufb01rm, but we went, mother and\nI, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman,\nand it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat when Mr.\nWindibank came back from France he was very an-\nnoyed at your having gone to the ball.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, he was very good about it. He\nlaughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders,\nand said there was no use denying anything to a\nwoman, for she would have her way.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Then at the gas\ufb01tters\u2019 ball you met, as\nI understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer An-\ngel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called\nnext day to ask if we had got home all safe, and af-\nter that we met him\u2014that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I\nmet him twice for walks, but after that father came\nback again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come\nto the house any more.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know father didn\u2019t like anything of\nthe sort. He wouldn\u2019t have any visitors if he could\nhelp it, and he used to say that a woman should be\nhappy in her own family circle. But then, as I used\nto say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to\nbegin with, and I had not got mine yet.\u201d\n\u201cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he\nmake no attempt to see you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, father was going off to France again in\na week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would\nbe safer and better not to see each other until he\nhad gone."

Can you remem-\nber any other little things about Mr. Hosmer An-\ngel?\u201d\n\u201cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He\nwould rather walk with me in the evening than\nin the daylight, for he said that he hated to be con-\nspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\u2019d had the quinsy\nand swollen glands when he was young, he told\nme, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a\nhesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was\nalways well dressed, very neat and plain, but his\neyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore\ntinted glasses against the glare.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\nand\nwhat\nhappened\nwhen\nMr.\nWindibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again\nand proposed that we should marry before father\ncame back. He was in dreadful earnest and made\nme swear, with my hands on the Testament, that\nwhatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\nand that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was\nall in his favour from the \ufb01rst and was even fonder\nof him than I was. Then, when they talked of mar-\nrying within the week, I began to ask about fa-\nther; but they both said never to mind about fa-\nther, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother\n153\nA Case of Identity\nsaid she would make it all right with him. I didn\u2019t\nquite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that\nI should ask his leave, as he was only a few years\nolder than me; but I didn\u2019t want to do anything on\nthe sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\ncompany has its French of\ufb01ces, but the letter came\nback to me on the very morning of the wedding.\u201d\n\u201cIt missed him, then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir; for he had started to England just be-\nfore it arrived.\u201d\n\u201cHa!"

It was to be at St.\nSaviour\u2019s, near King\u2019s Cross, and we were to have\nbreakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hos-\nmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were\ntwo of us he put us both into it and stepped him-\nself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be\nthe only other cab in the street. We got to the\nchurch \ufb01rst, and when the four-wheeler drove up\nwe waited for him to step out, but he never did,\nand when the cabman got down from the box and\nlooked there was no one there! The cabman said\nthat he could not imagine what had become of\nhim, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never\nseen or heard anything since then to throw any\nlight upon what became of him.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have been very shame-\nfully treated,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to\nleave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to\nme that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and\nthat even if something quite unforeseen occurred\nto separate us, I was always to remember that I\nwas pledged to him, and that he would claim his\npledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for\na wedding-morning, but what has happened since\ngives a meaning to it.\u201d\n\u201cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is,\nthen, that some unforeseen catastrophe has oc-\ncurred to him?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some dan-\nger, or else he would not have talked so.

Did you tell him?\u201d\n\u201cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that\nsomething had happened, and that I should hear\nof Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could\nanyone have in bringing me to the doors of the\nchurch, and then leaving me? Now, if he had bor-\nrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\nmy money settled on him, there might be some\nreason, but Hosmer was very independent about\nmoney and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why\ncould he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to\nthink of it, and I can\u2019t sleep a wink at night.\u201d She\npulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and\nbegan to sob heavily into it. \u201cI shall glance into the case for you,\u201d said\nHolmes, rising, \u201cand I have no doubt that we shall\nreach some de\ufb01nite result."

Her boots I didn\u2019t\nobserve. She had small round, hanging gold ear-\nrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do\nin a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly to-\ngether and chuckled. \u201c\u2019Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along\nwonderfully. You have really done very well in-\ndeed. It is true that you have missed everything\nof importance, but you have hit upon the method,\nand you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust\nto general impressions, my boy, but concentrate\nyourself upon details. My \ufb01rst glance is always\nat a woman\u2019s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps bet-\nter \ufb01rst to take the knee of the trouser. As you\nobserve, this woman had plush upon her sleeves,\nwhich is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the\ntypewritist presses against the table, was beauti-\nfully de\ufb01ned. The sewing-machine, of the hand\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left\narm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb,\ninstead of being right across the broadest part, as\nthis was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing\nthe dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I\nventured a remark upon short sight and typewrit-\ning, which seemed to surprise her.\u201d\n\u201cIt surprised me.\u201d\n\u201cBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much\nsurprised and interested on glancing down to ob-\nserve that, though the boots which she was wear-\ning were not unlike each other, they were really\nodd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-\ncap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned\nonly in the two lower buttons out of \ufb01ve, and the\nother at the \ufb01rst, third, and \ufb01fth. Now, when you\nsee that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed,\nhas come away from home with odd boots, half-\nbuttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she\ncame away in a hurry.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what else?\u201d I asked, keenly interested, as\nI always was, by my friend\u2019s incisive reasoning. \u201cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note\nbefore leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the\nfore\ufb01nger, but you did not apparently see that both\nglove and \ufb01nger were stained with violet ink. She\nhad written in a hurry and dipped her pen too\ndeep. It must have been this morning, or the mark\nwould not remain clear upon the \ufb01nger. All this is\namusing, though rather elementary, but I must go\nback to business, Watson.

Was dressed, when\nlast seen, in black frock-coat faced with\nsilk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain,\nand grey Harris tweed trousers, with\nbrown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an\nof\ufb01ce in Leadenhall Street. Anybody\nbringing\u2014\u201d\n155\nA Case of Identity\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAs to the let-\nters,\u201d he continued, glancing over them, \u201cthey are\nvery commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to\nMr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There\nis one remarkable point, however, which will no\ndoubt strike you.\u201d\n\u201cThey are typewritten,\u201d I remarked. \u201cNot only that, but the signature is typewrit-\nten. Look at the neat little \u2018Hosmer Angel\u2019 at the\nbottom. There is a date, you see, but no super-\nscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather\nvague. The point about the signature is very sug-\ngestive\u2014in fact, we may call it conclusive.\u201d\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see\nhow strongly it bears upon the case?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot say that I do unless it were that he\nwished to be able to deny his signature if an ac-\ntion for breach of promise were instituted.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall\nwrite two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a \ufb01rm in the City, the other is to the\nyoung lady\u2019s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking\nhim whether he could meet us here at six o\u2019clock\ntomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should\ndo business with the male relatives. And now,\nDoctor, we can do nothing until the answers to\nthose letters come, so we may put our little prob-\nlem upon the shelf for the interim.\u201d\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my\nfriend\u2019s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordi-\nnary energy in action that I felt that he must have\nsome solid grounds for the assured and easy de-\nmeanour with which he treated the singular mys-\ntery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of\nthe King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photo-\ngraph; but when I looked back to the weird busi-\nness of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary cir-\ncumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I\nfelt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which\nhe could not unravel. I left him then, still puf\ufb01ng at his black clay\npipe, with the conviction that when I came again\non the next evening I would \ufb01nd that he held in\nhis hands all the clues which would lead up to the\nidentity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss\nMary Sutherland.

I found Sherlock Holmes alone, how-\never, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled\nup in the recesses of his armchair.

I am afraid that I am a little late, but I\nam not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry\nthat Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this\nlittle matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\nlinen of the sort in public.

Unless they are quite\nnew, no two of them write exactly alike. Some let-\nters get more worn than others, and some wear\nonly on one side. Now, you remark in this note\nof yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there\nis some little slurring over of the \u2018e,\u2019 and a slight\ndefect in the tail of the \u2018r.\u2019 There are fourteen other\ncharacteristics, but those are the more obvious.\u201d\n\u201cWe do all our correspondence with this ma-\nchine at the of\ufb01ce, and no doubt it is a little worn,\u201d\nour visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes\nwith his bright little eyes. \u201cAnd now I will show you what is really a very\ninteresting study, Mr. Windibank,\u201d Holmes contin-\nued. \u201cI think of writing another little monograph\nsome of these days on the typewriter and its rela-\ntion to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted\nsome little attention. I have here four letters which\npurport to come from the missing man. They are\nall typewritten. In each case, not only are the \u2018e\u2019s\u2019\nslurred and the \u2018r\u2019s\u2019 tailless, but you will observe,\nif you care to use my magnifying lens, that the\nfourteen other characteristics to which I have al-\nluded are there as well.\u201d\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and\npicked up his hat. \u201cI cannot waste time over this\nsort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\ncan catch the man, catch him, and let me know\nwhen you have done it.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Holmes, stepping over and\nturning the key in the door. \u201cI let you know, then,\nthat I have caught him!\u201d\n\u201cWhat! where?\u201d shouted Mr. Windibank, turn-\ning white to his lips and glancing about him like a\nrat in a trap. \u201cOh, it won\u2019t do\u2014really it won\u2019t,\u201d said Holmes\nsuavely. \u201cThere is no possible getting out of it, Mr.\nWindibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was\na very bad compliment when you said that it was\nimpossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\u2019s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.\u201d\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a\nghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. \u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s not actionable,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI am very much afraid that it is not. But be-\ntween ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and\nsel\ufb01sh and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever\ncame before me. Now, let me just run over the\ncourse of events, and you will contradict me if I go\nwrong.\u201d\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his\nhead sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly\ncrushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of\nthe mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands\nin his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as\nit seemed, than to us."

It was a consid-\nerable sum, for people in their position, and the\nloss of it would have made a serious difference. It\nwas worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter\nwas of a good, amiable disposition, but affection-\nate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was\nevident that with her fair personal advantages, and\nher little income, she would not be allowed to re-\nmain single long. Now her marriage would mean,\nof course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\ndoes her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes\nthe obvious course of keeping her at home and\nforbidding her to seek the company of people of\nher own age. But soon he found that that would\nnot answer forever. She became restive, insisted\nupon her rights, and \ufb01nally announced her posi-\ntive intention of going to a certain ball. What does\nher clever stepfather do then? He conceives an\nidea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with\ntinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache\nand a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice\ninto an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on\naccount of the girl\u2019s short sight, he appears as Mr.\nHosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by mak-\ning love himself.\u201d\n\u201cIt was only a joke at \ufb01rst,\u201d groaned our visi-\ntor. \u201cWe never thought that she would have been\nso carried away.\u201d\n\u201cVery likely not. However that may be, the\nyoung lady was very decidedly carried away, and,\nhaving quite made up her mind that her step-\nfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery\nnever for an instant entered her mind. She was\n\ufb02attered by the gentleman\u2019s attentions, and the\neffect was increased by the loudly expressed ad-\nmiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began\nto call, for it was obvious that the matter should\n157\nbe pushed as far as it would go if a real effect\nwere to be produced. There were meetings, and\nan engagement, which would \ufb01nally secure the\ngirl\u2019s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather\ncumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring\nthe business to an end in such a dramatic manner\nthat it would leave a permanent impression upon\nthe young lady\u2019s mind and prevent her from look-\ning upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of \ufb01delity exacted upon a Tes-\ntament, and hence also the allusions to a possibil-\nity of something happening on the very morning\nof the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\nSutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and\nso uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to\ncome, at any rate, she would not listen to another\nman."

Then the fact that the two men were never\ntogether, but that the one always appeared when\nthe other was away, was suggestive. So were the\ntinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both\nhinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all con\ufb01rmed by his pecu-\nliar action in typewriting his signature, which, of\ncourse, inferred that his handwriting was so famil-\niar to her that she would recognise even the small-\nest sample of it.

I shall take\nnothing for granted until I have the opportunity of\nlooking personally into it. I will explain the state\nof things to you, as far as I have been able to un-\nderstand it, in a very few words. \u201cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very\nfar from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest\nlanded proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner,\nwho made his money in Australia and returned\nsome years ago to the old country. One of the\nfarms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let\nto Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-\nAustralian. The men had known each other in the\ncolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when\nthey came to settle down they should do so as\nnear each other as possible. Turner was apparently\nthe richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant\nbut still remained, it seems, upon terms of per-\nfect equality, as they were frequently together. Mc-\nCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner\nhad an only daughter of the same age, but nei-\nther of them had wives living. They appear to\nhave avoided the society of the neighbouring En-\nglish families and to have led retired lives, though\nboth the McCarthys were fond of sport and were\nfrequently seen at the race-meetings of the neigh-\nbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\u2014a man\nand a girl. Turner had a considerable household,\nsome half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I\nhave been able to gather about the families. Now\nfor the facts. \u201cOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, Mc-\nCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in\nthe afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe\nPool, which is a small lake formed by the spread-\ning out of the stream which runs down the\nBoscombe Valley. He had been out with his\nserving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had\ntold the man that he must hurry, as he had an ap-\npointment of importance to keep at three."

One was an\nold woman, whose name is not mentioned, and\nthe other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in\nthe employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses\ndepose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The\ngame-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his\nseeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun\nunder his arm. To the best of his belief, the father\nwas actually in sight at the time, and the son was\nfollowing him. He thought no more of the matter\nuntil he heard in the evening of the tragedy that\nhad occurred. \u201cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time\nwhen William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost\nsight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly\nwooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of\nreeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience\nMoran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper\nof the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the\nwoods picking \ufb02owers. She states that while she\nwas there she saw, at the border of the wood and\nclose by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and\nthat they appeared to be having a violent quar-\nrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very\nstrong language to his son, and she saw the lat-\nter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She\nwas so frightened by their violence that she ran\naway and told her mother when she reached home\nthat she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling\nnear Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that\nthey were going to \ufb01ght. She had hardly said the\nwords when young Mr. McCarthy came running\nup to the lodge to say that he had found his fa-\nther dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\nof the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, with-\nout either his gun or his hat, and his right hand\nand sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh\nblood. On following him they found the dead\nbody stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of\nsome heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were\nsuch as might very well have been in\ufb02icted by the\nbutt-end of his son\u2019s gun, which was found lying\non the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly\narrested, and a verdict of \u2018wilful murder\u2019 having\nbeen returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was\non Wednesday brought before the magistrates at\nRoss, who have referred the case to the next As-\nsizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they\ncame out before the coroner and the police-court.\u201d\n\u201cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,\u201d\nI remarked."

I\nthought that he was delirious. \u201cThe Coroner: What was the point upon\nwhich you and your father had this \ufb01nal\nquarrel? \u201cWitness: I should prefer not to answer. \u201cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press\nit. \u201cWitness: It is really impossible for me to\ntell you.

Yet I\nhave a vague impression that as I ran for-\nward something lay upon the ground to the\nleft of me. It seemed to me to be something\ngrey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a\nplaid perhaps. When I rose from my father\nI looked round for it, but it was gone. \u201c \u2018Do you mean that it disappeared before\nyou went for help?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Yes, it was gone.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You cannot say what it was?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018No, I had a feeling something was there.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018How far from the body?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018A dozen yards or so.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And how far from the edge of the wood?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018About the same.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Then if it was removed it was while you\nwere within a dozen yards of it?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Yes, but with my back towards it.\u2019\n\u201cThis concluded the examination of the\nwitness.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d said I as I glanced down the column, \u201cthat\nthe coroner in his concluding remarks was rather\nsevere upon young McCarthy. He calls attention,\nand with reason, to the discrepancy about his fa-\nther having signalled to him before seeing him,\nalso to his refusal to give details of his conversa-\ntion with his father, and his singular account of his\nfather\u2019s dying words. They are all, as he remarks,\nvery much against the son.\u201d\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched\nhimself out upon the cushioned seat. \u201cBoth you\nand the coroner have been at some pains,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cto single out the very strongest points in the\nyoung man\u2019s favour. Don\u2019t you see that you alter-\nnately give him credit for having too much imagi-\nnation and too little? Too little, if he could not in-\nvent a cause of quarrel which would give him the\nsympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from\nhis own inner consciousness anything so outr\u00b4e as\na dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\nvanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case\nfrom the point of view that what this young man\nsays is true, and we shall see whither that hypoth-\nesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Pe-\ntrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case\nuntil we are on the scene of action. We lunch at\nSwindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty\nminutes.\u201d\nIt was nearly four o\u2019clock when we at last, af-\nter passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley,\nand over the broad gleaming Severn, found our-\nselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A\nlean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was\nwaiting for us upon the platform."

Still, of course, one can\u2019t refuse a lady,\nand such a very positive one, too. She has heard\nof you, and would have your opinion, though I\nrepeatedly told her that there was nothing which\nyou could do which I had not already done. Why,\nbless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\u201d\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into\nthe room one of the most lovely young women that\nI have ever seen in my life.

I have\ndriven down to tell you so. I know that James\ndidn\u2019t do it. I know it, and I want you to start\nupon your work knowing it, too. Never let your-\nself doubt upon that point. We have known each\nother since we were little children, and I know his\nfaults as no one else does; but he is too tender-\nhearted to hurt a \ufb02y. Such a charge is absurd to\nanyone who really knows him.\u201d\n\u201cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\u201d said\nSherlock Holmes. \u201cYou may rely upon my doing\nall that I can.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have read the evidence.

Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his\nfather, I am sure that the reason why he would not\nspeak about it to the coroner was because I was\nconcerned in it.\u201d\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James\nand his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should\nbe a marriage between us. James and I have al-\nways loved each other as brother and sister; but of\ncourse he is young and has seen very little of life\nyet, and\u2014and\u2014well, he naturally did not wish to\ndo anything like that yet.

Poor father has\nnever been strong for years back, but this has bro-\nken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,\nand Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his\nnervous system is shattered.

You have been of\nmaterial assistance to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou will tell me if you have any news to-\nmorrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to\nsee James.

Good-bye, and\nGod help you in your undertaking.\u201d She hurried\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered,\nand we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off\ndown the street. \u201cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\u201d said Lestrade\nwith dignity after a few minutes\u2019 silence. \u201cWhy\nshould you raise up hopes which you are bound\nto disappoint?

Watson, I fear that you will\n\ufb01nd it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple\nof hours.\u201d\nI walked down to the station with them, and\nthen wandered through the streets of the little\ntown, \ufb01nally returning to the hotel, where I lay\nupon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a\nyellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story\nwas so thin, however, when compared to the deep\nmystery through which we were groping, and I\nfound my attention wander so continually from\nthe action to the fact, that I at last \ufb02ung it across the\nroom and gave myself up entirely to a considera-\ntion of the events of the day. Supposing that this\nunhappy young man\u2019s story were absolutely true,\nthen what hellish thing, what absolutely unfore-\nseen and extraordinary calamity could have oc-\ncurred between the time when he parted from his\nfather, and the moment when, drawn back by his\nscreams, he rushed into the glade? It was some-\nthing terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might\nnot the nature of the injuries reveal something to\nmy medical instincts? I rang the bell and called\nfor the weekly county paper, which contained a\nverbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\u2019s\ndeposition it was stated that the posterior third of\nthe left parietal bone and the left half of the occip-\nital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from\na blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own\nhead. Clearly such a blow must have been struck\nfrom behind. That was to some extent in favour of\nthe accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face\nto face with his father. Still, it did not go for very\nmuch, for the older man might have turned his\nback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth\nwhile to call Holmes\u2019 attention to it. Then there\nwas the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What\ncould that mean? It could not be delirium. A man\ndying from a sudden blow does not commonly be-\ncome delirious. No, it was more likely to be an\nattempt to explain how he met his fate. But what\ncould it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to \ufb01nd\nsome possible explanation. And then the incident\nof the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that\nwere true the murderer must have dropped some\npart of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his\n\ufb02ight, and must have had the hardihood to return\nand to carry it away at the instant when the son\nwas kneeling with his back turned not a dozen\npaces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improb-\nabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at\nLestrade\u2019s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 insight that I could not lose hope\nas long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his\nconviction of young McCarthy\u2019s innocence."

On the other hand, a man should be at his very\nbest and keenest for such nice work as that, and I\ndid not wish to do it when fagged by a long jour-\nney. I have seen young McCarthy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did you learn from him?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cCould he throw no light?\u201d\n\u201cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time\nthat he knew who had done it and was screen-\ning him or her, but I am convinced now that he\nis as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very\nquick-witted youth, though comely to look at and,\nI should think, sound at heart.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot admire his taste,\u201d I remarked, \u201cif it is\nindeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with\nso charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\u201d\n\u201cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This\nfellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but\nsome two years ago, when he was only a lad, and\nbefore he really knew her, for she had been away\n\ufb01ve years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot\ndo but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol\nand marry her at a registry of\ufb01ce? No one knows a\nword of the matter, but you can imagine how mad-\ndening it must be to him to be upbraided for not\ndoing what he would give his very eyes to do, but\nwhat he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was\nsheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw\nhis hands up into the air when his father, at their\nlast interview, was goading him on to propose to\nMiss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means\nof supporting himself, and his father, who was by\nall accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\nhim over utterly had he known the truth. It was\nwith his barmaid wife that he had spent the last\nthree days in Bristol, and his father did not know\nwhere he was. Mark that point. It is of impor-\ntance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the\n166\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\nbarmaid, \ufb01nding from the papers that he is in se-\nrious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown\nhim over utterly and has written to him to say that\nshe has a husband already in the Bermuda Dock-\nyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young\nMcCarthy for all that he has suffered.\u201d\n\u201cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\u201d\n\u201cAh! who? I would call your attention very\nparticularly to two points. One is that the mur-\ndered man had an appointment with someone at\nthe pool, and that the someone could not have\nbeen his son, for his son was away, and he did not\nknow when he would return."

This business has had\na very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend\nof McCarthy\u2019s, and, I may add, a great benefactor\nto him, for I have learned that he gave him Hather-\nley Farm rent free.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed!

Does it not strike you as a little singu-\nlar that this McCarthy, who appears to have had\nlittle of his own, and to have been under such\nobligations to Turner, should still talk of marry-\ning his son to Turner\u2019s daughter, who is, presum-\nably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very\ncocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a\nproposal and all else would follow? It is the more\nstrange, since we know that Turner himself was\naverse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?\u201d\n\u201cWe have got to the deductions and the infer-\nences,\u201d said Lestrade, winking at me. \u201cI \ufb01nd it\nhard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without \ufb02y-\ning away after theories and fancies.\u201d\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Holmes demurely; \u201cyou\ndo \ufb01nd it very hard to tackle the facts.\u201d\n\u201cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you\nseem to \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to get hold of,\u201d replied\nLestrade with some warmth. \u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat McCarthy senior met his death from Mc-\nCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary\nare the merest moonshine.\u201d\n\u201cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\u201d\nsaid Holmes, laughing. \u201cBut I am very much mis-\ntaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\nthat\nis\nit.\u201d\nIt\nwas\na\nwidespread,\ncomfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-\nroofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\nthe grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smoke-\nless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as\nthough the weight of this horror still lay heavy\nupon it.

Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he\nwas hot upon such a scent as this. Men who\nhad only known the quiet thinker and logician of\nBaker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face \ufb02ushed and darkened. His brows were\ndrawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes\nshone out from beneath them with a steely glit-\nter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders\nbowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood\nout like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His\nnostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust\nfor the chase, and his mind was so absolutely con-\ncentrated upon the matter before him that a ques-\ntion or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at\nthe most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in\nreply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along\nthe track which ran through the meadows, and so\nby way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It\nwas damp, marshy ground, as is all that district,\nand there were marks of many feet, both upon the\npath and amid the short grass which bounded it\non either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry\non, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite\na little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I\n167\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\nwalked behind him, the detective indifferent and\ncontemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that ev-\nery one of his actions was directed towards a de\ufb01-\nnite end. The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt\nsheet of water some \ufb01fty yards across, is situ-\nated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm\nand the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther\nside we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which\nmarked the site of the rich landowner\u2019s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew\nvery thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden\ngrass twenty paces across between the edge of the\ntrees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade\nshowed us the exact spot at which the body had\nbeen found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,\nthat I could plainly see the traces which had been\nleft by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes,\nas I could see by his eager face and peering eyes,\nvery many other things were to be read upon the\ntrampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is\npicking up a scent, and then turned upon my com-\npanion. \u201cWhat did you go into the pool for?\u201d he asked. \u201cI \ufb01shed about with a rake.

There\nare several other indications, but these may be\nenough to aid us in our search.\u201d\nLestrade laughed. \u201cI am afraid that I am still a\nsceptic,\u201d he said. \u201cTheories are all very well, but\nwe have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\u201d\n\u201cNous verrons,\u201d answered Holmes calmly. \u201cYou work your own method, and I shall work\nmine.

This is not such a populous neighbourhood.\u201d\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am a prac-\ntical man,\u201d he said, \u201cand I really cannot undertake\nto go about the country looking for a left-handed\ngentleman with a game leg. I should become the\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cI have given\nyou the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-\nbye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\u201d\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to\nour hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a\npained expression upon his face, as one who \ufb01nds\nhimself in a perplexing position. \u201cLook here, Watson,\u201d he said when the cloth\nwas cleared \u201cjust sit down in this chair and let me\npreach to you for a little. I don\u2019t know quite what\nto do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar\nand let me expound.\u201d\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\n\u201cWell, now, in considering this case there\nare two points about young McCarthy\u2019s narrative\nwhich struck us both instantly, although they im-\npressed me in his favour and you against him. One\nwas the fact that his father should, according to his\naccount, cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before seeing him. The other\nwas his singular dying reference to a rat. He mum-\nbled several words, you understand, but that was\nall that caught the son\u2019s ear. Now from this double\npoint our research must commence, and we will\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is ab-\nsolutely true.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of this \u2018Cooee!\u2019 then?\u201d\n\u201cWell, obviously it could not have been meant\nfor the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bris-\ntol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The \u2018Cooee!\u2019\nwas meant to attract the attention\nof whoever it was that he had the appointment\nwith. But \u2018Cooee\u2019 is a distinctly Australian cry, and\none which is used between Australians."

So and so, of Ballarat.\u201d\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had nar-\nrowed the \ufb01eld down considerably. The possession\nof a grey garment was a third point which, grant-\ning the son\u2019s statement to be correct, was a cer-\ntainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness\nto the de\ufb01nite conception of an Australian from\nBallarat with a grey cloak.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd one who was at home in the district, for\nthe pool can only be approached by the farm or by\nthe estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\n\u201cThen comes our expedition of to-day.

It is founded upon the\nobservation of tri\ufb02es.\u201d\n\u201cHis height I know that you might roughly\njudge from the length of his stride. His boots, too,\nmight be told from their traces.\u201d\n\u201cYes, they were peculiar boots.\u201d\n\u201cBut his lameness?\u201d\n\u201cThe impression of his right foot was always\nless distinct than his left. He put less weight upon\nit. Why? Because he limped\u2014he was lame.\u201d\n\u201cBut his left-handedness.\u201d\n\u201cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the\ninjury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind,\nand yet was upon the left side. Now, how can\nthat be unless it were by a left-handed man? He\nhad stood behind that tree during the interview\nbetween the father and son. He had even smoked\nthere. I found the ash of a cigar, which my spe-\ncial knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pro-\nnounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know,\ndevoted some attention to this, and written a little\nmonograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties\nof pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found\nthe ash, I then looked round and discovered the\nstump among the moss where he had tossed it. It\n169\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\nwas an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled\nin Rotterdam.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the cigar-holder?\u201d\n\u201cI could see that the end had not been in his\nmouth. Therefore he used a holder."

I\npromise you that I shall not use it unless it is ab-\nsolutely needed.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s as well,\u201d said the old man; \u201cit\u2019s a question\nwhether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters\nlittle to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the\nshock. And now I will make the thing clear to\nyou; it has been a long time in the acting, but will\nnot take me long to tell. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep\nyou out of the clutches of such a man as he. His\ngrip has been upon me these twenty years, and he\nhas blasted my life. I\u2019ll tell you \ufb01rst how I came to\nbe in his power. \u201cIt was in the early \u201960\u2019s at the diggings. I\nwas a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless,\nready to turn my hand at anything; I got among\nbad companions, took to drink, had no luck with\nmy claim, took to the bush, and in a word became\nwhat you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life\nof it, sticking up a station from time to time, or\nstopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,\nand our party is still remembered in the colony as\nthe Ballarat Gang. \u201cOne day a gold convoy came down from Bal-\nlarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and\nattacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,\nso it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their\nsaddles at the \ufb01rst volley. Three of our boys were\nkilled, however, before we got the swag. I put my\npistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was\nthis very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I\nhad shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw\nhis wicked little eyes \ufb01xed on my face, as though\nto remember every feature. We got away with the\n170\ngold, became wealthy men, and made our way\nover to England without being suspected. There\nI parted from my old pals and determined to set-\ntle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought\nthis estate, which chanced to be in the market, and\nI set myself to do a little good with my money, to\nmake up for the way in which I had earned it. I\nmarried, too, and though my wife died young she\nleft me my dear little Alice. Even when she was\njust a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down\nthe right path as nothing else had ever done. In\na word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best\nto make up for the past. All was going well when\nMcCarthy laid his grip upon me."

There\nwas no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn\nwhere I would, there was his cunning, grinning\nface at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up,\nfor he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing\nmy past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he\nmust have, and whatever it was I gave him with-\nout question, land, money, houses, until at last he\nasked a thing which I could not give. He asked for\nAlice. \u201cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had\nmy girl, and as I was known to be in weak health,\nit seemed a \ufb01ne stroke to him that his lad should\nstep into the whole property.

But as I\nlistened to his talk all that was black and bitter in\nme seemed to come uppermost. He was urging\nhis son to marry my daughter with as little regard\nfor what she might think as if she were a slut from\noff the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and\nall that I held most dear should be in the power of\nsuch a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I\nwas already a dying and a desperate man. Though\nclear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that\nmy own fate was sealed. But my memory and my\ngirl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that\nfoul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it\nagain. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of\nmartyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should\nbe entangled in the same meshes which held me\nwas more than I could suffer. I struck him down\nwith no more compunction than if he had been\nsome foul and venomous beast."

All these I may\nsketch out at some future date, but none of them\npresent such singular features as the strange train\nof circumstances which I have now taken up my\npen to describe. It was in the latter days of September, and the\nequinoctial gales had set in with exceptional vi-\nolence.

He was a singular man, \ufb01erce and\nquick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was\nangry, and of a most retiring disposition. During\nall the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt\nif ever he set foot in the town. He had a gar-\nden and two or three \ufb01elds round his house, and\nthere he would take his exercise, though very often\nfor weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very\nheavily, but he would see no society and did not\nwant any friends, not even his own brother. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy\nto me, for at the time when he saw me \ufb01rst I was\na youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the\nyear 1878, after he had been eight or nine years\nin England. He begged my father to let me live\nwith him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of play-\ning backgammon and draughts with me, and he\nwould make me his representative both with the\nservants and with the tradespeople, so that by the\ntime that I was sixteen I was quite master of the\nhouse. I kept all the keys and could go where I\nliked and do what I liked, so long as I did not dis-\nturb him in his privacy. There was one singular\nexception, however, for he had a single room, a\nlumber-room up among the attics, which was in-\nvariably locked, and which he would never permit\neither me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\u2019s cu-\nriosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I\nwas never able to see more than such a collection\nof old trunks and bundles as would be expected in\nsuch a room. \u201cOne day\u2014it was in March, 1883\u2014a letter with\na foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the\ncolonel\u2019s plate. It was not a common thing for him\nto receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready\nmoney, and he had no friends of any sort."

I began to laugh\nat this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at\nthe sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes\nwere protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and\nhe glared at the envelope which he still held in his\n176\nThe Five Orange Pips\ntrembling hand, \u2018K. K. K.!\u2019 he shrieked, and then,\n\u2018My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\u2019\n\u201c \u2018What is it, uncle?\u2019 I cried. \u201c \u2018Death,\u2019 said he, and rising from the table he\nretired to his room, leaving me palpitating with\nhorror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled\nin red ink upon the inner \ufb02ap, just above the gum,\nthe letter K three times repeated. There was noth-\ning else save the \ufb01ve dried pips. What could be\nthe reason of his overpowering terror? I left the\nbreakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met\nhim coming down with an old rusty key, which\nmust have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and\na small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other. \u201c \u2018They may do what they like, but I\u2019ll check-\nmate them still,\u2019 said he with an oath. \u2018Tell Mary\nthat I shall want a \ufb01re in my room to-day, and send\ndown to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\u2019\n\u201cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer ar-\nrived I was asked to step up to the room. The \ufb01re\nwas burning brightly, and in the grate there was\na mass of black, \ufb02uffy ashes, as of burned paper,\nwhile the brass box stood open and empty beside\nit. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start,\nthat upon the lid was printed the treble K which I\nhad read in the morning upon the envelope. \u201c \u2018I wish you, John,\u2019 said my uncle, \u2018to witness\nmy will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages\nand all its disadvantages, to my brother, your fa-\nther, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If\nyou can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you\n\ufb01nd you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave\nit to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you\nsuch a two-edged thing, but I can\u2019t say what turn\nthings are going to take. Kindly sign the paper\nwhere Mr. Fordham shows you.\u2019\n\u201cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer\ntook it away with him. The singular incident\nmade, as you may think, the deepest impression\nupon me, and I pondered over it and turned it ev-\nery way in my mind without being able to make\nanything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague\nfeeling of dread which it left behind, though the\nsensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and\nnothing happened to disturb the usual routine of\nour lives."

Most of his time\nhe would spend in his room, with the door locked\nupon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge\nin a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out\nof the house and tear about the garden with a\nrevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was\nafraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped\nup, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When\nthese hot \ufb01ts were over, however, he would rush\ntumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it\nbehind him, like a man who can brazen it out no\nlonger against the terror which lies at the roots of\nhis soul.

We found\nhim, when we went to search for him, face down-\nward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\nat the foot of the garden. There was no sign of\nany violence, and the water was but two feet deep,\nso that the jury, having regard to his known ec-\ncentricity, brought in a verdict of \u2018suicide.\u2019 But I,\nwho knew how he winced from the very thought\nof death, had much ado to persuade myself that\nhe had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter\npassed, however, and my father entered into pos-\nsession of the estate, and of some \u00a314,000, which\nlay to his credit at the bank.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Holmes interposed,\n\u201cyour\nstatement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable\nto which I have ever listened.

We found the brass box there, although its\ncontents had been destroyed. On the inside of the\ncover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\nK. repeated upon it, and \u2018Letters, memoranda, re-\nceipts, and a register\u2019 written beneath. These, we\npresume, indicated the nature of the papers which\nhad been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the\nrest, there was nothing of much importance in the\nattic save a great many scattered papers and note-\nbooks bearing upon my uncle\u2019s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed\nthat he had done his duty well and had borne the\nrepute of a brave soldier."

Upon the sec-\nond day of his absence I received a telegram from\nthe major, imploring me to come at once. My\nfather had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits\nwhich abound in the neighbourhood, and was ly-\ning senseless, with a shattered skull.

Now let us consider the situa-\ntion and see what may be deduced from it.

His extreme love\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he\nwas in fear of someone or something, so we may\nassume as a working hypothesis that it was fear\nof someone or something which drove him from\nAmerica. As to what it was he feared, we can only\ndeduce that by considering the formidable letters\nwhich were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?\u201d\n\u201cThe \ufb01rst was from Pondicherry, the second\nfrom Dundee, and the third from London.\u201d\n\u201cFrom East London. What do you deduce from\nthat?\u201d\n\u201cThey are all seaports. That the writer was on\nboard of a ship.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. We have already a clue. There can\nbe no doubt that the probability\u2014the strong prob-\nability\u2014is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case\nof Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the\nthreat and its ful\ufb01lment, in Dundee it was only\nsome three or four days."

There must\nhave been several in it, and they must have been\nmen of resource and determination. Their papers\nthey mean to have, be the holder of them who it\nmay. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the\ninitials of an individual and becomes the badge of\na society.\u201d\n\u201cBut of what society?\u201d\n\u201cHave you never\u2014\u201d said Sherlock Holmes,\nbending forward and sinking his voice\u2014\u201chave you\nnever heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\u201d\n\u201cI never have.\u201d\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book\nupon his knee. \u201cHere it is,\u201d said he presently:\n\u201c \u2018Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the\nfanciful resemblance to the sound produced\nby cocking a ri\ufb02e. This terrible secret soci-\nety was formed by some ex-Confederate sol-\ndiers in the Southern states after the Civil\nWar, and it rapidly formed local branches\nin different parts of the country, notably in\nTennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Geor-\ngia, and Florida. Its power was used for po-\nlitical purposes, principally for the terroris-\ning of the negro voters and the murdering\nand driving from the country of those who\nwere opposed to its views. Its outrages were\nusually preceded by a warning sent to the\nmarked man in some fantastic but generally\nrecognised shape\u2014a sprig of oak-leaves in\nsome parts, melon seeds or orange pips in\nothers. On receiving this the victim might\neither openly abjure his former ways, or\nmight \ufb02y from the country."

How was it done?\u201d He spoke calmly, but\nI could see that he was deeply moved. \u201cMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and\nthe heading \u2018Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\u2019 Here\nis the account:\n\u201cBetween nine and ten last night Police-\nConstable Cook, of the H Division, on duty\nnear Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help\nand a splash in the water. The night, how-\never, was extremely dark and stormy, so\nthat, in spite of the help of several passers-\nby, it was quite impossible to effect a res-\ncue. The alarm, however, was given, and,\nby the aid of the water-police, the body was\neventually recovered. It proved to be that of\na young gentleman whose name, as it ap-\npears from an envelope which was found in\nhis pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose\nresidence is near Horsham. It is conjec-\ntured that he may have been hurrying down\nto catch the last train from Waterloo Sta-\ntion, and that in his haste and the extreme\ndarkness he missed his path and walked\nover the edge of one of the small landing-\nplaces for river steamboats. The body ex-\nhibited no traces of violence, and there can\nbe no doubt that the deceased had been the\nvictim of an unfortunate accident, which\nshould have the effect of calling the atten-\ntion of the authorities to the condition of\nthe riverside landing-stages.\u201d\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more\ndepressed and shaken than I had ever seen him. \u201cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my\npride. It becomes a personal matter with me now,\nand, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand\nupon this gang. That he should come to me for\nhelp, and that I should send him away to his\ndeath\u2014!\u201d He sprang from his chair and paced\nabout the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a\n\ufb02ush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasp-\ning and unclasping of his long thin hands. \u201cThey must be cunning devils,\u201d he exclaimed\nat last. \u201cHow could they have decoyed him down\nthere? The Embankment is not on the direct line\nto the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too\ncrowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long\nrun. I am going out now!\u201d\n\u201cTo the police?\u201d\n\u201cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have\nspun the web they may take the \ufb02ies, but not be-\nfore.\u201d\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work,\nand it was late in the evening before I returned\nto Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\nback yet. It was nearly ten o\u2019clock before he en-\ntered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to\nthe sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he\ndevoured it voraciously, washing it down with a\nlong draught of water."

I\nwent down to the Albert Dock and found that\nshe had been taken down the river by the early\ntide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah.

He and the\ntwo mates, are as I learn, the only native-born\nAmericans in the ship. The others are Finns and\nGermans. I know, also, that they were all three\naway from the ship last night. I had it from the\nstevedore who has been loading their cargo. By\nthe time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah\nthe mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the\ncable will have informed the police of Savannah\nthat these three gentlemen are badly wanted here\nupon a charge of murder.\u201d\nThere is ever a \ufb02aw, however, in the best laid\nof human plans, and the murderers of John Open-\nshaw were never to receive the orange pips which\nwould show them that another, as cunning and as\nresolute as themselves, was upon their track."

S.\u201d\ncarved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever\nknow of the fate of the Lone Star. The Man with the Twisted Lip\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip\nI\nsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias\nWhitney, D.D., Principal of the Theolog-\nical College of St. George\u2019s, was much\naddicted to opium. The habit grew\nupon him, as I understand, from some foolish\nfreak when he was at college; for having read De\nQuincey\u2019s description of his dreams and sensa-\ntions, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum\nin an attempt to produce the same effects. He\nfound, as so many more have done, that the prac-\ntice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for\nmany years he continued to be a slave to the drug,\nan object of mingled horror and pity to his friends\nand relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,\npasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all\nhuddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble\nman. One night\u2014it was in June, \u201989\u2014there came a\nring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives\nhis \ufb01rst yawn and glances at the clock.

We soothed and comforted her by such words as\nwe could \ufb01nd. Did she know where her husband\nwas? Was it possible that we could bring him back\nto her? It seems that it was. She had the surest in-\nformation that of late he had, when the \ufb01t was\non him, made use of an opium den in the far-\nthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had al-\nways been con\ufb01ned to one day, and he had come\nback, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But\nnow the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty\nhours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs\nof the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping\noff the effects. There he was to be found, she was\nsure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam\nLane. But what was she to do? How could she, a\nyoung and timid woman, make her way into such\na place and pluck her husband out from among\nthe ruf\ufb01ans who surrounded him? There was the case, and of course there was\nbut one way out of it. Might I not escort her to\nthis place? And then, as a second thought, why\nshould she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\u2019s medi-\ncal adviser, and as such I had in\ufb02uence over him. I\ncould manage it better if I were alone. I promised\nher on my word that I would send him home in\na cab within two hours if he were indeed at the\naddress which she had given me. And so in ten\nminutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-\nroom behind me, and was speeding eastward in a\nhansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at\nthe time, though the future only could show how\nstrange it was to be. But there was no great dif\ufb01culty in the \ufb01rst\nstage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a\nvile alley lurking behind the high wharves which\nline the north side of the river to the east of Lon-\ndon Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop,\napproached by a steep \ufb02ight of steps leading down\nto a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the\nden of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to\nwait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the\ncentre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and\nby the light of a \ufb02ickering oil-lamp above the door\nI found the latch and made my way into a long,\nlow room, thick and heavy with the brown opium\nsmoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\nforecastle of an emigrant ship. Through the gloom one could dimly catch a\nglimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses,\nbowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back,\nand chins pointing upward, with here and there a\ndark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer."

We have a seven-mile drive\nbefore us.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am all in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are. You\u2019ll know all about it\npresently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall\nnot need you. Here\u2019s half a crown. Look out for\nme to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\u201d\nHe \ufb02icked the horse with his whip,\nand\nwe dashed away through the endless succession\nof sombre and deserted streets, which widened\ngradually, until we were \ufb02ying across a broad\nbalustraded bridge, with the murky river \ufb02ow-\ning sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another\ndull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence\nbroken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the\npoliceman, or the songs and shouts of some be-\nlated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drift-\ning slowly across the sky, and a star or two twin-\nkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the\nclouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head\nsunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who\nis lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curi-\nous to learn what this new quest might be which\nseemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid\nto break in upon the current of his thoughts. We\nhad driven several miles, and were beginning to\nget to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas,\nwhen he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders,\nand lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has\nsatis\ufb01ed himself that he is acting for the best. \u201cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cIt makes you quite invaluable as a compan-\nion. \u2019Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to\nhave someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are\nnot over-pleasant."

It seems absurdly\nsimple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go\nupon. There\u2019s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I\ncan\u2019t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I\u2019ll state\nthe case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and\nmaybe you can see a spark where all is dark to\nme.\u201d\n\u201cProceed, then.\u201d\n\u201cSome years ago\u2014to be de\ufb01nite,\nin May,\n1884\u2014there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St.\nClair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\nmoney. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds\nvery nicely, and lived generally in good style. By\ndegrees he made friends in the neighbourhood,\nand in 1887 he married the daughter of a local\nbrewer, by whom he now has two children. He\nhad no occupation, but was interested in several\ncompanies and went into town as a rule in the\nmorning, returning by the 5.14 from Cannon Street\nevery night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years\nof age, is a man of temperate habits, a good hus-\nband, a very affectionate father, and a man who\nis popular with all who know him. I may add\nthat his whole debts at the present moment, as far\n189\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip\nas we have been able to ascertain, amount to \u00a388\n10s., while he has \u00a3220 standing to his credit in the\nCapital and Counties Bank. There is no reason,\ntherefore, to think that money troubles have been\nweighing upon his mind. \u201cLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into\ntown rather earlier than usual, remarking before\nhe started that he had two important commis-\nsions to perform, and that he would bring his lit-\ntle boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the mer-\nest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this\nsame Monday, very shortly after his departure, to\nthe effect that a small parcel of considerable value\nwhich she had been expecting was waiting for her\nat the of\ufb01ces of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will\nknow that the of\ufb01ce of the company is in Fresno\nStreet, which branches out of Upper Swandam\nLane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair\nhad her lunch, started for the City, did some shop-\nping, proceeded to the company\u2019s of\ufb01ce, got her\npacket, and found herself at exactly 4.35 walking\nthrough Swandam Lane on her way back to the\nstation. Have you followed me so far?\u201d\n\u201cIt is very clear.\u201d\n\u201cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly\nhot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing\nabout in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not\nlike the neighbourhood in which she found her-\nself."

The\nwindow was open, and she distinctly saw his face,\nwhich she describes as being terribly agitated. He\nwaved his hands frantically to her, and then van-\nished from the window so suddenly that it seemed\nto her that he had been plucked back by some ir-\nresistible force from behind. One singular point\nwhich struck her quick feminine eye was that al-\nthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had\nstarted to town in, he had on neither collar nor\nnecktie. \u201cConvinced that something was amiss with\nhim, she rushed down the steps\u2014for the house\nwas none other than the opium den in which you\nfound me to-night\u2014and running through the front\nroom she attempted to ascend the stairs which led\nto the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor. At the foot of the stairs, however,\nshe met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spo-\nken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane,\nwho acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the\nstreet. Filled with the most maddening doubts and\nfears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-\nfortune, met in Fresno Street a number of consta-\nbles with an inspector, all on their way to their\nbeat. The inspector and two men accompanied her\nback, and in spite of the continued resistance of\nthe proprietor, they made their way to the room in\nwhich Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was\nno sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that\n\ufb02oor there was no one to be found save a crippled\nwretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his\nhome there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore\nthat no one else had been in the front room dur-\ning the afternoon. So determined was their denial\nthat the inspector was staggered, and had almost\ncome to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been de-\nluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal\nbox which lay upon the table and tore the lid from\nit. Out there fell a cascade of children\u2019s bricks. It\nwas the toy which he had promised to bring home. \u201cThis discovery, and the evident confusion\nwhich the cripple showed, made the inspector re-\nalise that the matter was serious. The rooms were\ncarefully examined, and results all pointed to an\nabominable crime. The front room was plainly fur-\nnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bed-\nroom, which looked out upon the back of one of\nthe wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom\nwindow is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide\nbut is covered at high tide with at least four and\na half feet of water. The bedroom window was\na broad one and opened from below."

Thrust\naway behind a curtain in the front room were all\nthe clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the excep-\ntion of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and\nhis watch\u2014all were there. There were no signs of\nviolence upon any of these garments, and there\nwere no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out\nof the window he must apparently have gone for\nno other exit could be discovered, and the ominous\nbloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he\ncould save himself by swimming, for the tide was\nat its very highest at the moment of the tragedy. \u201cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be\nimmediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar\nwas known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\nbut as, by Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s story, he was known to\nhave been at the foot of the stair within a very\nfew seconds of her husband\u2019s appearance at the\nwindow, he could hardly have been more than an\naccessory to the crime. His defence was one of\nabsolute ignorance, and he protested that he had\nno knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone,\n190\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip\nhis lodger, and that he could not account in any\nway for the presence of the missing gentleman\u2019s\nclothes. \u201cSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the\nsinister cripple who lives upon the second \ufb02oor\nof the opium den, and who was certainly the last\nhuman being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.\nClair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous\nface is one which is familiar to every man who\ngoes much to the City. He is a professional beggar,\nthough in order to avoid the police regulations he\npretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little\ndistance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-\nhand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a\nsmall angle in the wall. Here it is that this crea-\nture takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny\nstock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous\nspectacle a small rain of charity descends into the\ngreasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement\nbeside him. I have watched the fellow more than\nonce before ever I thought of making his profes-\nsional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at\nthe harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no\none can pass him without observing him. A shock\nof orange hair, a pale face dis\ufb01gured by a horrible\nscar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the\nouter edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a\npair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a\nsingular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark\nhim out from amid the common crowd of mendi-\ncants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready\nwith a reply to any piece of chaff which may be\nthrown at him by the passers-by."

Surely your\nmedical experience would tell you, Watson, that\nweakness in one limb is often compensated for by\nexceptional strength in the others.\u201d\n\u201cPray continue your narrative.\u201d\n\u201cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the\nblood upon the window, and she was escorted\nhome in a cab by the police, as her presence could\nbe of no help to them in their investigations. In-\nspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made\na very careful examination of the premises, but\nwithout \ufb01nding anything which threw any light\nupon the matter. One mistake had been made in\nnot arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed\nsome few minutes during which he might have\ncommunicated with his friend the Lascar, but this\nfault was soon remedied, and he was seized and\nsearched, without anything being found which\ncould incriminate him. There were, it is true,\nsome blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but\nhe pointed to his ring-\ufb01nger, which had been cut\nnear the nail, and explained that the bleeding came\nfrom there, adding that he had been to the win-\ndow not long before, and that the stains which had\nbeen observed there came doubtless from the same\nsource. He denied strenuously having ever seen\nMr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence\nof the clothes in his room was as much a mystery\nto him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s as-\nsertion that she had actually seen her husband at\nthe window, he declared that she must have been\neither mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly\nprotesting, to the police-station, while the inspec-\ntor remained upon the premises in the hope that\nthe ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue. \u201cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon\nthe mud-bank what they had feared to \ufb01nd. It was\nNeville St. Clair\u2019s coat, and not Neville St. Clair,\nwhich lay uncovered as the tide receded. And\nwhat do you think they found in the pockets?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you would guess. Every\npocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies\u2014421\npennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder\nthat it had not been swept away by the tide. But a\nhuman body is a different matter. There is a \ufb01erce\neddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed\nlikely enough that the weighted coat had remained\nwhen the stripped body had been sucked away\ninto the river.\u201d\n\u201cBut I understand that all the other clothes\nwere found in the room. Would the body be\ndressed in a coat alone?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously\nenough."

I distinctly saw\nhis bare throat.\u201d\n\u201cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken\nopium?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the prin-\ncipal points about which I wished to be abso-\nlutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and\nthen retire, for we may have a very busy day to-\nmorrow.\u201d\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room\nhad been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly\nbetween the sheets, for I was weary after my night\nof adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, how-\never, who, when he had an unsolved problem\nupon his mind, would go for days, and even for\na week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging\nhis facts, looking at it from every point of view\nuntil he had either fathomed it or convinced him-\nself that his data were insuf\ufb01cient. It was soon\nevident to me that he was now preparing for an\nall-night sitting. He took off his coat and waist-\ncoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then\nwandered about the room collecting pillows from\nhis bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs."

In the dim light of the lamp\nI saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between\nhis lips, his eyes \ufb01xed vacantly upon the corner of\nthe ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,\nsilent, motionless, with the light shining upon his\nstrong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped\noff to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejac-\nulation caused me to wake up, and I found the\nsummer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe\nwas still between his lips, the smoke still curled\nupward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco\nhaze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag\nwhich I had seen upon the previous night. \u201cAwake, Watson?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cGame for a morning drive?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\u201cThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know\nwhere the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon\nhave the trap out.\u201d He chuckled to himself as he\nspoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a dif-\nferent man to the sombre thinker of the previous\nnight. As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no\nwonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-\n\ufb01ve minutes past four. I had hardly \ufb01nished when\nHolmes returned with the news that the boy was\nputting in the horse. \u201cI want to test a little theory of mine,\u201d said he,\npulling on his boots. \u201cI think, Watson, that you are\nnow standing in the presence of one of the most\nabsolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked\nfrom here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the\nkey of the affair now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where is it?\u201d I asked, smiling. \u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d he answered. \u201cOh, yes, I\nam not joking,\u201d he continued, seeing my look of\nincredulity. \u201cI have just been there, and I have\ntaken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone\nbag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether\nit will not \ufb01t the lock.\u201d\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as pos-\nsible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the\nhalf-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both\nsprang in, and away we dashed down the London\nRoad. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in\nvegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas\non either side were as silent and lifeless as some\ncity in a dream. \u201cIt has been in some points a singular case,\u201d\nsaid Holmes, \ufb02icking the horse on into a gallop. \u201cI\nconfess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it\nis better to learn wisdom late than never to learn\nit at all.\u201d\nIn town the earliest risers were just begin-\nning to look sleepily from their windows as we\n194\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip\ndrove through the streets of the Surrey side."

One of them held the horse\u2019s head\nwhile the other led us in. \u201cWho is on duty?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\u201d A tall, stout of-\n\ufb01cial had come down the stone-\ufb02agged passage, in\na peaked cap and frogged jacket. \u201cI wish to have a\nquiet word with you, Bradstreet.\u201d \u201cCertainly, Mr.\nHolmes. Step into my room here.\u201d It was a small,\nof\ufb01ce-like room, with a huge ledger upon the ta-\nble, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The\ninspector sat down at his desk. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cI called about that beggarman, Boone\u2014the\none who was charged with being concerned in the\ndisappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\u201d\n\u201cYes. He was brought up and remanded for\nfurther inquiries.\u201d\n\u201cSo I heard. You have him here?\u201d\n\u201cIn the cells.\u201d\n\u201cIs he quiet?\u201d\n\u201cOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty\nscoundrel.\u201d\n\u201cDirty?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his\nhands, and his face is as black as a tinker\u2019s. Well,\nwhen once his case has been settled, he will have\na regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him,\nyou would agree with me that he needed it.\u201d\n\u201cI should like to see him very much.\u201d\n\u201cWould you? That is easily done. Come this\nway. You can leave your bag.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think that I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\u201cVery good. Come this way, if you please.\u201d\nHe led us down a passage, opened a barred door,\npassed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each\nside. \u201cThe third on the right is his,\u201d said the inspec-\ntor. \u201cHere it is!\u201d He quietly shot back a panel in\nthe upper part of the door and glanced through. \u201cHe is asleep,\u201d said he. \u201cYou can see him very\nwell.\u201d\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The pris-\noner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep\nsleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a\nmiddle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his\ncalling, with a coloured shirt protruding through\nthe rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspec-\ntor had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which\ncovered his face could not conceal its repulsive ug-\nliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right\nacross it from eye to chin, and by its contraction\nhad turned up one side of the upper lip, so that\nthree teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A\nshock of very bright red hair grew low over his\neyes and forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHe\ncertainly\nneeds\na\nwash,\u201d\nremarked\nHolmes."

The case would\nthen never go into court at all.\u201d\n\u201cGod bless you!\u201d cried the prisoner passion-\nately. \u201cI would have endured imprisonment, ay,\neven execution, rather than have left my miserable\nsecret as a family blot to my children. \u201cYou are the \ufb01rst who have ever heard my\nstory. My father was a schoolmaster in Chester-\n\ufb01eld, where I received an excellent education. I\ntravelled in my youth, took to the stage, and \ufb01-\nnally became a reporter on an evening paper in\nLondon. One day my editor wished to have a se-\nries of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and\nI volunteered to supply them. There was the point\nfrom which all my adventures started. It was only\nby trying begging as an amateur that I could get\nthe facts upon which to base my articles. When\nan actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets\nof making up, and had been famous in the green-\nroom for my skill. I took advantage now of my\nattainments. I painted my face, and to make my-\nself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and\n\ufb01xed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of\na small slip of \ufb02esh-coloured plaster. Then with a\nred head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took\nmy station in the business part of the city, osten-\nsibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For\nseven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned\nhome in the evening I found to my surprise that I\nhad received no less than 26s. 4d. \u201cI wrote my articles and thought little more of\nthe matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for\na friend and had a writ served upon me for \u00a325. I\nwas at my wit\u2019s end where to get the money, but\na sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight\u2019s\ngrace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from\nmy employers, and spent the time in begging in\nthe City under my disguise. In ten days I had the\nmoney and had paid the debt. \u201cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to set-\ntle down to arduous work at \u00a32 a week when I\nknew that I could earn as much in a day by smear-\ning my face with a little paint, laying my cap on\nthe ground, and sitting still. It was a long \ufb01ght\nbetween my pride and the money, but the dollars\nwon at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day\nafter day in the corner which I had \ufb01rst chosen,\ninspiring pity by my ghastly face and \ufb01lling my\npockets with coppers. Only one man knew my se-\ncret. He was the keeper of a low den in which\nI used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could\nevery morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in\nthe evenings transform myself into a well-dressed\nman about town."

I do not mean that any\nbeggar in the streets of London could earn \u00a3700 a\nyear\u2014which is less than my average takings\u2014but\nI had exceptional advantages in my power of mak-\ning up, and also in a facility of repartee, which\nimproved by practice and made me quite a recog-\nnised character in the City. All day a stream of\npennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and\nit was a very bad day in which I failed to take \u00a32. \u201cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took\na house in the country, and eventually married,\nwithout anyone having a suspicion as to my real\noccupation. My dear wife knew that I had busi-\nness in the City. She little knew what. \u201cLast Monday I had \ufb01nished for the day and\nwas dressing in my room above the opium den\nwhen I looked out of my window and saw, to my\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was stand-\ning in the street, with her eyes \ufb01xed full upon me.

I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew\nthat she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my\nclothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my\npigments and wig. Even a wife\u2019s eyes could not\npierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred\nto me that there might be a search in the room,\nand that the clothes might betray me. I threw open\nthe window, reopening by my violence a small cut\nwhich I had in\ufb02icted upon myself in the bedroom\nthat morning. Then I seized my coat, which was\nweighted by the coppers which I had just trans-\nferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried\nmy takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it\ndisappeared into the Thames. The other clothes\nwould have followed, but at that moment there\nwas a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\nminutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my re-\nlief, that instead of being identi\ufb01ed as Mr. Neville\nSt. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer. \u201cI do not know that there is anything else for\nme to explain. I was determined to preserve my\ndisguise as long as possible, and hence my prefer-\nence for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would\nbe terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and con-\n\ufb01ded it to the Lascar at a moment when no con-\nstable was watching me, together with a hurried\nscrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\u201d\n\u201cThat note only reached her yesterday,\u201d said\nHolmes."

The facts are these: about\nfour o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who,\nas you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning\nfrom some small jolli\ufb01cation and was making his\nway homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In\nfront of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man,\nwalking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white\ngoose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between\nthis stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of\nthe latter knocked off the man\u2019s hat, on which he\nraised his stick to defend himself and, swinging\nit over his head, smashed the shop window be-\nhind him. Peterson had rushed forward to pro-\ntect the stranger from his assailants; but the man,\nshocked at having broken the window, and seeing\nan of\ufb01cial-looking person in uniform rushing to-\nwards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels,\nand vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets\nwhich lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.

He had\nforesight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\nto a moral retrogression, which, when taken with\nthe decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some\nevil in\ufb02uence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his\nwife has ceased to love him.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\n\u201cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-\nrespect,\u201d he continued, disregarding my remon-\nstrance. \u201cHe is a man who leads a sedentary\nlife, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is\nmiddle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had\ncut within the last few days, and which he anoints\nwith lime-cream. These are the more patent facts\nwhich are to be deduced from his hat."

Is it possible that even now,\nwhen I give you these results, you are unable to\nsee how they are attained?\u201d\n\u201cI have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I\nmust confess that I am unable to follow you. For\nexample, how did you deduce that this man was\nintellectual?\u201d\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his\nhead. It came right over the forehead and settled\nupon the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt is a question of cu-\nbic capacity,\u201d said he; \u201ca man with so large a brain\nmust have something in it.\u201d\n\u201cThe decline of his fortunes, then?\u201d\n\u201cThis hat is three years old. These \ufb02at brims\ncurled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the\nvery best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk\nand the excellent lining. If this man could afford\nto buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has\nhad no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down\nin the world.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how\nabout the foresight and the moral retrogression?\u201d\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \u201cHere is the fore-\nsight,\u201d said he putting his \ufb01nger upon the little\ndisc and loop of the hat-securer. \u201cThey are never\nsold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a\nsign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went\nout of his way to take this precaution against the\nwind. But since we see that he has broken the elas-\ntic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious\nthat he has less foresight now than formerly, which\nis a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the\nother hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some\nof these stains upon the felt by daubing them with\nink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his\nself-respect.\u201d\n\u201cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\u201d\n\u201cThe further points, that he is middle-aged,\nthat his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently\ncut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gath-\nered from a close examination of the lower part of\nthe lining. The lens discloses a large number of\nhair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a dis-\ntinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will ob-\nserve, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but\nthe \ufb02uffy brown dust of the house, showing that it\n202\nThe Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\nhas been hung up indoors most of the time, while\nthe marks of moisture upon the inside are proof\npositive that the wearer perspired very freely, and\ncould therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\u201d\n\u201cBut his wife\u2014you said that she had ceased to\nlove him.\u201d\n\u201cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks."

I ought to know its size and\nshape, seeing that I have read the advertisement\nabout it in The Times every day lately. It is ab-\nsolutely unique, and its value can only be conjec-\ntured, but the reward offered of \u00a31000 is certainly\nnot within a twentieth part of the market price.\u201d\n\u201cA thousand pounds!

The\nevidence against him was so strong that the case\nhas been referred to the Assizes. I have some ac-\ncount of the matter here, I believe.\u201d He rummaged\namid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, un-\ntil at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over,\nand read the following paragraph:\n\u201cHotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John\nHorner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon\nthe charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,\nabstracted from the jewel-case of the Count-\ness of Morcar the valuable gem known as\nthe blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-\nattendant at the hotel, gave his evidence\nto the effect that he had shown Horner\nup to the dressing-room of the Countess\nof Morcar upon the day of the robbery in\norder that he might solder the second bar\nof the grate, which was loose. He had re-\nmained with Horner some little time, but\nhad \ufb01nally been called away. On return-\ning, he found that Horner had disappeared,\nthat the bureau had been forced open, and\nthat the small morocco casket in which, as\nit afterwards transpired, the Countess was\naccustomed to keep her jewel, was lying\nempty upon the dressing-table. Ryder in-\nstantly gave the alarm, and Horner was ar-\nrested the same evening; but the stone could\n203\nThe Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\nnot be found either upon his person or in\nhis rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the\nCountess, deposed to having heard Ryder\u2019s\ncry of dismay on discovering the robbery,\nand to having rushed into the room, where\nshe found matters as described by the last\nwitness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division,\ngave evidence as to the arrest of Horner,\nwho struggled frantically, and protested his\ninnocence in the strongest terms. Evidence\nof a previous conviction for robbery having\nbeen given against the prisoner, the magis-\ntrate refused to deal summarily with the of-\nfence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner,\nwho had shown signs of intense emotion\nduring the proceedings, fainted away at the\nconclusion and was carried out of court.\u201d\n\u201cHum!

You see, Watson, our little deductions have\nsuddenly assumed a much more important and\nless innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone\ncame from the goose, and the goose came from\nMr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat\nand all the other characteristics with which I have\nbored you. So now we must set ourselves very\nseriously to \ufb01nding this gentleman and ascertain-\ning what part he has played in this little mystery.

It was found in the banks of\nthe Amoy River in southern China and is remark-\nable in having every characteristic of the carbun-\ncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby\nred. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister\nhistory. There have been two murders, a vitriol-\nthrowing, a suicide, and several robberies brought\nabout for the sake of this forty-grain weight of\ncrystallised charcoal.

Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look\nat that third name. Just read it out to me.\u201d\n\u201cMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\u2014249,\u201d read\nHolmes. \u201cQuite so.

He\ndrew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it\ndown upon the slab, turning away with the air of\na man whose disgust is too deep for words. A\nfew yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and\nlaughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was\npeculiar to him. \u201cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut\nand the \u2018Pink \u2019un\u2019 protruding out of his pocket,\nyou can always draw him by a bet,\u201d said he. \u201cI\ndaresay that if I had put \u00a3100 down in front of him,\nthat man would not have given me such complete\ninformation as was drawn from him by the idea\nthat he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson,\nwe are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and\nthe only point which remains to be determined is\nwhether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott\nto-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-\nmorrow."

There was no place\nabout the hotel where it would be safe. I went out,\n208\nThe Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\nas if on some commission, and I made for my sis-\nter\u2019s house.

One day he had met me, and fell into\ntalk about the ways of thieves, and how they could\nget rid of what they stole. I knew that he would\nbe true to me, for I knew one or two things about\nhim; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kil-\nburn, where he lived, and take him into my con\ufb01-\ndence. He would show me how to turn the stone\ninto money. But how to get to him in safety? I\nthought of the agonies I had gone through in com-\ning from the hotel. I might at any moment be\nseized and searched, and there would be the stone\nin my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the\nwall at the time and looking at the geese which\nwere waddling about round my feet, and suddenly\nan idea came into my head which showed me how\nI could beat the best detective that ever lived. \u201cMy sister had told me some weeks before that\nI might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas\npresent, and I knew that she was always as good\nas her word. I would take my goose now, and in\nit I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was\na little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove\none of the birds\u2014a \ufb01ne big one, white, with a\nbarred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open,\nI thrust the stone down its throat as far as my \ufb01n-\nger could reach.

The events in\nquestion occurred in the early days of my associ-\nation with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms\nas bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I\nmight have placed them upon record before, but\na promise of secrecy was made at the time, from\nwhich I have only been freed during the last month\nby the untimely death of the lady to whom the\npledge was given.

A lady\ndressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been\nsitting in the window, rose as we entered. \u201cGood-morning, madam,\u201d said Holmes cheer-\nily. \u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes.

You may\nadvise me how to walk amid the dangers which\nencompass me.\u201d\n\u201cI am all attention, madam.\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with\nmy stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of\nthe oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts\nof Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\u201d\nHolmes nodded his head. \u201cThe name is famil-\niar to me,\u201d said he. \u201cThe family was at one time among the richest\nin England, and the estates extended over the bor-\nders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in\nthe west. In the last century, however, four succes-\nsive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposi-\ntion, and the family ruin was eventually completed\nby a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing\nwas left save a few acres of ground, and the two-\nhundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed\nunder a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged\nout his existence there, living the horrible life of\nan aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfa-\nther, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new\nconditions, obtained an advance from a relative,\nwhich enabled him to take a medical degree and\nwent out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\nskill and his force of character, he established a\nlarge practice. In a \ufb01t of anger, however, caused by\nsome robberies which had been perpetrated in the\nhouse, he beat his native butler to death and nar-\nrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suf-\nfered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards\nreturned to England a morose and disappointed\nman. \u201cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my\nmother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-\nGeneral Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years\nold at the time of my mother\u2019s re-marriage."

Shortly\nafter our return to England my mother died\u2014she\nwas killed eight years ago in a railway accident\nnear Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his at-\ntempts to establish himself in practice in London\nand took us to live with him in the old ances-\ntral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my\nmother had left was enough for all our wants, and\nthere seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness. \u201cBut a terrible change came over our stepfather\nabout this time. Instead of making friends and ex-\nchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at\n\ufb01rst been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran\nback in the old family seat, he shut himself up in\nhis house and seldom came out save to indulge in\nferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his\npath. Violence of temper approaching to mania\nhas been hereditary in the men of the family, and\nin my stepfather\u2019s case it had, I believe, been in-\ntensi\ufb01ed by his long residence in the tropics. A se-\nries of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which\nended in the police-court, until at last he became\nthe terror of the village, and the folks would \ufb02y at\nhis approach, for he is a man of immense strength,\nand absolutely uncontrollable in his anger. \u201cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over\na parapet into a stream, and it was only by pay-\n214\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band\ning over all the money which I could gather to-\ngether that I was able to avert another public expo-\nsure. He had no friends at all save the wandering\ngypsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave\nto encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered\nland which represent the family estate, and would\naccept in return the hospitality of their tents, wan-\ndering away with them sometimes for weeks on\nend. He has a passion also for Indian animals,\nwhich are sent over to him by a correspondent,\nand he has at this moment a cheetah and a ba-\nboon, which wander freely over his grounds and\nare feared by the villagers almost as much as their\nmaster. \u201cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor\nsister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time\nwe did all the work of the house. She was but\nthirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair\nhad already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\u201d\n\u201cYour sister is dead, then?\u201d\n\u201cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her\ndeath that I wish to speak to you.

Ju-\nlia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met\nthere a half-pay major of marines, to whom she\nbecame engaged. My stepfather learned of the en-\ngagement when my sister returned and offered no\nobjection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of\nthe day which had been \ufb01xed for the wedding, the\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of\nmy only companion.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his\nchair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in\na cushion, but he half opened his lids now and\nglanced across at his visitor. \u201cPray be precise as to details,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event\nof that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very\nold, and only one wing is now inhabited. The\nbedrooms in this wing are on the ground \ufb02oor,\nthe sitting-rooms being in the central block of the\nbuildings. Of these bedrooms the \ufb01rst is Dr. Roy-\nlott\u2019s, the second my sister\u2019s, and the third my\nown. There is no communication between them,\nbut they all open out into the same corridor. Do I\nmake myself plain?\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly so.\u201d\n\u201cThe windows of the three rooms open out\nupon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had\ngone to his room early, though we knew that he\nhad not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled\nby the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it\nwas his custom to smoke. She left her room, there-\nfore, and came into mine, where she sat for some\ntime, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\neleven o\u2019clock she rose to leave me, but she paused\nat the door and looked back. \u201c \u2018Tell me, Helen,\u2019 said she, \u2018have you ever\nheard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Never,\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018I suppose that you could not possibly whis-\ntle, yourself, in your sleep?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Certainly not. But why?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Because during the last few nights I have\nalways, about three in the morning, heard a\nlow, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it\nhas awakened me. I cannot tell where it came\nfrom\u2014perhaps from the next room, perhaps from\nthe lawn. I thought that I would just ask you\nwhether you had heard it.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018No, I have not. It must be those wretched\ngipsies in the plantation.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I\nwonder that you did not hear it also.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Well, it is of no great consequence, at any\nrate.\u2019 She smiled back at me, closed my door, and\na few moments later I heard her key turn in the\nlock.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Holmes."

We had no feeling of\nsecurity unless our doors were locked.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\u201d\n\u201cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling\nof impending misfortune impressed me. My sis-\nter and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two\nsouls which are so closely allied. It was a wild\nnight. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\nwas beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there\nburst forth the wild scream of a terri\ufb01ed woman. I knew that it was my sister\u2019s voice. I sprang\nfrom my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and\nrushed into the corridor. As I opened my door\n215\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band\nI seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sis-\nter described, and a few moments later a clanging\nsound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran\ndown the passage, my sister\u2019s door was unlocked,\nand revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at\nit horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to\nissue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp\nI saw my sister appear at the opening, her face\nblanched with terror, her hands groping for help,\nher whole \ufb01gure swaying to and fro like that of a\ndrunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round\nher, but at that moment her knees seemed to give\nway and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one\nwho is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dread-\nfully convulsed. At \ufb01rst I thought that she had\nnot recognised me, but as I bent over her she sud-\ndenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\nforget, \u2018Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The\nspeckled band!\u2019 There was something else which\nshe would fain have said, and she stabbed with\nher \ufb01nger into the air in the direction of the doc-\ntor\u2019s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and\nchoked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for\nmy stepfather, and I met him hastening from his\nroom in his dressing-gown. When he reached my\nsister\u2019s side she was unconscious, and though he\npoured brandy down her throat and sent for med-\nical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain,\nfor she slowly sank and died without having re-\ncovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\nend of my beloved sister.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d said Holmes, \u201care you sure\nabout this whistle and metallic sound? Could you\nswear to it?\u201d\n\u201cThat was what the county coroner asked me\nat the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I\nheard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and\nthe creaking of an old house, I may possibly have\nbeen deceived.\u201d\n\u201cWas your sister dressed?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she was in her night-dress."

To me at least\nthere was a strange contrast between the sweet\npromise of the spring and this sinister quest upon\nwhich we were engaged. My companion sat in the\nfront of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled\ndown over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his\nbreast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly,\nhowever, he started, tapped me on the shoulder,\nand pointed over the meadows. \u201cLook there!\u201d said he.

You see that we have been as good as\nour word.\u201d\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward\nto meet us with a face which spoke her joy. \u201cI have\nbeen waiting so eagerly for you,\u201d she cried, shak-\ning hands with us warmly. \u201cAll has turned out\nsplendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is\nunlikely that he will be back before evening.\u201d\n\u201cWe have had the pleasure of making the doc-\ntor\u2019s acquaintance,\u201d said Holmes, and in a few\nwords he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened. \u201cGood heavens!\u201d she cried, \u201che has followed\nme, then.\u201d\n\u201cSo it appears.\u201d\n\u201cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am\nsafe from him. What will he say when he returns?\u201d\n\u201cHe must guard himself, for he may \ufb01nd that\nthere is someone more cunning than himself upon\nhis track. You must lock yourself up from him to-\nnight. If he is violent, we shall take you away to\nyour aunt\u2019s at Harrow. Now, we must make the\nbest use of our time, so kindly take us at once to\nthe rooms which we are to examine.\u201d\nThe building was of grey,\nlichen-blotched\nstone, with a high central portion and two curving\nwings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each\nside. In one of these wings the windows were bro-\nken and blocked with wooden boards, while the\nroof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The\ncentral portion was in little better repair, but the\nright-hand block was comparatively modern, and\nthe blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke\ncurling up from the chimneys, showed that this\nwas where the family resided. Some scaffolding\nhad been erected against the end wall, and the\nstone-work had been broken into, but there were\nno signs of any workmen at the moment of our\nvisit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-\ntrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention\nthe outsides of the windows."

But I am now sleeping in the mid-\ndle one.\u201d\n\u201cPending the alterations, as I understand. By\nthe way, there does not seem to be any very press-\ning need for repairs at that end wall.\u201d\n\u201cThere were none. I believe that it was an ex-\ncuse to move me from my room.\u201d\n\u201cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side\nof this narrow wing runs the corridor from which\nthese three rooms open. There are windows in it,\nof course?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for any-\none to pass through.\u201d\n\u201cAs you both locked your doors at night, your\nrooms were unapproachable from that side. Now,\nwould you have the kindness to go into your room\nand bar your shutters?\u201d\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful\nexamination through the open window, endeav-\noured in every way to force the shutter open, but\nwithout success. There was no slit through which\na knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then\nwith his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of\nsolid iron, built \ufb01rmly into the massive masonry. \u201cHum!\u201d said he, scratching his chin in some per-\nplexity, \u201cmy theory certainly presents some dif\ufb01-\nculties. No one could pass these shutters if they\nwere bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws\nany light upon the matter.\u201d\nA small side door led into the whitewashed\ncorridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\nwe passed at once to the second, that in which\nMiss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her\nsister had met with her fate. It was a homely\nlittle room, with a low ceiling and a gaping \ufb01re-\nplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A\nbrown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a\nnarrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and\na dressing-table on the left-hand side of the win-\ndow. These articles, with two small wicker-work\n219\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band\nchairs, made up all the furniture in the room save\nfor a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The\nboards round and the panelling of the walls were\nof brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured\nthat it may have dated from the original building\nof the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into\na corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled\nround and round and up and down, taking in ev-\nery detail of the apartment. \u201cWhere does that bell communicate with?\u201d he\nasked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which\nhung down beside the bed, the tassel actually ly-\ning upon the pillow. \u201cIt goes to the housekeeper\u2019s room.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks newer than the other things?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was only put there a couple of years\nago.\u201d\n\u201cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I never heard of her using it."

You will excuse me for a few\nminutes while I satisfy myself as to this \ufb02oor.\u201d He\nthrew himself down upon his face with his lens in\nhis hand and crawled swiftly backward and for-\nward, examining minutely the cracks between the\nboards. Then he did the same with the wood-work\nwith which the chamber was panelled. Finally he\nwalked over to the bed and spent some time in\nstaring at it and in running his eye up and down\nthe wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand\nand gave it a brisk tug. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s a dummy,\u201d said he. \u201cWon\u2019t it ring?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is\nvery interesting. You can see now that it is fas-\ntened to a hook just above where the little opening\nfor the ventilator is.\u201d\n\u201cHow very absurd!

With your permission,\nMiss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into\nthe inner apartment.\u201d\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s chamber was larger\nthan that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly\nfurnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full\nof books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-\nchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against\nthe wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were\nthe principal things which met the eye. Holmes\nwalked slowly round and examined each and all\nof them with the keenest interest. \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d he asked, tapping the safe. \u201cMy stepfather\u2019s business papers.\u201d\n\u201cOh! you have seen inside, then?\u201d\n\u201cOnly once, some years ago. I remember that\nit was full of papers.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a cat in it, for example?\u201d\n\u201cNo. What a strange idea!\u201d\n\u201cWell, look at this!\u201d He took up a small saucer\nof milk which stood on the top of it. \u201cNo; we don\u2019t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah\nand a baboon.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big\ncat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in\nsatisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point\nwhich I should wish to determine.\u201d He squatted\ndown in front of the wooden chair and examined\nthe seat of it with the greatest attention. \u201cThank you. That is quite settled,\u201d said he, ris-\ning and putting his lens in his pocket."

They were on the upper \ufb02oor, and from our\nwindow we could command a view of the avenue\ngate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran\nManor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roy-\nlott drive past, his huge form looming up beside\nthe little \ufb01gure of the lad who drove him. The boy\nhad some slight dif\ufb01culty in undoing the heavy\niron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the\ndoctor\u2019s voice and saw the fury with which he\nshook his clinched \ufb01sts at him. The trap drove\non, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light\nspring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in\none of the sitting-rooms. \u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said Holmes as we sat\ntogether in the gathering darkness, \u201cI have really\nsome scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a\ndistinct element of danger.\u201d\n\u201cCan I be of assistance?\u201d\n\u201cYour presence might be invaluable.\u201d\n\u201cThen I shall certainly come.\u201d\n\u201cIt is very kind of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen\nmore in these rooms than was visible to me.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a lit-\ntle more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.\u201d\n\u201cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope,\nand what purpose that could answer I confess is\nmore than I can imagine.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw the ventilator, too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very un-\nusual thing to have a small opening between two\nrooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass\nthrough.\u201d\n\u201cI knew that we should \ufb01nd a ventilator before\never we came to Stoke Moran.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement\nshe said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott\u2019s\ncigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that\nthere must be a communication between the two\nrooms. It could only be a small one, or it would\nhave been remarked upon at the coroner\u2019s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\u201d\n\u201cBut what harm can there be in that?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of\ndates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and\na lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that\nstrike you?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot as yet see any connection.\u201d\n221\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band\n\u201cDid you observe anything very peculiar about\nthat bed?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIt was clamped to the \ufb02oor. Did you ever see\na bed fastened like that before?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot say that I have.\u201d\n\u201cThe lady could not move her bed. It must al-\nways be in the same relative position to the venti-\nlator and to the rope\u2014or so we may call it, since it\nwas clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\u201d\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cI seem to see dimly what\nyou are hinting at."

He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\nPritchard were among the heads of their profes-\nsion. This man strikes even deeper, but I think,\nWatson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night\nis over; for goodness\u2019 sake let us have a quiet pipe\nand turn our minds for a few hours to something\nmore cheerful.\u201d\nAbout nine o\u2019clock the light among the trees\nwas extinguished, and all was dark in the direc-\ntion of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of\neleven, a single bright light shone out right in front\nof us. \u201cThat is our signal,\u201d said Holmes, springing to\nhis feet; \u201cit comes from the middle window.\u201d\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words\nwith the landlord, explaining that we were going\non a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\npossible that we might spend the night there. A\nmoment later we were out on the dark road, a\nchill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to\nguide us on our sombre errand. There was little dif\ufb01culty in entering the\ngrounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old\npark wall. Making our way among the trees, we\nreached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to\nenter through the window when out from a clump\nof laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a\nhideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon\nthe grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly\nacross the lawn into the darkness. \u201cMy God!\u201d I whispered; \u201cdid you see it?\u201d\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his\nagitation.

I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,\nafter following Holmes\u2019 example and slipping off\nmy shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My\ncompanion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved\nthe lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round\nthe room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gen-\ntly that it was all that I could do to distinguish the\nwords:\n\u201cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.\u201d\nI nodded to show that I had heard. \u201cWe must sit without light."

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and\nthis he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he\nlaid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left\nin darkness. How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I\ncould not hear a sound, not even the drawing of\na breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\nopen-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same\nstate of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we\nwaited in absolute darkness. From outside came the occasional cry of a\nnight-bird, and once at our very window a long\ndrawn catlike whine, which told us that the chee-\ntah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear\nthe deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed\nout every quarter of an hour. How long they\nseemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one\nand two and three, and still we sat waiting silently\nfor whatever might befall. Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a\nlight up in the direction of the ventilator, which\nvanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\n222\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band\nstrong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\nall was silent once more, though the smell grew\nstronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible\u2014a\nvery gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet\nof steam escaping continually from a kettle. The\ninstant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the\nbed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his\ncane at the bell-pull. \u201cYou see it, Watson?\u201d he yelled. \u201cYou see it?\u201d\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when\nHolmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whis-\ntle, but the sudden glare \ufb02ashing into my weary\neyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was\nat which my friend lashed so savagely. I could,\nhowever, see that his face was deadly pale and\n\ufb01lled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to\nstrike and was gazing up at the ventilator when\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night\nthe most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of\npain and fear and anger all mingled in the one\ndreadful shriek.

Twice he struck at\nthe chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his\nheels, with the cocked pistol in my hand. It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On\nthe table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half\nopen, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the\niron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roy-\nlott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare\nankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into\nred heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the\nshort stock with the long lash which we had no-\nticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward\nand his eyes were \ufb01xed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\nthe corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had\na peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles,\nwhich seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion. \u201cThe band! the speckled band!\u201d whispered\nHolmes. I took a step forward. In an instant his strange\nheadgear began to move, and there reared itself\nfrom among his hair the squat diamond-shaped\nhead and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent. \u201cIt is a swamp adder!\u201d cried Holmes; \u201cthe\ndeadliest snake in India. He has died within ten\nseconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into\nthe pit which he digs for another.

Such are the true facts of the death of Dr.\nGrimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not nec-\nessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\nalready run to too great a length by telling how\nwe broke the sad news to the terri\ufb01ed girl, how\nwe conveyed her by the morning train to the care\nof her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow pro-\ncess of of\ufb01cial inquiry came to the conclusion that\nthe doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing\nwith a dangerous pet.

The presence of the gipsies, and the use of\nthe word \u2018band,\u2019 which was used by the poor girl,\nno doubt, to explain the appearance which she had\ncaught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her\nmatch, were suf\ufb01cient to put me upon an entirely\nwrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I in-\nstantly reconsidered my position when, however,\nit became clear to me that whatever danger threat-\nened an occupant of the room could not come ei-\nther from the window or the door. My attention\nwas speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to\nyou, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which\nhung down to the bed. The discovery that this was\na dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\n\ufb02oor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the\nrope was there as a bridge for something passing\nthrough the hole and coming to the bed. The idea\nof a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I\ncoupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was\nfurnished with a supply of creatures from India, I\nfelt that I was probably on the right track. The idea\n223\nof using a form of poison which could not possi-\nbly be discovered by any chemical test was just\nsuch a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless\nman who had had an Eastern training. The ra-\npidity with which such a poison would take effect\nwould also, from his point of view, be an advan-\ntage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed,\nwho could distinguish the two little dark punc-\ntures which would show where the poison fangs\nhad done their work. Then I thought of the whis-\ntle. Of course he must recall the snake before the\nmorning light revealed it to the victim. He had\ntrained it, probably by the use of the milk which\nwe saw, to return to him when summoned. He\nwould put it through this ventilator at the hour\nthat he thought best, with the certainty that it\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It\nmight or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she\nmight escape every night for a week, but sooner or\nlater she must fall a victim. \u201cI had come to these conclusions before ever I\nhad entered his room. An inspection of his chair\nshowed me that he had been in the habit of stand-\ning on it, which of course would be necessary in\norder that he should reach the ventilator. The\nsight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop\nof whipcord were enough to \ufb01nally dispel any\ndoubts which may have remained. The metallic\nclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused\nby her stepfather hastily closing the door of his\nsafe upon its terrible occupant."

Of these the latter may have\nafforded a \ufb01ner \ufb01eld for an acute and original ob-\nserver, but the other was so strange in its inception\nand so dramatic in its details that it may be the\nmore worthy of being placed upon record, even if\nit gave my friend fewer openings for those deduc-\ntive methods of reasoning by which he achieved\nsuch remarkable results. The story has, I believe,\nbeen told more than once in the newspapers, but,\nlike all such narratives, its effect is much less strik-\ning when set forth en bloc in a single half-column\nof print than when the facts slowly evolve before\nyour own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually\naway as each new discovery furnishes a step which\nleads on to the complete truth. At the time the cir-\ncumstances made a deep impression upon me, and\nthe lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken\nthe effect. It was in the summer of \u201989, not long after\nmy marriage, that the events occurred which I\nam now about to summarise. I had returned to\ncivil practice and had \ufb01nally abandoned Holmes\nin his Baker Street rooms, although I continually\nvisited him and occasionally even persuaded him\nto forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come\nand visit us. My practice had steadily increased,\nand as I happened to live at no very great distance\nfrom Paddington Station, I got a few patients from\namong the of\ufb01cials. One of these, whom I had\ncured of a painful and lingering disease, was never\nweary of advertising my virtues and of endeavour-\ning to send me on every sufferer over whom he\nmight have any in\ufb02uence. One morning, at a little before seven o\u2019clock, I\nwas awakened by the maid tapping at the door to\nannounce that two men had come from Padding-\nton and were waiting in the consulting-room."

I entered my consulting-room and found a\ngentleman seated by the table. He was quietly\ndressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft\ncloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief\nwrapped, which was mottled all over with blood-\nstains. He was young, not more than \ufb01ve-and-\ntwenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face;\nbut he was exceedingly pale and gave me the im-\npression of a man who was suffering from some\nstrong agitation, which it took all his strength of\nmind to control. \u201cI am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cbut I have had a very serious accident\nduring the night.

He laughed\nvery heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning\nback in his chair and shaking his sides. All my\nmedical instincts rose up against that laugh. \u201cStop it!\u201d I cried; \u201cpull yourself together!\u201d and\nI poured out some water from a caraffe. It was useless, however. He was off in one\nof those hysterical outbursts which come upon a\nstrong nature when some great crisis is over and\ngone. Presently he came to himself once more,\nvery weary and pale-looking. \u201cI have been making a fool of myself,\u201d he\ngasped. \u201cNot at all.

At last, however, the bumping\nof the road was exchanged for the crisp smooth-\nness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a\nstand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and,\nas I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a\nporch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it\nwere, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so\nthat I failed to catch the most \ufb02eeting glance of the\nfront of the house. The instant that I had crossed\nthe threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,\nand I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the\ncarriage drove away. \u201cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the\ncolonel fumbled about looking for matches and\nmuttering under his breath. Suddenly a door\nopened at the other end of the passage, and a long,\ngolden bar of light shot out in our direction."

I could see\nthat she was pretty, and from the gloss with which\nthe light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it\nwas a rich material. She spoke a few words in a\nforeign tongue in a tone as though asking a ques-\ntion, and when my companion answered in a gruff\nmonosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp\nnearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up\nto her, whispered something in her ear, and then,\npushing her back into the room from whence she\nhad come, he walked towards me again with the\nlamp in his hand. \u201c \u2018Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait\nin this room for a few minutes,\u2019 said he, throwing\nopen another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly\nfurnished room, with a round table in the centre,\non which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of\na harmonium beside the door. \u2018I shall not keep\nyou waiting an instant,\u2019 said he, and vanished into\nthe darkness. \u201cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in\nspite of my ignorance of German I could see that\ntwo of them were treatises on science, the others\nbeing volumes of poetry. Then I walked across\nto the window, hoping that I might catch some\nglimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter,\nheavily barred, was folded across it. It was a won-\nderfully silent house. There was an old clock tick-\ning loudly somewhere in the passage, but other-\nwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling\nof uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were\nthese German people, and what were they doing\nliving in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And\nwhere was the place? I was ten miles or so from\nEyford, that was all I knew, but whether north,\nsouth, east, or west I had no idea. For that mat-\nter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were\nwithin that radius, so the place might not be so\nsecluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from\nthe absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune\nunder my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling\nthat I was thoroughly earning my \ufb01fty-guinea fee. \u201cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in\nthe midst of the utter stillness, the door of my\nroom swung slowly open. The woman was stand-\ning in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind\nher, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon\nher eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance\nthat she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\nchill to my own heart. She held up one shaking\n\ufb01nger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few\nwhispered words of broken English at me, her eyes\nglancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into\nthe gloom behind her."

Why should I slink\naway without having carried out my commission,\nand without the payment which was my due? This\nwoman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her man-\nner had shaken me more than I cared to confess,\nI still shook my head and declared my intention\nof remaining where I was. She was about to re-\nnew her entreaties when a door slammed over-\nhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard\nupon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw\nup her hands with a despairing gesture, and van-\nished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had\ncome. \u201cThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark\nand a short thick man with a chinchilla beard\ngrowing out of the creases of his double chin, who\nwas introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson. \u201c \u2018This is my secretary and manager,\u2019 said the\ncolonel. \u2018By the way, I was under the impression\nthat I left this door shut just now. I fear that you\nhave felt the draught.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018On the contrary,\u2019 said I, \u2018I opened the door\nmyself because I felt the room to be a little close.\u2019\n\u201cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \u2018Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,\u2019\nsaid he. \u2018Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to\nsee the machine.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Oh, no, it is in the house.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018What, you dig fuller\u2019s-earth in the house?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to\nexamine the machine and to let us know what is\nwrong with it.\u2019\n\u201cWe went upstairs together, the colonel \ufb01rst\nwith the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corri-\ndors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and lit-\ntle low doors, the thresholds of which were hol-\nlowed out by the generations who had crossed\nthem."

I\ntried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible,\nbut I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady,\neven though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen\neye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared\nto be a morose and silent man, but I could see from\nthe little that he said that he was at least a fellow-\ncountryman. \u201cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before\na low door, which he unlocked. Within was a\nsmall, square room, in which the three of us could\nhardly get at one time. Ferguson remained out-\nside, and the colonel ushered me in. \u201c \u2018We are now,\u2019 said he, \u2018actually within the hy-\ndraulic press, and it would be a particularly un-\npleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end\nof the descending piston, and it comes down with\nthe force of many tons upon this metal \ufb02oor. There\nare small lateral columns of water outside which\nreceive the force, and which transmit and multi-\nply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The\nmachine goes readily enough, but there is some\nstiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\nof its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness\nto look it over and to show us how we can set it\nright.\u2019\n\u201cI took the lamp from him, and I examined\nthe machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gi-\ngantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\npressure. When I passed outside, however, and\npressed down the levers which controlled it, I\nknew at once by the whishing sound that there\nwas a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgita-\ntion of water through one of the side cylinders. An\nexamination showed that one of the india-rubber\nbands which was round the head of a driving-rod\nhad shrunk so as not quite to \ufb01ll the socket along\nwhich it worked. This was clearly the cause of the\nloss of power, and I pointed it out to my compan-\nions, who followed my remarks very carefully and\nasked several practical questions as to how they\nshould proceed to set it right. When I had made\nit clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of\nthe machine and took a good look at it to satisfy\n232\nThe Adventure of the Engineer\u2019s Thumb\nmy own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that\nthe story of the fuller\u2019s-earth was the merest fab-\nrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so\npowerful an engine could be designed for so inad-\nequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the\n\ufb02oor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I\ncame to examine it I could see a crust of metallic\ndeposit all over it."

Let me out!\u2019\n\u201cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a\nsound which sent my heart into my mouth. It\nwas the clank of the levers and the swish of the\nleaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the \ufb02oor where I had\nplaced it when examining the trough. By its light\nI saw that the black ceiling was coming down\nupon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew bet-\nter than myself, with a force which must within\na minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw\nmyself, screaming, against the door, and dragged\nwith my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel\nto let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\nlevers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a\nfoot or two above my head, and with my hand up-\nraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then\nit \ufb02ashed through my mind that the pain of my\ndeath would depend very much upon the position\nin which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight\nwould come upon my spine, and I shuddered to\nthink of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way,\nperhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up\nat that deadly black shadow wavering down upon\nme? Already I was unable to stand erect, when\nmy eye caught something which brought a gush\nof hope back to my heart. \u201cI have said that though the \ufb02oor and ceiling\nwere of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a\nlast hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yel-\nlow light between two of the boards, which broad-\nened and broadened as a small panel was pushed\nbackward. For an instant I could hardly believe\nthat here was indeed a door which led away from\ndeath. The next instant I threw myself through,\nand lay half-fainting upon the other side."

Sud-\ndenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and\nsickness came over me. I glanced down at my\nhand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for\nthe \ufb01rst time, saw that my thumb had been cut off\nand that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it,\nbut there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and\nnext moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-\nbushes. \u201cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot\ntell. It must have been a very long time, for\nthe moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\nbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes\nwere all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was\ndrenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the par-\nticulars of my night\u2019s adventure, and I sprang to\nmy feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be\nsafe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment,\nwhen I came to look round me, neither house nor\ngarden were to be seen. I had been lying in an an-\ngle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just\na little lower down was a long building, which\nproved, upon my approaching it, to be the very\nstation at which I had arrived upon the previous\nnight. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my\nhand, all that had passed during those dreadful\nhours might have been an evil dream. \u201cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked\nabout the morning train.

Left his lodgings at ten o\u2019clock at\nnight, and has not been heard of since. Was\ndressed in\u2014\u2019\netc., etc. Ha!

About sunset, however, their ef-\nforts were at last successful, and they subdued\nthe \ufb02ames, but not before the roof had fallen in,\nand the whole place been reduced to such abso-\nlute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\niron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery\nwhich had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so\ndearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were dis-\ncovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were\nto be found, which may have explained the pres-\nence of those bulky boxes which have been already\nreferred to. How our hydraulic engineer had been con-\nveyed from the garden to the spot where he re-\ncovered his senses might have remained forever a\nmystery were it not for the soft mould, which told\nus a very plain tale. He had evidently been car-\nried down by two persons, one of whom had re-\nmarkably small feet and the other unusually large\nones. On the whole, it was most probable that the\nsilent Englishman, being less bold or less murder-\nous than his companion, had assisted the woman\nto bear the unconscious man out of the way of dan-\nger. \u201cWell,\u201d said our engineer ruefully as we took\nour seats to return once more to London, \u201cit has\nbeen a pretty business for me! I have lost my\nthumb and I have lost a \ufb01fty-guinea fee, and what\nhave I gained?\u201d\n\u201cExperience,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cIndi-\nrectly it may be of value, you know; you have only\nto put it into words to gain the reputation of be-\ning excellent company for the remainder of your\nexistence.\u201d\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\nT\nhe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its cu-\nrious termination, have long ceased to\nbe a subject of interest in those exalted\ncircles in which the unfortunate bride-\ngroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and\ntheir more piquant details have drawn the gos-\nsips away from this four-year-old drama. As I\nhave reason to believe, however, that the full facts\nhave never been revealed to the general public, and\nas my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable\nshare in clearing the matter up, I feel that no mem-\noir of him would be complete without some little\nsketch of this remarkable episode."

I had remained indoors all day,\nfor the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain,\nwith high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet\nwhich I had brought back in one of my limbs as a\nrelic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull\npersistence. With my body in one easy-chair and\nmy legs upon another, I had surrounded myself\nwith a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated\nwith the news of the day, I tossed them all aside\nand lay listless, watching the huge crest and mono-\ngram upon the envelope upon the table and won-\ndering lazily who my friend\u2019s noble correspondent\ncould be. \u201cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\u201d I remarked\nas he entered. \u201cYour morning letters, if I remem-\nber right, were from a \ufb01sh-monger and a tide-\nwaiter.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my correspondence has certainly the\ncharm of variety,\u201d he answered, smiling, \u201cand the\nhumbler are usually the more interesting. This\nlooks like one of those unwelcome social sum-\nmonses which call upon a man either to be bored\nor to lie.\u201d\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the con-\ntents. \u201cOh, come, it may prove to be something of in-\nterest, after all.\u201d\n\u201cNot social, then?\u201d\n\u201cNo, distinctly professional.\u201d\n\u201cAnd from a noble client?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the highest in England.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\u201d\n\u201cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that\nthe status of my client is a matter of less moment\nto me than the interest of his case. It is just possi-\nble, however, that that also may not be wanting in\nthis new investigation. You have been reading the\npapers diligently of late, have you not?\u201d\n\u201cIt looks like it,\u201d said I ruefully, pointing to a\nhuge bundle in the corner. \u201cI have had nothing\nelse to do.\u201d\n\u201cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able\nto post me up. I read nothing except the criminal\nnews and the agony column. The latter is always\ninstructive. But if you have followed recent events\nso closely you must have read about Lord St. Si-\nmon and his wedding?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, with the deepest interest.\u201d\n\u201cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my\nhand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you,\nand in return you must turn over these papers and\nlet me have whatever bears upon the matter. This\nis what he says:\n\u201c \u2018My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:\n\u201c \u2018Lord Backwater tells me that I may\nplace implicit reliance upon your judg-\nment and discretion. I have deter-\nmined, therefore, to call upon you and\nto consult you in reference to the very\npainful event which has occurred in\nconnection with my wedding. Mr.\nLestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting\nalready in the matter, but he assures\nme that he sees no objection to your\nco-operation, and that he even thinks\nthat it might be of some assistance."

        "text": "An\nimportant addition has been made during\nthe last week to the list of the prizes which\nhave been borne away by these charming\ninvaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown\nhimself for over twenty years proof against\nthe little god\u2019s arrows, has now de\ufb01nitely\nannounced his approaching marriage with\nMiss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daugh-\nter of a California millionaire. Miss Do-\nran, whose graceful \ufb01gure and striking face\nattracted much attention at the Westbury\nHouse festivities, is an only child, and it is\ncurrently reported that her dowry will run\nto considerably over the six \ufb01gures, with\nexpectancies for the future. As it is an open\nsecret that the Duke of Balmoral has been\ncompelled to sell his pictures within the last\nfew years, and as Lord St. Simon has no\nproperty of his own save the small estate\nof Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Califor-\nnian heiress is not the only gainer by an\nalliance which will enable her to make the\neasy and common transition from a Repub-\nlican lady to a British peeress.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked Holmes, yawning. \u201cOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in\nthe Morning Post to say that the marriage would\nbe an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St.\nGeorge\u2019s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen\nintimate friends would be invited, and that the\nparty would return to the furnished house at Lan-\ncaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius\nDoran. Two days later\u2014that is, on Wednesday\nlast\u2014there is a curt announcement that the wed-\nding had taken place, and that the honeymoon\nwould be passed at Lord Backwater\u2019s place, near\nPeters\ufb01eld. Those are all the notices which ap-\npeared before the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\n\u201cBefore the what?\u201d asked Holmes with a start. \u201cThe vanishing of the lady.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did she vanish, then?\u201d\n\u201cAt the wedding breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. This is more interesting than it\npromised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the\ncommon.\u201d\n\u201cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and\noccasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot\ncall to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray\nlet me have the details.\u201d\n\u201cI warn you that they are very incomplete.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps we may make them less so.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a sin-\ngle article of a morning paper of yesterday, which\nI will read to you. It is headed, \u2018Singular Occur-\nrence at a Fashionable Wedding\u2019:\n240\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\n\u201c \u2018The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has\nbeen thrown into the greatest consterna-\ntion by the strange and painful episodes\nwhich have taken place in connection with\nhis wedding. The ceremony, as shortly\nannounced in the papers of yesterday, oc-\ncurred on the previous morning; but it is\nonly now that it has been possible to con-\n\ufb01rm the strange rumours which have been\nso persistently \ufb02oating about. In spite of\nthe attempts of the friends to hush the mat-\nter up, so much public attention has now\nbeen drawn to it that no good purpose can\nbe served by affecting to disregard what is\na common subject for conversation."

The\nwhole party proceeded afterwards to the\nhouse of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster\nGate, where breakfast had been prepared. It\nappears that some little trouble was caused\nby a woman, whose name has not been\nascertained, who endeavoured to force her\nway into the house after the bridal party,\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord\nSt. Simon. It was only after a painful\nand prolonged scene that she was ejected\nby the butler and the footman. The bride,\nwho had fortunately entered the house be-\nfore this unpleasant interruption, had sat\ndown to breakfast with the rest, when she\ncomplained of a sudden indisposition and\nretired to her room. Her prolonged absence\nhaving caused some comment, her father\nfollowed her, but learned from her maid that\nshe had only come up to her chamber for\nan instant, caught up an ulster and bon-\nnet, and hurried down to the passage. One\nof the footmen declared that he had seen a\nlady leave the house thus apparelled, but\nhad refused to credit that it was his mis-\ntress, believing her to be with the com-\npany. On ascertaining that his daughter\nhad disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in\nconjunction with the bridegroom, instantly\nput themselves in communication with the\npolice, and very energetic inquiries are be-\ning made, which will probably result in\na speedy clearing up of this very singu-\nlar business. Up to a late hour last night,\nhowever, nothing had transpired as to the\nwhereabouts of the missing lady. There are\nrumours of foul play in the matter, and it is\nsaid that the police have caused the arrest of\nthe woman who had caused the original dis-\nturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or\nsome other motive, she may have been con-\ncerned in the strange disappearance of the\nbride.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cAnd is that all?\u201d\n\u201cOnly one little item in another of the morning\npapers, but it is a suggestive one.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had\ncaused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the\nAllegro, and that she has known the bridegroom\nfor some years. There are no further particulars,\nand the whole case is in your hands now\u2014so far\nas it has been set forth in the public press.\u201d\n\u201cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears\nto be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But\nthere is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock\nmakes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt\nthat this will prove to be our noble client. Do not\ndream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer\nhaving a witness, if only as a check to my own\nmemory.\u201d\n\u201cLord Robert St. Simon,\u201d announced our page-\nboy, throwing open the door."

She is what we call in England a tomboy, with\na strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any\nsort of traditions. She is impetuous\u2014volcanic, I\nwas about to say.

And she was afterwards seen walk-\ning into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar,\na woman who is now in custody, and who had\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\u2019s house\nthat morning.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes.

She used to be at the Allegro. I\nhave not treated her ungenerously, and she had no\njust cause of complaint against me, but you know\nwhat women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear\nlittle thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devot-\nedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters\nwhen she heard that I was about to be married,\nand, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the\nmarriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared\nlest there might be a scandal in the church. She\ncame to Mr. Doran\u2019s door just after we returned,\nand she endeavoured to push her way in, utter-\ning very abusive expressions towards my wife, and\neven threatening her, but I had foreseen the possi-\nbility of something of the sort, and I had two police\nfellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed\nher out again."

That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland\nYard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that\nFlora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible\ntrap for her.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is a possible supposition.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so, too?\u201d\n\u201cI did not say a probable one.

Since\nyou ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred\nto me as possible that the excitement of this affair,\nthe consciousness that she had made so immense\na social stride, had the effect of causing some little\nnervous disturbance in my wife.\u201d\n\u201cIn short, that she had become suddenly de-\nranged?\u201d\n\u201cWell, really, when I consider that she has\nturned her back\u2014I will not say upon me, but upon\nso much that many have aspired to without suc-\ncess\u2014I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\u201d\n\u201cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hy-\npothesis,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cAnd now, Lord\nSt. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my\ndata.

What was that?\u201d\n\u201cI say that I have solved it.\u201d\n\u201cWhere, then, is my wife?\u201d\n\u201cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\u201d\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \u201cI am\nafraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or\nmine,\u201d he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-\nfashioned manner he departed. \u201cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my\nhead by putting it on a level with his own,\u201d said\nSherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cI think that I shall\nhave a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this\ncross-questioning.

My whole examination served to turn\nmy conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial ev-\nidence is occasionally very convincing, as when\nyou \ufb01nd a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\u2019s\nexample.\u201d\n\u201cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\u201d\n\u201cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-\nexisting cases which serves me so well."

They have been identi\ufb01ed as\nher clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes\nwere there the body would not be far off.\u201d\n\u201cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\u2019s\nbody is to be found in the neighbourhood of his\nwardrobe.

Frank had\nbeen a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped,\ncame on to \u2019Frisco, found that I had given him up\nfor dead and had gone to England, followed me\nthere, and had come upon me at last on the very\nmorning of my second wedding.\u201d\n\u201cI saw it in a paper,\u201d explained the American. \u201cIt gave the name and the church but not where\nthe lady lived.\u201d\n\u201cThen we had a talk as to what we should\ndo, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so\nashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to van-\nish away and never see any of them again\u2014just\nsending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that\nI was alive.

Obviously something had oc-\ncurred during the morning, then, to cause her to\nchange her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she\nwas out, for she had been in the company of the\nbridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she\nhad, it must be someone from America because\nshe had spent so short a time in this country that\nshe could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire\nso deep an in\ufb02uence over her that the mere sight of\nhim would induce her to change her plans so com-\npletely. You see we have already arrived, by a pro-\ncess of exclusion, at the idea that she might have\nseen an American.

She had gone off with a man, and\nthe man was either a lover or was a previous hus-\nband\u2014the chances being in favour of the latter.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how in the world did you \ufb01nd them?\u201d\n\u201cIt\nmight\nhave\nbeen\ndif\ufb01cult,\nbut\nfriend\nLestrade held information in his hands the value\nof which he did not himself know."

What could have happened, then, to bring one\nof the foremost citizens of London to this most\npitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with\nanother effort he braced himself to tell his story. \u201cI feel that time is of value,\u201d said he; \u201cthat is\nwhy I hastened here when the police inspector\nsuggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and\nhurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly\nthrough this snow. That is why I was so out of\nbreath, for I am a man who takes very little ex-\nercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts\nbefore you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can. \u201cIt is, of course, well known to you that in\na successful banking business as much depends\n251\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\nupon our being able to \ufb01nd remunerative invest-\nments for our funds as upon our increasing our\nconnection and the number of our depositors. One\nof our most lucrative means of laying out money is\nin the shape of loans, where the security is unim-\npeachable. We have done a good deal in this direc-\ntion during the last few years, and there are many\nnoble families to whom we have advanced large\nsums upon the security of their pictures, libraries,\nor plate. \u201cYesterday morning I was seated in my of\ufb01ce\nat the bank when a card was brought in to me by\none of the clerks.

I could, of course,\nborrow so tri\ufb02ing a sum ten times over from my\nfriends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of\nbusiness and to carry out that business myself. In\nmy position you can readily understand that it is\nunwise to place one\u2019s self under obligations.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018For how long, may I ask, do you want this\nsum?\u2019 I asked. \u201c \u2018Next Monday I have a large sum due to me,\nand I shall then most certainly repay what you ad-\nvance, with whatever interest you think it right\nto charge."

Any injury to it would be almost as se-\nrious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in\nthe world to match these, and it would be impos-\nsible to replace them.

However, it\nwas too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it\nup in my private safe and turned once more to my\nwork. \u201cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an\nimprudence to leave so precious a thing in the of-\n\ufb01ce behind me. Bankers\u2019 safes had been forced\nbefore now, and why should not mine be? If\nso, how terrible would be the position in which\n252\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\nI should \ufb01nd myself! I determined, therefore, that\nfor the next few days I would always carry the case\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might\nnever be really out of my reach. With this inten-\ntion, I called a cab and drove out to my house\nat Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did\nnot breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and\nlocked it in the bureau of my dressing-room. \u201cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr.\nHolmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand\nthe situation. My groom and my page sleep out\nof the house, and may be set aside altogether. I\nhave three maid-servants who have been with me\na number of years and whose absolute reliability\nis quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the\nsecond waiting-maid, has only been in my service\na few months. She came with an excellent charac-\nter, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers\nwho have occasionally hung about the place. That\nis the only drawback which we have found to her,\nbut we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in\nevery way. \u201cSo much for the servants. My family itself is\nso small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He\nhas been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\u2014a\ngrievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I\nam myself to blame. People tell me that I have\nspoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear\nwife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could\nnot bear to see the smile fade even for a moment\nfrom his face. I have never denied him a wish. Per-\nhaps it would have been better for both of us had\nI been sterner, but I meant it for the best. \u201cIt was naturally my intention that he should\nsucceed me in my business, but he was not of a\nbusiness turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to\nspeak the truth, I could not trust him in the han-\ndling of large sums of money. When he was young\nhe became a member of an aristocratic club, and\nthere, having charming manners, he was soon the\nintimate of a number of men with long purses and\nexpensive habits. He learned to play heavily at\ncards and to squander money on the turf, until he\nhad again and again to come to me and implore\nme to give him an advance upon his allowance,\nthat he might settle his debts of honour."

He\nmight avert it all if he would but tell me what he\nhad done with the three missing stones. \u201c \u2018You may as well face the matter,\u2019 said I;\n\u2018you have been caught in the act, and no confes-\nsion could make your guilt more heinous. If you\nbut make such reparation as is in your power, by\ntelling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven\nand forgotten.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for\nit,\u2019 he answered, turning away from me with a\nsneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any\nwords of mine to in\ufb02uence him. There was but\none way for it. I called in the inspector and gave\nhim into custody. A search was made at once not\nonly of his person but of his room and of every\nportion of the house where he could possibly have\nconcealed the gems; but no trace of them could\nbe found, nor would the wretched boy open his\nmouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, af-\nter going through all the police formalities, have\nhurried round to you to implore you to use your\nskill in unravelling the matter. The police have\nopenly confessed that they can at present make\nnothing of it. You may go to any expense which\nyou think necessary. I have already offered a re-\nward of \u00a31000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost\nmy honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\u201d\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and\nrocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like\na child whose grief has got beyond words. Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few min-\nutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes \ufb01xed\nupon the \ufb01re. \u201cDo you receive much company?\u201d he asked. \u201cNone save my partner with his family and an\noccasional friend of Arthur\u2019s. Sir George Burnwell\nhas been several times lately. No one else, I think.\u201d\n\u201cDo you go out much in society?\u201d\n\u201cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We\nneither of us care for it.\u201d\n\u201cThat is unusual in a young girl.\u201d\n\u201cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so\nvery young. She is four-and-twenty.\u201d\n\u201cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have\nbeen a shock to her also.\u201d\n\u201cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.\u201d\n\u201cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your\nson\u2019s guilt?\u201d\n\u201cHow can we have when I saw him with my\nown eyes with the coronet in his hands.\u201d\n\u201cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was\nthe remainder of the coronet at all injured?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was twisted.\u201d\n\u201cDo you not think, then, that he might have\nbeen trying to straighten it?\u201d\n\u201cGod bless you!"

If his purpose\nwere innocent, why did he not say so?\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he\nnot invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut\nboth ways. There are several singular points about\nthe case. What did the police think of the noise\nwhich awoke you from your sleep?\u201d\n\u201cThey considered that it might be caused by\nArthur\u2019s closing his bedroom door.\u201d\n\u201cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony\nwould slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\nthese gems?\u201d\n\u201cThey are still sounding the planking and\nprobing the furniture in the hope of \ufb01nding them.\u201d\n\u201cHave they thought of looking outside the\nhouse?\u201d\n\u201cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely ex-\namined.\u201d\n\u201cNow, my dear sir,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cis it not\nobvious to you now that this matter really strikes\nvery much deeper than either you or the police\nwere at \ufb01rst inclined to think? It appeared to you\nto be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly\ncomplex. Consider what is involved by your the-\nory. You suppose that your son came down from\nhis bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,\nopened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke\noff by main force a small portion of it, went off\n255\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\nto some other place, concealed three gems out of\nthe thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can\n\ufb01nd them, and then returned with the other thirty-\nsix into the room in which he exposed himself to\nthe greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you\nnow, is such a theory tenable?\u201d\n\u201cBut what other is there?\u201d cried the banker\nwith a gesture of despair. \u201cIf his motives were in-\nnocent, why does he not explain them?\u201d\n\u201cIt is our task to \ufb01nd that out,\u201d replied Holmes;\n\u201cso now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set\noff for Streatham together, and devote an hour to\nglancing a little more closely into details.\u201d\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying\nthem in their expedition,\nwhich I was eager\nenough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were\ndeeply stirred by the story to which we had lis-\ntened. I confess that the guilt of the banker\u2019s\nson appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to\nhis unhappy father, but still I had such faith in\nHolmes\u2019 judgment that I felt that there must be\nsome grounds for hope as long as he was dissat-\nis\ufb01ed with the accepted explanation. He hardly\nspoke a word the whole way out to the southern\nsuburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and\nhis hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest\nthought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh\nheart at the little glimpse of hope which had been\npresented to him, and he even broke into a desul-\ntory chat with me over his business affairs."

Fairbank was a good-sized square house of\nwhite stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\nstretched down in front to two large iron gates\nwhich closed the entrance. On the right side was\na small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow\npath between two neat hedges stretching from the\nroad to the kitchen door, and forming the trades-\nmen\u2019s entrance. On the left ran a lane which\nled to the stables, and was not itself within the\ngrounds at all, being a public, though little used,\nthoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door\nand walked slowly all round the house, across the\nfront, down the tradesmen\u2019s path, and so round by\nthe garden behind into the stable lane. So long was\nhe that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room\nand waited by the \ufb01re until he should return. We\nwere sitting there in silence when the door opened\nand a young lady came in. She was rather above\nthe middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\nwhich seemed the darker against the absolute pal-\nlor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen\nsuch deadly paleness in a woman\u2019s face. Her lips,\ntoo, were bloodless, but her eyes were \ufb02ushed with\ncrying. As she swept silently into the room she\nimpressed me with a greater sense of grief than\nthe banker had done in the morning, and it was\nthe more striking in her as she was evidently a\nwoman of strong character, with immense capac-\nity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence,\nshe went straight to her uncle and passed her hand\nover his head with a sweet womanly caress. \u201cYou have given orders that Arthur should be\nliberated, have you not, dad?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to\nthe bottom.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know\nwhat woman\u2019s instincts are. I know that he has\ndone no harm and that you will be sorry for hav-\ning acted so harshly.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so an-\ngry that you should suspect him.\u201d\n\u201cHow could I help suspecting him, when I ac-\ntually saw him with the coronet in his hand?\u201d\n\u201cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at\nit. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is inno-\ncent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so\ndreadful to think of our dear Arthur in a prison!\u201d\n\u201cI shall never let it drop until the gems are\nfound\u2014never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur\nblinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gen-\ntleman down from London to inquire more deeply\ninto it.\u201d\n\u201cThis gentleman?\u201d she asked, facing round to\nme."

I saw the\nman, too, in the gloom.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our\nvegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.\u201d\n\u201cHe stood,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cto the left of the\ndoor\u2014that is to say, farther up the path than is\nnecessary to reach the door?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\u201d\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young\nlady\u2019s expressive black eyes. \u201cWhy, you are like\na magician,\u201d said she. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in\nHolmes\u2019 thin, eager face. \u201cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cI shall probably wish to go over the outside of\nthe house again. Perhaps I had better take a look\nat the lower windows before I go up.\u201d\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other,\npausing only at the large one which looked from\nthe hall onto the stable lane.

The banker\u2019s dressing-room was a plainly fur-\nnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large\nbureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\nbureau \ufb01rst and looked hard at the lock. \u201cWhich key was used to open it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat which my son himself indicated\u2014that of\nthe cupboard of the lumber-room.\u201d\n\u201cHave you it here?\u201d\n\u201cThat is it on the dressing-table.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bu-\nreau. \u201cIt is a noiseless lock,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is no won-\nder that it did not wake you.

We have certainly been favoured\nwith extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it\nwill be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed\nin clearing the matter up. With your permission,\nMr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations\noutside.\u201d\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he\nexplained that any unnecessary footmarks might\n257\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\nmake his task more dif\ufb01cult.

Your niece, when you had, as\nshe thought, gone to your room, slipped down\nand talked to her lover through the window which\nleads into the stable lane. His footmarks had\npressed right through the snow, so long had he\nstood there. She told him of the coronet. His\nwicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he\nbent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved\nyou, but there are women in whom the love of a\n259\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\nlover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that\nshe must have been one. She had hardly listened to\nhis instructions when she saw you coming down-\nstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly\nand told you about one of the servants\u2019 escapade\nwith her wooden-legged lover, which was all per-\nfectly true. \u201cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his inter-\nview with you but he slept badly on account of\nhis uneasiness about his club debts. In the mid-\ndle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his\ndoor, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised\nto see his cousin walking very stealthily along the\npassage until she disappeared into your dressing-\nroom. Petri\ufb01ed with astonishment, the lad slipped\non some clothes and waited there in the dark to see\nwhat would come of this strange affair. Presently\nshe emerged from the room again, and in the light\nof the passage-lamp your son saw that she car-\nried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed\ndown the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran\nalong and slipped behind the curtain near your\ndoor, whence he could see what passed in the hall\nbeneath. He saw her stealthily open the window,\nhand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and\nthen closing it once more hurry back to her room,\npassing quite close to where he stood hid behind\nthe curtain. \u201cAs long as she was on the scene he could not\ntake any action without a horrible exposure of the\nwoman whom he loved. But the instant that she\nwas gone he realised how crushing a misfortune\nthis would be for you, and how all-important it\nwas to set it right. He rushed down, just as he\nwas, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang\nout into the snow, and ran down the lane, where\nhe could see a dark \ufb01gure in the moonlight. Sir\nGeorge Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur\ncaught him, and there was a struggle between\nthem, your lad tugging at one side of the coro-\nnet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuf\ufb02e,\nyour son struck Sir George and cut him over the\neye."

He could not explain\nthe true state of affairs without betraying one who\ncertainly deserved little enough consideration at\nhis hands. He took the more chivalrous view, how-\never, and preserved her secret.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted\nwhen she saw the coronet,\u201d cried Mr. Holder. \u201cOh,\nmy God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\nasking to be allowed to go out for \ufb01ve minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece\nwere at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I\nhave misjudged him!\u201d\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the house,\u201d continued\nHolmes, \u201cI at once went very carefully round it to\nobserve if there were any traces in the snow which\nmight help me. I knew that none had fallen since\nthe evening before, and also that there had been\na strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed\nalong the tradesmen\u2019s path, but found it all tram-\npled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,\nhowever, at the far side of the kitchen door, a\nwoman had stood and talked with a man, whose\nround impressions on one side showed that he had\na wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been\ndisturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to\nthe door, as was shown by the deep toe and light\nheel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little,\nand then had gone away. I thought at the time\nthat this might be the maid and her sweetheart,\nof whom you had already spoken to me, and in-\nquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden\nwithout seeing anything more than random tracks,\nwhich I took to be the police; but when I got into\nthe stable lane a very long and complex story was\nwritten in the snow in front of me. \u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted\nman, and a second double line which I saw with\ndelight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was\nat once convinced from what you had told me that\nthe latter was your son. The \ufb01rst had walked both\nways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his\ntread was marked in places over the depression\nof the boot, it was obvious that he had passed af-\nter the other. I followed them up and found they\nled to the hall window, where Boots had worn\nall the snow away while waiting. Then I walked\nto the other end, which was a hundred yards or\nmore down the lane."

Boots had then run down the lane,\nand another little smudge of blood showed that it\nwas he who had been hurt. When he came to the\nhighroad at the other end, I found that the pave-\nment had been cleared, so there was an end to that\nclue. 260\n\u201cOn entering the house, however, I examined,\nas you remember, the sill and framework of the\nhall window with my lens, and I could at once\nsee that someone had passed out. I could distin-\nguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot\nhad been placed in coming in. I was then begin-\nning to be able to form an opinion as to what had\noccurred. A man had waited outside the window;\nsomeone had brought the gems; the deed had been\noverseen by your son; he had pursued the thief;\nhad struggled with him; they had each tugged at\nthe coronet, their united strength causing injuries\nwhich neither alone could have effected. He had\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in\nthe grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The\nquestion now was, who was the man and who was\nit brought him the coronet? \u201cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have\nexcluded the impossible, whatever remains, how-\never improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so\nthere only remained your niece and the maids. But\nif it were the maids, why should your son allow\nhimself to be accused in their place? There could\nbe no possible reason. As he loved his cousin,\nhowever, there was an excellent explanation why\nhe should retain her secret\u2014the more so as the se-\ncret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered\nthat you had seen her at that window, and how\nshe had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\nconjecture became a certainty. \u201cAnd who could it be who was her confeder-\nate? A lover evidently, for who else could out-\nweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel\nto you? I knew that you went out little, and that\nyour circle of friends was a very limited one. But\namong them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard\nof him before as being a man of evil reputation\namong women. It must have been he who wore\nthose boots and retained the missing gems. Even\nthough he knew that Arthur had discovered him,\nhe might still \ufb02atter himself that he was safe, for\nthe lad could not say a word without compromis-\ning his own family. \u201cWell, your own good sense will suggest what\nmeasures I took next. I went in the shape of a\nloafer to Sir George\u2019s house, managed to pick up\nan acquaintance with his valet, learned that his\nmaster had cut his head the night before, and, \ufb01-\nnally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure\nby buying a pair of his cast-off shoes."

It was\na delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw\nthat a prosecution must be avoided to avert scan-\ndal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see\nthat our hands were tied in the matter. I went and\nsaw him. At \ufb01rst, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had oc-\ncurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-\npreserver from the wall. I knew my man, however,\nand I clapped a pistol to his head before he could\nstrike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I\ntold him that we would give him a price for the\nstones he held\u2014\u00a31000 apiece.

I have it here and I will read it to\nyou:\n\u201c \u2018The Copper Beeches, near Winchester. \u201c \u2018Dear Miss Hunter:\n\u201c \u2018Miss Stoper has very kindly given\nme your address, and I write from here\nto ask you whether you have reconsid-\nered your decision. My wife is very\nanxious that you should come, for she\nhas been much attracted by my de-\nscription of you. We are willing to\ngive \u00a330 a quarter, or \u00a3120 a year, so\nas to recompense you for any little in-\nconvenience which our fads may cause\nyou. They are not very exacting, af-\nter all. My wife is fond of a particular\n267\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches\nshade of electric blue and would like\nyou to wear such a dress indoors in\nthe morning. You need not, however,\ngo to the expense of purchasing one,\nas we have one belonging to my dear\ndaughter Alice (now in Philadelphia),\nwhich would, I should think, \ufb01t you\nvery well. Then, as to sitting here or\nthere, or amusing yourself in any man-\nner indicated, that need cause you no\ninconvenience. As regards your hair,\nit is no doubt a pity, especially as I\ncould not help remarking its beauty\nduring our short interview, but I am\nafraid that I must remain \ufb01rm upon\nthis point, and I only hope that the\nincreased salary may recompense you\nfor the loss. Your duties, as far as the\nchild is concerned, are very light. Now\ndo try to come, and I shall meet you\nwith the dog-cart at Winchester. Let\nme know your train. \u201c \u2018Yours faithfully,\n\u201c \u2018Jephro Rucastle.\u2019\n\u201cThat is the letter which I have just received,\nMr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will\naccept it. I thought, however, that before taking the\n\ufb01nal step I should like to submit the whole matter\nto your consideration.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up,\nthat settles the question,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\u201d\n\u201cI confess that it is not the situation which I\nshould like to see a sister of mine apply for.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cAh, I have no data."

Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very\nkind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his\nwife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter\nquiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum,\nand that he humours her fancies in every way in\norder to prevent an outbreak?\u201d\n\u201cThat is a possible solution\u2014in fact, as matters\nstand, it is the most probable one.

I assure you that your little problem promises to\nbe the most interesting which has come my way\nfor some months. There is something distinctly\nnovel about some of the features.

I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at\nonce, sacri\ufb01ce my poor hair to-night, and start for\nWinchester to-morrow.\u201d With a few grateful words\nto Holmes she bade us both good-night and bus-\ntled off upon her way. \u201cAt least,\u201d said I as we heard her quick, \ufb01rm\nsteps descending the stairs, \u201cshe seems to be a\nyoung lady who is very well able to take care of\nherself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she would need to be,\u201d said Holmes\ngravely. \u201cI am much mistaken if we do not hear\nfrom her before many days are past.\u201d\nIt was not very long before my friend\u2019s pre-\ndiction was ful\ufb01lled. A fortnight went by, dur-\ning which I frequently found my thoughts turn-\ning in her direction and wondering what strange\nside-alley of human experience this lonely woman\nhad strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious\nconditions, the light duties, all pointed to some-\nthing abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot,\nor whether the man were a philanthropist or a vil-\nlain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for\nhalf an hour on end, with knitted brows and an\nabstracted air, but he swept the matter away with\na wave of his hand when I mentioned it."

But Holmes shook his head gravely. \u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat it is one\nof the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I\nmust look at everything with reference to my own\nspecial subject. You look at these scattered houses,\nand you are impressed by their beauty. I look at\nthem, and the only thought which comes to me\nis a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity\nwith which crime may be committed there.\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cWho would asso-\nciate crime with these dear old homesteads?\u201d\n\u201cThey always \ufb01ll me with a certain horror. It is\nmy belief, Watson, founded upon my experience,\nthat the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not\npresent a more dreadful record of sin than does\nthe smiling and beautiful countryside.\u201d\n\u201cYou horrify me!\u201d\n\u201cBut the reason is very obvious."

There are grounds round it, woods on\nthree sides, and on the fourth a \ufb01eld which slopes\ndown to the Southampton highroad, which curves\npast about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the\nwoods all round are part of Lord Southerton\u2019s pre-\nserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in\nfront of the hall door has given its name to the\nplace. \u201cI was driven over by my employer, who was\nas amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that\nevening to his wife and the child. There was no\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed\nto us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent,\npale-faced woman, much younger than her hus-\nband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he\ncan hardly be less than forty-\ufb01ve. From their con-\nversation I have gathered that they have been mar-\nried about seven years, that he was a widower, and\nthat his only child by the \ufb01rst wife was the daugh-\nter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle\ntold me in private that the reason why she had left\nthem was that she had an unreasoning aversion to\nher stepmother. As the daughter could not have\nbeen less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her\nposition must have been uncomfortable with her\nfather\u2019s young wife. \u201cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in\nmind as well as in feature. She impressed me nei-\nther favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonen-\ntity. It was easy to see that she was passionately\ndevoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from\none to the other, noting every little want and fore-\nstalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his\nbluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they\nseemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had\nsome secret sorrow, this woman. She would of-\nten be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look\nupon her face. More than once I have surprised\nher in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was\nthe disposition of her child which weighed upon\nher mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled\nand so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for\nhis age, with a head which is quite disproportion-\nately large. His whole life appears to be spent in\nan alternation between savage \ufb01ts of passion and\ngloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any\ncreature weaker than himself seems to be his one\nidea of amusement, and he shows quite remark-\nable talent in planning the capture of mice, little\nbirds, and insects."

The one unpleasant thing about the house, which\nstruck me at once, was the appearance and con-\nduct of the servants. There are only two, a man\nand his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,\nuncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers,\nand a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\nbeen with them he has been quite drunk, and yet\nMr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His\nwife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour\nface, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less ami-\nable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but for-\ntunately I spend most of my time in the nursery\nand my own room, which are next to each other in\none corner of the building. \u201cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper\nBeeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs.\nRucastle came down just after breakfast and whis-\npered something to her husband. \u201c \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, turning to me, \u2018we are very\nmuch obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in\nwith our whims so far as to cut your hair. I as-\nsure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota\nfrom your appearance. We shall now see how the\nelectric-blue dress will become you. You will \ufb01nd\nit laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\nwould be so good as to put it on we should both\nbe extremely obliged.\u2019\n\u201cThe dress which I found waiting for me was\nof a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent\nmaterial, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable\nsigns of having been worn before. It could not\nhave been a better \ufb01t if I had been measured for\nit. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight\nat the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\nin its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the\n270\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches\ndrawing-room, which is a very large room, stretch-\ning along the entire front of the house, with three\nlong windows reaching down to the \ufb02oor. A chair\nhad been placed close to the central window, with\nits back turned towards it. In this I was asked to\nsit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down\non the other side of the room, began to tell me a se-\nries of the funniest stories that I have ever listened\nto. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and\nI laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle,\nhowever, who has evidently no sense of humour,\nnever so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in\nher lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face."

Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the win-\ndow, and again I laughed very heartily at the\nfunny stories of which my employer had an im-\nmense r\u00b4epertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and\nmoving my chair a little sideways, that my own\nshadow might not fall upon the page, he begged\nme to read aloud to him. I read for about ten min-\nutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then\nsuddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered\nme to cease and to change my dress. \u201cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how cu-\nrious I became as to what the meaning of this ex-\ntraordinary performance could possibly be. They\nwere always very careful, I observed, to turn my\nface away from the window, so that I became con-\nsumed with the desire to see what was going on\nbehind my back. At \ufb01rst it seemed to be impossi-\nble, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror\nhad been broken, so a happy thought seized me,\nand I concealed a piece of the glass in my hand-\nkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my\nlaughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes,\nand was able with a little management to see all\nthat there was behind me. I confess that I was dis-\nappointed. There was nothing. At least that was\nmy \ufb01rst impression. At the second glance, how-\never, I perceived that there was a man standing in\nthe Southampton Road, a small bearded man in\na grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my di-\nrection. The road is an important highway, and\nthere are usually people there. This man, however,\nwas leaning against the railings which bordered\nour \ufb01eld and was looking earnestly up. I lowered\nmy handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to\n\ufb01nd her eyes \ufb01xed upon me with a most searching\ngaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that\nshe had divined that I had a mirror in my hand\nand had seen what was behind me.

On the very\n\ufb01rst day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Ru-\ncastle took me to a small outhouse which stands\nnear the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard\nthe sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a\nlarge animal moving about. \u201c \u2018Look in here!\u2019 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me\na slit between two planks. \u2018Is he not a beauty?\u2019\n\u201cI looked through and was conscious of two\nglowing eyes, and of a vague \ufb01gure huddled up in\nthe darkness. \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t be frightened,\u2019\nsaid my employer,\nlaughing at the start which I had given. \u2018It\u2019s only\nCarlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old\nToller, my groom, is the only man who can do any-\nthing with him. We feed him once a day, and not\ntoo much then, so that he is always as keen as mus-\ntard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God\nhelp the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t you ever on any pretext\nset your foot over the threshold at night, for it\u2019s as\nmuch as your life is worth.\u2019\n\u201cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights\nlater I happened to look out of my bedroom win-\ndow about two o\u2019clock in the morning. It was a\nbeautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of\nthe house was silvered over and almost as bright\nas day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty\nof the scene, when I was aware that something was\nmoving under the shadow of the copper beeches. 271\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches\nAs it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it\nwas. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny\ntinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge\nprojecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn\nand vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\nwhich I do not think that any burglar could have\ndone. \u201cAnd now I have a very strange experience to\ntell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in\nLondon, and I had placed it in a great coil at the\nbottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child\nwas in bed, I began to amuse myself by examin-\ning the furniture of my room and by rearranging\nmy own little things. There was an old chest of\ndrawers in the room, the two upper ones empty\nand open, the lower one locked. I had \ufb01lled the\n\ufb01rst two with my linen, and as I had still much to\npack away I was naturally annoyed at not having\nthe use of the third drawer."

It was my coil of hair. \u201cI took it up and examined it. It was of the\nsame peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But\nthen the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself\nupon me. How could my hair have been locked\nin the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my\ntrunk, turned out the contents, and drew from\nthe bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses\ntogether, and I assure you that they were identi-\ncal. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would,\nI could make nothing at all of what it meant. I re-\nturned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said\nnothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that\nI had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer\nwhich they had locked. \u201cI am naturally observant, as you may have\nremarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty\ngood plan of the whole house in my head. There\nwas one wing, however, which appeared not to be\ninhabited at all. A door which faced that which\nled into the quarters of the Tollers opened into\nthis suite, but it was invariably locked. One day,\nhowever, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucas-\ntle coming out through this door, his keys in his\nhand, and a look on his face which made him a\nvery different person to the round, jovial man to\nwhom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his\nbrow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\nstood out at his temples with passion. He locked\nthe door and hurried past me without a word or a\nlook. \u201cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went\nout for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I\nstrolled round to the side from which I could see\nthe windows of this part of the house. There were\nfour of them in a row, three of which were sim-\nply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They\nwere evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and\ndown, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucas-\ntle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as\never. \u201c \u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018you must not think me rude if\nI passed you without a word, my dear young lady.

Who would\nhave ever believed it?\u2019 He spoke in a jesting tone,\nbut there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\nme. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no\njest. \u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I un-\nderstood that there was something about that suite\nof rooms which I was not to know, I was all on\n\ufb01re to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,\nthough I have my share of that. It was more a\nfeeling of duty\u2014a feeling that some good might\ncome from my penetrating to this place. They talk\nof woman\u2019s instinct; perhaps it was woman\u2019s in-\nstinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it\nwas there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\nchance to pass the forbidden door. \u201cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I\nmay tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller\nand his wife \ufb01nd something to do in these deserted\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black\nlinen bag with him through the door. Recently he\nhas been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he\nwas very drunk; and when I came upstairs there\nwas the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that\nhe had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were\nboth downstairs, and the child was with them,\nso that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned\nthe key gently in the lock, opened the door, and\nslipped through. 272\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches\n\u201cThere was a little passage in front of me, un-\npapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right\nangle at the farther end. Round this corner were\nthree doors in a line, the \ufb01rst and third of which\nwere open. They each led into an empty room,\ndusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one\nand one in the other, so thick with dirt that the\nevening light glimmered dimly through them. The\ncentre door was closed, and across the outside of it\nhad been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron\nbed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and\nfastened at the other with stout cord. The door it-\nself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with\nthe shuttered window outside, and yet I could see\nby the glimmer from beneath it that the room was\nnot in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight\nwhich let in light from above. As I stood in the\npassage gazing at the sinister door and wonder-\ning what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the\nsound of steps within the room and saw a shadow\npass backward and forward against the little slit of\ndim light which shone out from under the door."

My overstrung nerves failed\nme suddenly, and I turned and ran\u2014ran as though\nsome dreadful hand were behind me clutching at\nthe skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage,\nthrough the door, and straight into the arms of Mr.\nRucastle, who was waiting outside. \u201c \u2018So,\u2019 said he, smiling, \u2018it was you, then. I\nthought that it must be when I saw the door open.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Oh, I am so frightened!\u2019 I panted. \u201c \u2018My dear young lady! my dear young\nlady!\u2019\u2014you cannot think how caressing and sooth-\ning his manner was\u2014\u2018and what has frightened\nyou, my dear young lady?\u2019\n\u201cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He\noverdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him. \u201c \u2018I was foolish enough to go into the empty\nwing,\u2019 I answered. \u2018But it is so lonely and eerie\nin this dim light that I was frightened and ran out\nagain. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Only that?\u2019 said he, looking at me keenly. \u201c \u2018Why, what did you think?\u2019 I asked. \u201c \u2018Why do you think that I lock this door?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I am sure that I do not know.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018It is to keep people out who have no busi-\nness there.

I suppose that I must have rushed past him\ninto my room. I remember nothing until I found\nmyself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I\nthought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there\nlonger without some advice. I was frightened of\nthe house, of the man, of the woman, of the ser-\nvants, even of the child. They were all horrible to\nme. If I could only bring you down all would be\nwell. Of course I might have \ufb02ed from the house,\nbut my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you\na wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\nto the of\ufb01ce, which is about half a mile from the\nhouse, and then returned, feeling very much eas-\nier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I ap-\nproached the door lest the dog might be loose, but\nI remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a\nstate of insensibility that evening, and I knew that\nhe was the only one in the household who had any\nin\ufb02uence with the savage creature, or who would\nventure to set him free."

Now I\nhave told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and\nI should be very glad if you could tell me what it\nall means, and, above all, what I should do.\u201d\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this\nextraordinary story.

I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that\nshe could do nothing with him.\u201d\n\u201cThat is well.

Do you think that you could perform one\n273\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches\nmore feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not\nthink you a quite exceptional woman.\u201d\n\u201cI will try. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven\no\u2019clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be\ngone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who\nmight give the alarm.

We shall then look thoroughly into\nthe affair. Of course there is only one feasible ex-\nplanation. You have been brought there to person-\nate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in\nthis chamber. That is obvious. As to who this pris-\noner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter,\nMiss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was\nsaid to have gone to America. You were chosen,\ndoubtless, as resembling her in height, \ufb01gure, and\nthe colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,\nvery possibly in some illness through which she\nhas passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sac-\nri\ufb01ced also. By a curious chance you came upon\nher tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly\nsome friend of hers\u2014possibly her \ufb01anc\u00b4e\u2014and no\ndoubt, as you wore the girl\u2019s dress and were so like\nher, he was convinced from your laughter, when-\never he saw you, and afterwards from your ges-\nture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and\nthat she no longer desired his attentions.

Don\u2019t you\nsee that the converse is equally valid. I have fre-\nquently gained my \ufb01rst real insight into the char-\nacter of parents by studying their children. This\nchild\u2019s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for\ncruelty\u2019s sake, and whether he derives this from\nhis smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his\nmother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\ntheir power.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\u201d\ncried our client. \u201cA thousand things come back\nto me which make me certain that you have hit it.

At that hour we shall be with you,\nand it will not be long before we solve the mys-\ntery.\u201d\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just\nseven when we reached the Copper Beeches, hav-\ning put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shin-\ning like burnished metal in the light of the set-\nting sun, were suf\ufb01cient to mark the house even\nhad Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the\ndoor-step. \u201cHave you managed it?\u201d asked Holmes. A loud thudding noise came from somewhere\ndownstairs. \u201cThat is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,\u201d said\nshe. \u201cHer husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\nRucastle\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cYou have done well indeed!\u201d cried Holmes\nwith enthusiasm. \u201cNow lead the way, and we shall\nsoon see the end of this black business.\u201d\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, fol-\nlowed on down a passage, and found ourselves\nin front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\ndescribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed\nthe transverse bar. Then he tried the various\nkeys in the lock, but without success. No sound\ncame from within, and at the silence Holmes\u2019 face\nclouded over. \u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he. \u201cI\nthink, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in with-\nout you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and\nwe shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once be-\nfore our united strength. Together we rushed into\nthe room. It was empty. There was no furniture\nsave a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basket-\nful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the\nprisoner gone. \u201cThere has been some villainy here,\u201d said\nHolmes; \u201cthis beauty has guessed Miss Hunter\u2019s\nintentions and has carried his victim off.\u201d\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n\u201cThrough the skylight."

Running up, I\nblew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen\nwhite teeth still meeting in the great creases of his\nneck. With much labour we separated them and\ncarried him, living but horribly mangled, into the\nhouse. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa,\nand having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear\nthe news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve\nhis pain. We were all assembled round him when\nthe door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered\nthe room. \u201cMrs. Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter. \u201cYes, miss.

Yet, silent as he was, I\nknew perfectly well what it was over which he was\nbrooding. There was but one problem before the\npublic which could challenge his powers of analy-\nsis, and that was the singular disappearance of the\nfavorite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic murder\nof its trainer.

All three bore excellent\ncharacters. John Straker, who is a married man,\nlived in a small villa about two hundred yards\nfrom the stables. He has no children, keeps one\nmaid-servant, and is comfortably off. The coun-\ntry round is very lonely, but about half a mile to\nthe north there is a small cluster of villas which\nhave been built by a Tavistock contractor for the\nuse of invalids and others who may wish to en-\njoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two\nmiles to the west, while across the moor, also about\ntwo miles distant, is the larger training establish-\nment of Mapleton, which belongs to Lord Backwa-\nter, and is managed by Silas Brown. In every other\ndirection the moor is a complete wilderness, in-\nhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was\nthe general situation last Monday night when the\ncatastrophe occurred. \u201cOn that evening the horses had been exercised\nand watered as usual, and the stables were locked\nup at nine o\u2019clock. Two of the lads walked up to\nthe trainer\u2019s house, where they had supper in the\nkitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained\non guard. At a few minutes after nine the maid,\nEdith Baxter, carried down to the stables his sup-\nper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the\nstables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty\nshould drink nothing else. The maid carried a\nlantern with her, as it was very dark and the path\nran across the open moor."

As he stepped into\nthe circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she\nsaw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing,\ndressed in a gray suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a\nknob to it. She was most impressed, however, by\nthe extreme pallor of his face and by the nervous-\nness of his manner. His age, she thought, would\nbe rather over thirty than under it. \u201c \u2018Can you tell me where I am?\u2019 he asked. \u2018I\nhad almost made up my mind to sleep on the\nmoor, when I saw the light of your lantern.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You are close to the King\u2019s Pyland training-\nstables,\u2019 said she. \u201c \u2018Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!\u2019 he cried. \u2018I understand that a stable-boy sleeps there alone\nevery night. Perhaps that is his supper which you\nare carrying to him. Now I am sure that you would\nnot be too proud to earn the price of a new dress,\nwould you?\u2019 He took a piece of white paper folded\nup out of his waistcoat pocket. \u2018See that the boy\nhas this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest\nfrock that money can buy.\u2019\n\u201cShe was frightened by the earnestness of his\nmanner, and ran past him to the window through\nwhich she was accustomed to hand the meals. It\nwas already opened, and Hunter was seated at the\nsmall table inside. She had begun to tell him of\nwhat had happened, when the stranger came up\nagain. \u201c \u2018Good-evening,\u2019 said he, looking through the\nwindow. \u2018I wanted to have a word with you.\u2019 The\ngirl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the cor-\nner of the little paper packet protruding from his\nclosed hand. \u201c \u2018What business have you here?\u2019 asked the lad. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s business that may put something into\nyour pocket,\u2019 said the other. \u2018You\u2019ve two horses\nin for the Wessex Cup\u2014Silver Blaze and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won\u2019t be a\nloser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could\ngive the other a hundred yards in \ufb01ve furlongs,\nand that the stable have put their money on him?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018So, you\u2019re one of those damned touts!\u2019 cried\nthe lad. \u2018I\u2019ll show you how we serve them in King\u2019s\nPyland.\u2019 He sprang up and rushed across the sta-\nble to unloose the dog. The girl \ufb02ed away to the\nhouse, but as she ran she looked back and saw\n282\nSilver Blaze\nthat the stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however, when Hunter rushed out\nwith the hound he was gone, and though he ran\nall round the buildings he failed to \ufb01nd any trace\nof him.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d I asked. \u201cDid the stable-boy,\nwhen he ran out with the dog, leave the door un-\nlocked behind him?\u201d\n\u201cExcellent, Watson, excellent!\u201d murmured my\ncompanion."

        "text": "\u201cThe importance of the point struck\nme so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dart-\nmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The boy\nlocked the door before he left it. The window, I\nmay add, was not large enough for a man to get\nthrough. \u201cHunter waited until his fellow-grooms had re-\nturned, when he sent a message to the trainer and\ntold him what had occurred. Straker was excited\nat hearing the account, although he does not seem\nto have quite realized its true signi\ufb01cance. It left\nhim, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker,\nwaking at one in the morning, found that he was\ndressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said that\nhe could not sleep on account of his anxiety about\nthe horses, and that he intended to walk down to\nthe stables to see that all was well. She begged\nhim to remain at home, as she could hear the rain\npattering against the window, but in spite of her\nentreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and\nleft the house. \u201cMrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning,\nto \ufb01nd that her husband had not yet returned. She\ndressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set off\nfor the stables. The door was open; inside, hud-\ndled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in\na state of absolute stupor, the favorite\u2019s stall was\nempty, and there were no signs of his trainer. \u201cThe two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting\nloft above the harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during the night, for they\nare both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously\nunder the in\ufb02uence of some powerful drug, and\nas no sense could be got out of him, he was left to\nsleep it off while the two lads and the two women\nran out in search of the absentees. They still had\nhopes that the trainer had for some reason taken\nout the horse for early exercise, but on ascending\nthe knoll near the house, from which all the neigh-\nboring moors were visible, they not only could see\nno signs of the missing favorite, but they perceived\nsomething which warned them that they were in\nthe presence of a tragedy. \u201cAbout a quarter of a mile from the stables\nJohn Straker\u2019s overcoat was \ufb02apping from a furze-\nbush. Immediately beyond there was a bowl-\nshaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom\nof this was found the dead body of the unfortunate\ntrainer. His head had been shattered by a sav-\nage blow from some heavy weapon, and he was\nwounded on the thigh, where there was a long,\nclean cut, in\ufb02icted evidently by some very sharp\ninstrument. It was clear, however, that Straker had\ndefended himself vigorously against his assailants,\nfor in his right hand he held a small knife, which\nwas clotted with blood up to the handle, while\nin his left he clasped a red and black silk cravat,\nwhich was recognized by the maid as having been\nworn on the preceding evening by the stranger\nwho had visited the stables."

        "text": "Hunter, on recover-\ning from his stupor, was also quite positive as to\nthe ownership of the cravat. He was equally cer-\ntain that the same stranger had, while standing at\nthe window, drugged his curried mutton, and so\ndeprived the stables of their watchman. As to the\nmissing horse, there were abundant proofs in the\nmud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow\nthat he had been there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has disappeared, and al-\nthough a large reward has been offered, and all the\ngypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has\ncome of him. Finally, an analysis has shown that\nthe remains of his supper left by the stable-lad con-\ntain an appreciable quantity of powdered opium,\nwhile the people at the house partook of the same\ndish on the same night without any ill effect. \u201cThose are the main facts of the case, stripped\nof all surmise, and stated as baldly as possible. I\nshall now recapitulate what the police have done\nin the matter. \u201cInspector Gregory, to whom the case has\nbeen committed, is an extremely competent of\ufb01cer. Were he but gifted with imagination he might rise\nto great heights in his profession. On his arrival\nhe promptly found and arrested the man upon\nwhom suspicion naturally rested. There was lit-\ntle dif\ufb01culty in \ufb01nding him, for he inhabited one\nof those villas which I have mentioned. His name,\nit appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man\nof excellent birth and education, who had squan-\ndered a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now\nby doing a little quiet and genteel book-making in\nthe sporting clubs of London. An examination of\nhis betting-book shows that bets to the amount of\n\ufb01ve thousand pounds had been registered by him\nagainst the favorite. On being arrested he volun-\nteered that statement that he had come down to\nDartmoor in the hope of getting some information\n283\nSilver Blaze\nabout the King\u2019s Pyland horses, and also about\nDesborough, the second favorite, which was in\ncharge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton stables. He\ndid not attempt to deny that he had acted as de-\nscribed upon the evening before, but declared that\nhe had no sinister designs, and had simply wished\nto obtain \ufb01rst-hand information. When confronted\nwith his cravat, he turned very pale, and was ut-\nterly unable to account for its presence in the hand\nof the murdered man. His wet clothing showed\nthat he had been out in the storm of the night be-\nfore, and his stick, which was a Penang-lawyer\nweighted with lead, was just such a weapon as\nmight, by repeated blows, have in\ufb02icted the ter-\nrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed. On the other hand, there was no wound upon his\nperson, while the state of Straker\u2019s knife would\nshow that one at least of his assailants must bear\nhis mark upon him. There you have it all in a nut-\nshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I\nshall be in\ufb01nitely obliged to you.\u201d\nI had listened with the greatest interest to the\nstatement which Holmes, with characteristic clear-\nness, had laid before me."

His bridle is missing, so that Simpson must have\nput this on. Then, having left the door open be-\nhind him, he was leading the horse away over the\nmoor, when he was either met or overtaken by the\ntrainer. A row naturally ensued. Simpson beat out\nthe trainer\u2019s brains with his heavy stick without\nreceiving any injury from the small knife which\nStraker used in self-defence, and then the thief ei-\nther led the horse on to some secret hiding-place,\nor else it may have bolted during the struggle, and\nbe now wandering out on the moors. That is the\ncase as it appears to the police, and improbable as\nit is, all other explanations are more improbable\nstill. However, I shall very quickly test the mat-\nter when I am once upon the spot, and until then\nI cannot really see how we can get much further\nthan our present position.\u201d\nIt was evening before we reached the little\ntown of Tavistock, which lies, like the boss of a\nshield, in the middle of the huge circle of Dart-\nmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the sta-\ntion\u2014the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair\nand beard and curiously penetrating light blue\neyes; the other a small, alert person, very neat\nand dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim\nlittle side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter\nwas Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the\nother, Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly\nmaking his name in the English detective service. \u201cI am delighted that you have come down, Mr.\nHolmes,\u201d said the Colonel. \u201cThe Inspector here\nhas done all that could possibly be suggested, but\nI wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to\navenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.\u201d\n\u201cHave there been any fresh developments?\u201d\nasked Holmes. \u201cI am sorry to say that we have made very lit-\ntle progress,\u201d said the Inspector. \u201cWe have an open\ncarriage outside, and as you would no doubt like\nto see the place before the light fails, we might talk\nit over as we drive.\u201d\nA minute later we were all seated in a comfort-\nable landau, and were rattling through the quaint\nold Devonshire city."

Gregory was formulating his theory,\nwhich was almost exactly what Holmes had fore-\ntold in the train. \u201cThe net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy\nSimpson,\u201d he remarked, \u201cand I believe myself that\nhe is our man. At the same time I recognize\nthat the evidence is purely circumstantial, and that\nsome new development may upset it.\u201d\n\u201cHow about Straker\u2019s knife?\u201d\n\u201cWe have quite come to the conclusion that he\nwounded himself in his fall.\u201d\n\u201cMy friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to\nme as we came down. If so, it would tell against\nthis man Simpson.\u201d\n284\nSilver Blaze\n\u201cUndoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any\nsign of a wound. The evidence against him is cer-\ntainly very strong. He had a great interest in the\ndisappearance of the favorite. He lies under sus-\npicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was\nundoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with\na heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead\nman\u2019s hand. I really think we have enough to go\nbefore a jury.\u201d\nHolmes shook his head. \u201cA clever counsel\nwould tear it all to rags,\u201d said he. \u201cWhy should\nhe take the horse out of the stable? If he wished\nto injure it why could he not do it there? Has a\nduplicate key been found in his possession? What\nchemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all,\nwhere could he, a stranger to the district, hide a\nhorse, and such a horse as this? What is his own\nexplanation as to the paper which he wished the\nmaid to give to the stable-boy?\u201d\n\u201cHe says that it was a ten-pound note. One\nwas found in his purse. But your other dif\ufb01cul-\nties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not\na stranger to the district. He has twice lodged at\nTavistock in the summer. The opium was probably\nbrought from London. The key, having served its\npurpose, would be hurled away. The horse may be\nat the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon\nthe moor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does he say about the cravat?\u201d\n\u201cHe acknowledges that it is his, and declares\nthat he had lost it. But a new element has been in-\ntroduced into the case which may account for his\nleading the horse from the stable.\u201d\nHolmes pricked up his ears. \u201cWe have found traces which show that a party\nof gypsies encamped on Monday night within a\nmile of the spot where the murder took place. On\nTuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that\nthere was some understanding between Simpson\nand these gypsies, might he not have been lead-\ning the horse to them when he was overtaken, and\nmay they not have him now?\u201d\n\u201cIt is certainly possible.\u201d\n\u201cThe moor is being scoured for these gypsies."

As Desborough, their horse,\nwas second in the betting, they had an interest in\nthe disappearance of the favorite.

The\nsun was beginning to sink behind the stables of\nMapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front\nof us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich,\nruddy browns where the faded ferns and bram-\nbles caught the evening light. But the glories of\nthe landscape were all wasted upon my compan-\nion, who was sunk in the deepest thought. \u201cIt\u2019s this way, Watson,\u201d said he at last. \u201cWe\nmay leave the question of who killed John Straker\nfor the instant, and con\ufb01ne ourselves to \ufb01nding\nout what has become of the horse. Now, suppos-\ning that he broke away during or after the tragedy,\nwhere could he have gone to? The horse is a very\ngregarious creature. If left to himself his instincts\nwould have been either to return to King\u2019s Pyland\nor go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild\nupon the moor?"

These people always clear out when they hear of\ntrouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the\npolice. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run a great risk and gain nothing by\ntaking him. Surely that is clear.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is he, then?\u201d\n\u201cI have already said that he must have gone\nto King\u2019s Pyland or to Mapleton. He is not at\nKing\u2019s Pyland. Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let\nus take that as a working hypothesis and see what\nit leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspec-\ntor remarked, is very hard and dry. But it falls\naway towards Mapleton, and you can see from\nhere that there is a long hollow over yonder, which\nmust have been very wet on Monday night. If\nour supposition is correct, then the horse must\nhave crossed that, and there is the point where we\nshould look for his tracks.\u201d\nWe had been walking briskly during this con-\nversation, and a few more minutes brought us\nto the hollow in question. At Holmes\u2019 request I\nwalked down the bank to the right, and he to the\nleft, but I had not taken \ufb01fty paces before I heard\nhim give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to\nme. The track of a horse was plainly outlined in\nthe soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which\nhe took from his pocket exactly \ufb01tted the impres-\nsion. \u201cSee the value of imagination,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is the one quality which Gregory lacks. We\nimagined what might have happened, acted upon\nthe supposition, and \ufb01nd ourselves justi\ufb01ed. Let\nus proceed.\u201d\nWe crossed the marshy bottom and passed over\na quarter of a mile of dry, hard turf. Again the\nground sloped, and again we came on the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick\nthem up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was\nHolmes who saw them \ufb01rst, and he stood point-\ning with a look of triumph upon his face. A man\u2019s\ntrack was visible beside the horse\u2019s. \u201cThe horse was alone before,\u201d I cried. \u201cQuite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is\nthis?\u201d\nThe double track turned sharp off and took the\ndirection of King\u2019s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and\nwe both followed along after it. His eyes were on\nthe trail, but I happened to look a little to one side,\nand saw to my surprise the same tracks coming\nback again in the opposite direction. \u201cOne for you, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, when I\npointed it out. \u201cYou have saved us a long walk,\nwhich would have brought us back on our own\ntraces. Let us follow the return track.\u201d\nWe had not to go far. It ended at the paving of\nasphalt which led up to the gates of the Mapleton\nstables. As we approached, a groom ran out from\nthem."

His face was ashy pale, beads of perspi-\nration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook\nuntil the hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the\nwind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all\ngone too, and he cringed along at my companion\u2019s\nside like a dog with its master. \u201cYour instructions will be done.

Should I change it \ufb01rst or not?\u201d\nHolmes thought a little and then burst out\nlaughing. \u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d said he; \u201cI shall write to\nyou about it.

Of course you observed the peculiarly square\ntoes in the impressions, and that his own boots ex-\nactly corresponded to them. Again, of course no\nsubordinate would have dared to do such a thing.

Were\nit mixed with any ordinary dish the eater would\nundoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no\nmore. A curry was exactly the medium which\nwould disguise this taste. By no possible suppo-\nsition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have\ncaused curry to be served in the trainer\u2019s family\nthat night, and it is surely too monstrous a coinci-\ndence to suppose that he happened to come along\nwith powdered opium upon the very night when a\ndish happened to be served which would disguise\nthe \ufb02avor. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson\nbecomes eliminated from the case, and our atten-\ntion centers upon Straker and his wife, the only\ntwo people who could have chosen curried mut-\nton for supper that night. The opium was added\nafter the dish was set aside for the stable-boy, for\nthe others had the same for supper with no ill ef-\nfects. Which of them, then, had access to that dish\nwithout the maid seeing them? \u201cBefore deciding that question I had grasped\nthe signi\ufb01cance of the silence of the dog, for one\ntrue inference invariably suggests others. The\nSimpson incident had shown me that a dog was\nkept in the stables, and yet, though some one\nhad been in and had fetched out a horse, he had\nnot barked enough to arouse the two lads in the\nloft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one\nwhom the dog knew well. \u201cI was already convinced, or almost convinced,\nthat John Straker went down to the stables in the\ndead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. For\nwhat purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously, or\nwhy should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet\nI was at a loss to know why. There have been\ncases before now where trainers have made sure\nof great sums of money by laying against their\nown horses, through agents, and then preventing\nthem from winning by fraud. Sometimes it is a\npulling jockey. Sometimes it is some surer and\nsubtler means. What was it here? I hoped that\nthe contents of his pockets might help me to form\na conclusion. \u201cAnd they did so. You cannot have forgotten\nthe singular knife which was found in the dead\nman\u2019s hand, a knife which certainly no sane man\nwould choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Wat-\nson told us, a form of knife which is used for the\nmost delicate operations known in surgery. And it\nwas to be used for a delicate operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of turf\nmatters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make\na slight nick upon the tendons of a horse\u2019s ham,\nand to do it subcutaneously, so as to leave abso-\nlutely no trace. A horse so treated would develop\na slight lameness, which would be put down to\na strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but\nnever to foul play.\u201d\n\u201cVillain!"

As a\nman of the world, Colonel, you know that men do\nnot carry other people\u2019s bills about in their pock-\nets. We have most of us quite enough to do to set-\ntle our own. I at once concluded that Straker was\nleading a double life, and keeping a second estab-\nlishment. The nature of the bill showed that there\nwas a lady in the case, and one who had expensive\ntastes. Liberal as you are with your servants, one\ncan hardly expect that they can buy twenty-guinea\nwalking dresses for their ladies. I questioned Mrs.\nStraker as to the dress without her knowing it, and\nhaving satis\ufb01ed myself that it had never reached\nher, I made a note of the milliner\u2019s address, and\nfelt that by calling there with Straker\u2019s photograph\nI could easily dispose of the mythical Derbyshire. \u201cFrom that time on all was plain. Straker had\nled out the horse to a hollow where his light would\nbe invisible. Simpson in his \ufb02ight had dropped his\ncravat, and Straker had picked it up\u2014with some\nidea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the\nhorse\u2019s leg. Once in the hollow, he had got be-\nhind the horse and had struck a light; but the crea-\nture frightened at the sudden glare, and with the\nstrange instinct of animals feeling that some mis-\nchief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel\nshoe had struck Straker full on the forehead. He\nhad already, in spite of the rain, taken off his over-\ncoat in order to do his delicate task, and so, as he\nfell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make it clear?\u201d\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d cried the Colonel. \u201cWonderful! You might have been there!\u201d\n\u201cMy \ufb01nal shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that so astute a man as Straker would\nnot undertake this delicate tendon-nicking with-\nout a little practice. What could he practice on? 291\nMy eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a ques-\ntion which, rather to my surprise, showed that my\nsurmise was correct. \u201cWhen I returned to London I called upon the\nmilliner, who had recognized Straker as an excel-\nlent customer of the name of Derbyshire, who had\na very dashing wife, with a strong partiality for ex-\npensive dresses. I have no doubt that this woman\nhad plunged him over head and ears in debt, and\nso led him into this miserable plot.\u201d\n\u201cYou have explained all but one thing,\u201d cried\nthe Colonel."

If you care to smoke a cigar in our\nrooms, Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any\nother details which might interest you.\u201d\nThe Yellow Face\nThe Yellow Face\n[In publishing these short sketches based upon\nthe numerous cases in which my companion\u2019s sin-\ngular gifts have made us the listeners to, and even-\ntually the actors in, some strange drama, it is only\nnatural that I should dwell rather upon his suc-\ncesses than upon his failures. And this not so\nmuch for the sake of his reputations\u2014for, indeed,\nit was when he was at his wits\u2019 end that his energy\nand his versatility were most admirable\u2014but be-\ncause where he failed it happened too often that no\none else succeeded, and that the tale was left for-\never without a conclusion. Now and again, how-\never, it chanced that even when he erred, the truth\nwas still discovered. I have noted of some half-\ndozen cases of the kind the Adventure of the Mus-\ngrave Ritual and that which I am about to recount\nare the two which present the strongest features of\ninterest.] S\nherlock Holmes was a man who sel-\ndom took exercise for exercise\u2019s sake. Few men were capable of greater muscu-\nlar effort, and he was undoubtedly one\nof the \ufb01nest boxers of his weight that I have ever\nseen; but he looked upon aimless bodily exertion\nas a waste of energy, and he seldom bestirred him-\nself save when there was some professional object\nto be served. Then he was absolutely untiring and\nindefatigable. That he should have kept himself in\ntraining under such circumstances is remarkable,\nbut his diet was usually of the sparest, and his\nhabits were simple to the verge of austerity. Save\nfor the occasional use of cocaine, he had no vices,\nand he only turned to the drug as a protest against\nthe monotony of existence when cases were scanty\nand the papers uninteresting. One day in early spring he had so far relaxed\nas to go for a walk with me in the Park, where\nthe \ufb01rst faint shoots of green were breaking out\nupon the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the\nchestnuts were just beginning to burst into their\n\ufb01ve-fold leaves. For two hours we rambled about\ntogether, in silence for the most part, as be\ufb01ts\ntwo men who know each other intimately. It was\nnearly \ufb01ve before we were back in Baker Street\nonce more. \u201cBeg pardon, sir,\u201d said our page-boy, as he\nopened the door. \u201cThere\u2019s been a gentleman here\nasking for you, sir.\u201d\nHolmes glanced reproachfully at me. \u201cSo much\nfor afternoon walks!\u201d said he. \u201cHas this gentleman\ngone, then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask him in?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir; he came in.\u201d\n\u201cHow long did he wait?\u201d\n\u201cHalf an hour, sir."

At last he outs into the passage,\nand he cries, \u2018Is that man never goin\u2019 to come?\u2019\nThose were his very words, sir. \u2018You\u2019ll only need\nto wait a little longer,\u2019 says I. \u2018Then I\u2019ll wait in the\nopen air, for I feel half choked,\u2019 says he. \u2018I\u2019ll be\nback before long.\u2019 And with that he ups and he\nouts, and all I could say wouldn\u2019t hold him back.\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, you did your best,\u201d said Holmes,\nas we walked into our room. \u201cIt\u2019s very annoying,\nthough, Watson. I was badly in need of a case, and\nthis looks, from the man\u2019s impatience, as if it were\nof importance. Hullo! That\u2019s not your pipe on the\ntable. He must have left his behind him. A nice\nold brier with a good long stem of what the tobac-\nconists call amber. I wonder how many real amber\nmouthpieces there are in London? Some people\nthink that a \ufb02y in it is a sign. Well, he must have\nbeen disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind\nhim which he evidently values highly.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that he values it highly?\u201d I\nasked. \u201cWell, I should put the original cost of the pipe\nat seven and sixpence. Now it has, you see, been\ntwice mended, once in the wooden stem and once\nin the amber. Each of these mends, done, as you\nobserve, with silver bands, must have cost more\nthan the pipe did originally. The man must value\nthe pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up\nrather than buy a new one with the same money.\u201d\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d I asked, for Holmes was turn-\ning the pipe about in his hand, and staring at it in\nhis peculiar pensive way. He held it up and tapped on it with his long,\nthin fore-\ufb01nger, as a professor might who was lec-\nturing on a bone. \u201cPipes are occasionally of extraordinary inter-\nest,\u201d said he. \u201cNothing has more individuality,\nsave perhaps watches and bootlaces. The indica-\ntions here, however, are neither very marked nor\nvery important. The owner is obviously a muscu-\nlar man, left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth,\ncareless in his habits, and with no need to practise\neconomy.\u201d\nMy friend threw out the information in a very\noffhand way, but I saw that he cocked his eye at\nme to see if I had followed his reasoning. \u201cYou think a man must be well-to-do if he\nsmokes a seven-shilling pipe,\u201d said I. 295\nThe Yellow Face\n\u201cThis is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an\nounce,\u201d Holmes answered, knocking a little out on\nhis palm. \u201cAs he might get an excellent smoke\nfor half the price, he has no need to practise econ-\nomy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the other points?\u201d\n\u201cHe has been in the habit of lighting his pipe\nat lamps and gas-jets."

She was a widow when I met her \ufb01rst, though\nquite young\u2014only twenty-\ufb01ve. Her name then\nwas Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when\nshe was young, and lived in the town of Atlanta,\nwhere she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer\nwith a good practice. They had one child, but the\nyellow fever broke out badly in the place, and both\nhusband and child died of it. I have seen his death\ncerti\ufb01cate. This sickened her of America, and she\ncame back to live with a maiden aunt at Pinner, in\nMiddlesex. I may mention that her husband had\nleft her comfortably off, and that she had a capi-\ntal of about four thousand \ufb01ve hundred pounds,\nwhich had been so well invested by him that it\nreturned an average of seven per cent."

Our little place was\nvery countri\ufb01ed, considering that it is so close to\ntown. We had an inn and two houses a little above\nus, and a single cottage at the other side of the\n\ufb01eld which faces us, and except those there were\nno houses until you got half way to the station. My business took me into town at certain seasons,\nbut in summer I had less to do, and then in our\ncountry home my wife and I were just as happy\nas could be wished. I tell you that there never was\na shadow between us until this accursed affair be-\ngan. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I ought to tell you before I\ngo further. When we married, my wife made over\nall her property to me\u2014rather against my will, for\nI saw how awkward it would be if my business af-\nfairs went wrong. However, she would have it so,\nand it was done. Well, about six weeks ago she\ncame to me. \u201c \u2018Jack,\u2019 said she, \u2018when you took my money\nyou said that if ever I wanted any I was to ask you\nfor it.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Certainly,\u2019 said I. \u2018It\u2019s all your own.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 said she, \u2018I want a hundred pounds.\u2019\n\u201cI was a bit staggered at this, for I had imag-\nined it was simply a new dress or something of the\nkind that she was after. \u201c \u2018What on earth for?\u2019 I asked. \u201c \u2018Oh,\u2019 said she, in her playful way, \u2018you said\nthat you were only my banker, and bankers never\nask questions, you know.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018If you really mean it, of course you shall have\nthe money,\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018Oh, yes, I really mean it.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And you won\u2019t tell me what you want it for?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Some day, perhaps, but not just at present,\nJack.\u2019\n\u201cSo I had to be content with that, thought it\nwas the \ufb01rst time that there had ever been any se-\ncret between us. I gave her a check, and I never\nthought any more of the matter. It may have noth-\ning to do with what came afterwards, but I thought\nit only right to mention it. \u201cWell, I told you just now that there is a cot-\ntage not far from our house. There is just a \ufb01eld\nbetween us, but to reach it you have to go along\nthe road and then turn down a lane. Just beyond it\nis a nice little grove of Scotch \ufb01rs, and I used to be\nvery fond of strolling down there, for trees are al-\nways a neighborly kind of things. The cottage had\nbeen standing empty this eight months, and it was\na pity, for it was a pretty two storied place, with\nan old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it."

It\nwas clear that the cottage had at last been let. I\nwalked past it, and wondered what sort of folk\nthey were who had come to live so near us. And as\nI looked I suddenly became aware that a face was\nwatching me out of one of the upper windows. \u201cI don\u2019t know what there was about that face,\nMr. Holmes, but it seemed to send a chill right\ndown my back. I was some little way off, so that\nI could not make out the features, but there was\nsomething unnatural and inhuman about the face. That was the impression that I had, and I moved\nquickly forwards to get a nearer view of the per-\nson who was watching me. But as I did so the face\nsuddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed\nto have been plucked away into the darkness of the\nroom. I stood for \ufb01ve minutes thinking the busi-\nness over, and trying to analyze my impressions. I could not tell if the face were that of a man or\na woman. It had been too far from me for that. But its color was what had impressed me most. It\nwas of a livid chalky white, and with something\n297\nThe Yellow Face\nset and rigid about it which was shockingly un-\nnatural. So disturbed was I that I determined to\nsee a little more of the new inmates of the cottage. I approached and knocked at the door, which was\ninstantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman with a\nharsh, forbidding face. \u201c \u2018What may you be wantin\u2019?\u2019 she asked, in a\nNorthern accent. \u201c \u2018I am your neighbor over yonder,\u2019 said I, nod-\nding towards my house. \u2018I see that you have only\njust moved in, so I thought that if I could be of any\nhelp to you in any\u2014\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Ay, we\u2019ll just ask ye when we want ye,\u2019 said\nshe, and shut the door in my face. Annoyed at\nthe churlish rebuff, I turned my back and walked\nhome. All evening, though I tried to think of\nother things, my mind would still turn to the ap-\nparition at the window and the rudeness of the\nwoman. I determined to say nothing about the\nformer to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly\nstrung woman, and I had no wish that she would\nshare the unpleasant impression which had been\nproduced upon myself. I remarked to her, how-\never, before I fell asleep, that the cottage was now\noccupied, to which she returned no reply. \u201cI am usually an extremely sound sleeper.

Half in\nmy dreams I was dimly conscious that something\nwas going on in the room, and gradually became\naware that my wife had dressed herself and was\nslipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips\nwere parted to murmur out some sleepy words of\nsurprise or remonstrance at this untimely prepa-\nration, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell\nupon her face, illuminated by the candle-light, and\nastonishment held me dumb. She wore an expres-\nsion such as I had never seen before\u2014such as I\nshould have thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale and breathing fast, glancing\nfurtively towards the bed as she fastened her man-\ntle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then, think-\ning that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly\nfrom the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp\ncreaking which could only come from the hinges\nof the front door.

What on this\nearth could my wife be doing out on the country\nroad at three in the morning? \u201cI had sat for about twenty minutes turning the\nthing over in my mind and trying to \ufb01nd some\npossible explanation.

The fact is that I felt as though I were\nchoking, and had a perfect longing for a breath of\nfresh air. I really think that I should have fainted\nif I had not gone out. I stood at the door for a few\nminutes, and now I am quite myself again.\u2019\n\u201cAll the time that she was telling me this story\nshe never once looked in my direction, and her\nvoice was quite unlike her usual tones."

You are not\nangry with me?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018So,\u2019 said I, \u2018this is where you went during the\nnight.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 she cried. \u201c \u2018You came here. I am sure of it. Who are\nthese people, that you should visit them at such\nan hour?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I have not been here before.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018How can you tell me what you know is\nfalse?\u2019 I cried. \u2018Your very voice changes as you\nspeak. When have I ever had a secret from you? I\nshall enter that cottage, and I shall probe the mat-\nter to the bottom.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018No, no, Jack, for God\u2019s sake!\u2019\nshe gasped,\nin uncontrollable emotion."

You will never have cause to regret it. You\nknow that I would not have a secret from you if it\nwere not for your own sake. Our whole lives are\nat stake in this. If you come home with me, all will\nbe well. If you force your way into that cottage, all\nis over between us.\u2019\n\u201cThere was such earnestness, such despair, in\nher manner that her words arrested me, and I\nstood irresolute before the door. \u201c \u2018I will trust you on one condition, and on one\ncondition only,\u2019 said I at last. \u2018It is that this mys-\ntery comes to an end from now. You are at liberty\nto preserve your secret, but you must promise me\nthat there shall be no more nightly visits, no more\ndoings which are kept from my knowledge.

Come away\u2014oh, come away up to\nthe house.\u2019\n\u201cStill pulling at my sleeve, she led me away\nfrom the cottage. As we went I glanced back, and\nthere was that yellow livid face watching us out\nof the upper window. What link could there be\nbetween that creature and my wife? Or how could\nthe coarse, rough woman whom I had seen the day\nbefore be connected with her? It was a strange\npuzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could never\nknow ease again until I had solved it. \u201cFor two days after this I stayed at home, and\nmy wife appeared to abide loyally by our engage-\nment, for, as far as I know, she never stirred out of\nthe house. On the third day, however, I had ample\nevidence that her solemn promise was not enough\nto hold her back from this secret in\ufb02uence which\ndrew her away from her husband and her duty. \u201cI had gone into town on that day, but I re-\nturned by the 2.40 instead of the 3.36, which is my\nusual train. As I entered the house the maid ran\ninto the hall with a startled face. \u201c \u2018Where is your mistress?\u2019 I asked. \u201c \u2018I think that she has gone out for a walk,\u2019 she\nanswered. \u201cMy mind was instantly \ufb01lled with suspicion.

Then of course\nI saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone\nover there, and had asked the servant to call her\nif I should return. Tingling with anger, I rushed\ndown and hurried across, determined to end the\nmatter once and forever. I saw my wife and the\nmaid hurrying back along the lane, but I did not\nstop to speak with them. In the cottage lay the\n299\nThe Yellow Face\nsecret which was casting a shadow over my life. I\nvowed that, come what might, it should be a secret\nno longer. I did not even knock when I reached it,\nbut turned the handle and rushed into the passage. \u201cIt was all still and quiet upon the ground \ufb02oor. In the kitchen a kettle was singing on the \ufb01re, and\na large black cat lay coiled up in the basket; but\nthere was no sign of the woman whom I had seen\nbefore. I ran into the other room, but it was equally\ndeserted. Then I rushed up the stairs, only to \ufb01nd\ntwo other rooms empty and deserted at the top. There was no one at all in the whole house. The\nfurniture and pictures were of the most common\nand vulgar description, save in the one chamber\nat the window of which I had seen the strange\nface. That was comfortable and elegant, and all\nmy suspicions rose into a \ufb01erce bitter \ufb02ame when\nI saw that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of a\nfell-length photograph of my wife, which had been\ntaken at my request only three months ago. \u201cI stayed long enough to make certain that the\nhouse was absolutely empty. Then I left it, feeling\na weight at my heart such as I had never had be-\nfore. My wife came out into the hall as I entered\nmy house; but I was too hurt and angry to speak\nwith her, and pushing past her, I made my way\ninto my study. She followed me, however, before I\ncould close the door. \u201c \u2018I am sorry that I broke my promise, Jack,\u2019\nsaid she; \u2018but if you knew all the circumstances I\nam sure that you would forgive me.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Tell me everything, then,\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018I cannot, Jack, I cannot,\u2019 she cried. \u201c \u2018Until you tell me who it is that has been liv-\ning in that cottage, and who it is to whom you\nhave given that photograph, there can never be any\ncon\ufb01dence between us,\u2019 said I, and breaking away\nfrom her, I left the house. That was yesterday, Mr.\nHolmes, and I have not seen her since, nor do I\nknow anything more about this strange business. It is the \ufb01rst shadow that has come between us,\nand it has so shaken me that I do not know what\nI should do for the best."

If there is any\npoint which I have not made clear, pray question\nme about it. But, above all, tell me quickly what I\nam to do, for this misery is more than I can bear.\u201d\nHolmes and I had listened with the utmost in-\nterest to this extraordinary statement, which had\nbeen delivered in the jerky, broken fashion of a\nman who is under the in\ufb02uence of extreme emo-\ntions.

Let me advise\nyou, then, to return to Norbury, and to examine\nthe windows of the cottage again. If you have rea-\nson to believe that is inhabited, do not force your\nway in, but send a wire to my friend and me.

Upon my word,\nWatson, there is something very attractive about\nthat livid face at the window, and I would not have\nmissed the case for worlds.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a theory?\u201d\n\u201cYes, a provisional one. But I shall be surprised\nif it does not turn out to be correct. This woman\u2019s\n\ufb01rst husband is in that cottage.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\n\u201cHow else can we explain her frenzied anxi-\nety that her second one should not enter it? The\nfacts, as I read them, are something like this: This\nwoman was married in America. Her husband\ndeveloped some hateful qualities; or shall we say\nthat he contracted some loathsome disease, and\nbecame a leper or an imbecile? She \ufb02ies from him\nat last, returns to England, changes her name, and\nstarts her life, as she thinks, afresh. She has been\nmarried three years, and believes that her posi-\ntion is quite secure, having shown her husband the\ndeath certi\ufb01cate of some man whose name she has\nassumed, when suddenly her whereabouts is dis-\ncovered by her \ufb01rst husband; or, we may suppose,\nby some unscrupulous woman who has attached\nherself to the invalid. They write to the wife, and\nthreaten to come and expose her. She asks for a\nhundred pounds, and endeavors to buy them off. They come in spite of it, and when the husband\nmentions casually to the wife that there a new-\ncomers in the cottage, she knows in some way that\nthey are her pursuers. She waits until her husband\nis asleep, and then she rushes down to endeavor\nto persuade them to leave her in peace. Having\nno success, she goes again next morning, and her\nhusband meets her, as he has told us, as she comes\nout. She promises him then not to go there again,\nbut two days afterwards the hope of getting rid of\nthose dreadful neighbors was too strong for her,\nand she made another attempt, taking down with\nher the photograph which had probably been de-\nmanded from her. In the midst of this interview\nthe maid rushed in to say that the master had come\nhome, on which the wife, knowing that he would\ncome straight down to the cottage, hurried the in-\nmates out at the back door, into the grove of \ufb01r-\ntrees, probably, which was mentioned as standing\nnear. In this way he found the place deserted. I\nshall be very much surprised, however, if it still so\nwhen he reconnoitres it this evening. What do you\nthink of my theory?\u201d\n\u201cIt is all surmise.\u201d\n\u201cBut at least it covers all the facts. When new\nfacts come to our knowledge which cannot be cov-\nered by it, it will be time enough to reconsider it. We can do nothing more until we have a message\nfrom our friend at Norbury.\u201d\nBut we had not a very long time to wait for\nthat."

Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room\nat the top, and we entered at his heels. It was a cosy, well-furnished apartment, with\ntwo candles burning upon the table and two upon\nthe mantelpiece. In the corner, stooping over a\ndesk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl. Her face was turned away as we entered, but we\ncould see that she was dressed in a red frock, and\nthat she had long white gloves on. As she whisked\nround to us, I gave a cry of surprise and hor-\nror. The face which she turned towards us was\nof the strangest livid tint, and the features were\nabsolutely devoid of any expression. An instant\nlater the mystery was explained. Holmes, with a\nlaugh, passed his hand behind the child\u2019s ear, a\nmask peeled off from her countenance, an there\nwas a little coal black negress, with all her white\nteeth \ufb02ashing in amusement at our amazed faces. I\nburst out laughing, out of sympathy with her mer-\nriment; but Grant Munro stood staring, with his\nhand clutching his throat. \u201cMy God!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat can be the meaning\nof this?\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you the meaning of it,\u201d cried the\nlady, sweeping into the room with a proud, set\nface. \u201cYou have forced me, against my own judg-\nment, to tell you, and now we must both make the\nbest of it. My husband died at Atlanta.

There was a portrait within of a man strik-\ningly handsome and intelligent-looking, but bear-\ning unmistakable signs upon his features of his\nAfrican descent. \u201cThat is John Hebron, of Atlanta,\u201d said the\nlady, \u201cand a nobler man never walked the earth. I cut myself off from my race in order to wed him,\nbut never once while he lived did I for an instant\nregret it. It was our misfortune that our only child\ntook after his people rather than mine. It is often\nso in such matches, and little Lucy is darker far\nthan ever her father was. But dark or fair, she is\nmy own dear little girlie, and her mother\u2019s pet.\u201d\nThe little creature ran across at the words and nes-\ntled up against the lady\u2019s dress. \u201cWhen I left her in\nAmerica,\u201d she continued, \u201cit was only because her\nhealth was weak, and the change might have done\nher harm. She was given to the care of a faith-\nful Scotch woman who had once been our servant. Never for an instant did I dream of disowning her\nas my child.

The public not\nunnaturally goes on the principle that he who\nwould heal others must himself be whole, and\nlooks askance at the curative powers of the man\nwhose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs.

        "text": "\u201cHow on earth\u2014\u201d I began,\nbut Holmes answered my question before it was\nasked. \u201cYour slippers are new,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could\nnot have had them more than a few weeks. The\nsoles which you are at this moment presenting to\nme are slightly scorched. For a moment I thought\nthey might have got wet and been burned in the\ndrying. But near the instep there is a small circu-\nlar wafer of paper with the shopman\u2019s hieroglyph-\nics upon it. Damp would of course have removed\nthis. You had, then, been sitting with our feet out-\nstretched to the \ufb01re, which a man would hardly do\neven in so wet a June as this if he were in his full\nhealth.\u201d\nLike all Holmes\u2019s reasoning the thing seemed\nsimplicity itself when it was once explained. He\nread the thought upon my features, and his smile\nhad a tinge of bitterness. \u201cI am afraid that I rather give myself away\nwhen I explain,\u201d said he. \u201cResults without causes\nare much more impressive. You are ready to come\nto Birmingham, then?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly. What is the case?\u201d\n\u201cYou shall hear it all in the train. My client is\noutside in a four-wheeler. Can you come at once?\u201d\n\u201cIn an instant.\u201d I scribbled a note to my neigh-\nbor, rushed upstairs to explain the matter to my\nwife, and joined Holmes upon the door-step. \u201cYour neighbor is a doctor,\u201d said he, nodding\nat the brass plate. \u201cYes; he bought a practice as I did.\u201d\n\u201cAn old-established one?\u201d\n\u201cJust the same as mine. Both have been ever\nsince the houses were built.\u201d\n307\nThe Stock-Broker\u2019s Clerk\n\u201cAh! Then you got hold of the best of the two.\u201d\n\u201cI think I did. But how do you know?\u201d\n\u201cBy the steps, my boy. Yours are worn three\ninches deeper than his. But this gentleman in the\ncab is my client, Mr. Hall Pycroft. Allow me to in-\ntroduce you to him. Whip your horse up, cabby,\nfor we have only just time to catch our train.\u201d\nThe man whom I found myself facing was a\nwell built, fresh-complexioned young fellow, with\na frank, honest face and a slight, crisp, yellow mus-\ntache. He wore a very shiny top hat and a neat\nsuit of sober black, which made him look what\nhe was\u2014a smart young City man, of the class\nwho have been labeled cockneys, but who give us\nour crack volunteer regiments, and who turn out\nmore \ufb01ne athletes and sportsmen than any body\nof men in these islands. His round, ruddy face\nwas naturally full of cheeriness, but the corners of\nhis mouth seemed to me to be pulled down in a\nhalf-comical distress. It was not, however, until we\nwere all in a \ufb01rst-class carriage and well started\nupon our journey to Birmingham that I was able\nto learn what the trouble was which had driven\nhim to Sherlock Holmes. \u201cWe have a clear run here of seventy minutes,\u201d\nHolmes remarked. \u201cI want you, Mr. Hall Pycroft,\nto tell my friend your very interesting experience\nexactly as you have told it to me, or with more de-\ntail if possible."

It is a case, Watson,\nwhich may prove to have something in it, or may\nprove to have nothing, but which, at least, presents\nthose unusual and outr\u00b4e features which are as dear\nto you as they are to me. Now, Mr. Pycroft, I shall\nnot interrupt you again.\u201d\nOur young companion looked at me with a\ntwinkle in his eye. \u201cThe worst of the story is,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I\nshow myself up as such a confounded fool. Of\ncourse it may work out all right, and I don\u2019t see\nthat I could have done otherwise; but if I have lost\nmy crib and get nothing in exchange I shall feel\nwhat a soft Johnnie I have been. I\u2019m not very good\nat telling a story, Dr. Watson, but it is like this with\nme:\n\u201cI used to have a billet at Coxon & Wood-\nhouse\u2019s, of Draper\u2019s Gardens, but they were let in\nearly in the spring through the Venezuelan loan, as\nno doubt you remember, and came a nasty crop-\nper. I had been with them \ufb01ve years, and old\nCoxon gave me a ripping good testimonial when\nthe smash came, but of course we clerks were all\nturned adrift, the twenty-seven of us. I tried here\nand tried there, but there were lots of other chaps\non the same lay as myself, and it was a perfect frost\nfor a long time. I had been taking three pounds a\nweek at Coxon\u2019s, and I had saved about seventy\nof them, but I soon worked my way through that\nand out at the other end. I was fairly at the end of\nmy tether at last, and could hardly \ufb01nd the stamps\nto answer the advertisements or the envelopes to\nstick them to. I had worn out my boots paddling\nup of\ufb01ce stairs, and I seemed just as far from get-\nting a billet as ever. \u201cAt last I saw a vacancy at Mawson &\nWilliams\u2019s, the great stock-broking \ufb01rm in Lom-\nbard Street. I dare say E. C. is not much in your\nline, but I can tell you that this is about the richest\nhouse in London. The advertisement was to be an-\nswered by letter only. I sent in my testimonial and\napplication, but without the least hope of getting\nit. Back came an answer by return, saying that if I\nwould appear next Monday I might take over my\nnew duties at once, provided that my appearance\nwas satisfactory. No one knows how these things\nare worked. Some people say that the manager\njust plunges his hand into the heap and takes the\n\ufb01rst that comes. Anyhow it was my innings that\ntime, and I don\u2019t ever wish to feel better pleased. The screw was a pound a week rise, and the duties\njust about the same as at Coxon\u2019s. \u201cAnd now I come to the queer part of the busi-\nness."

Well, I was sitting doing a smoke\nthat very evening after I had been promised the\nappointment, when up came my landlady with a\ncard which had \u201cArthur Pinner, Financial Agent,\u201d\nprinted upon it. I had never heard the name before\nand could not imagine what he wanted with me;\nbut, of course, I asked her to show him up. In he\nwalked, a middle-sized, dark-haired, dark-eyed,\nblack-bearded man, with a touch of the sheeny\nabout his nose. He had a brisk kind of way with\nhim and spoke sharply, like a man who knew the\nvalue of time. \u201c \u2018Mr. Hall Pycroft, I believe?\u2019 said he. \u201c \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 I answered, pushing a chair towards\nhim. \u201c \u2018Lately engaged at Coxon & Woodhouse\u2019s?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And now on the staff of Mawson\u2019s.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Quite so.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 said he, \u2018the fact is that I have heard\nsome really extraordinary stories about your \ufb01nan-\ncial ability. You remember Parker, who used to be\nCoxon\u2019s manager? He can never say enough about\nit.\u2019\n308\nThe Stock-Broker\u2019s Clerk\n\u201cOf course I was pleased to hear this. I had\nalways been pretty sharp in the of\ufb01ce, but I had\nnever dreamed that I was talked about in the City\nin this fashion. \u201c \u2018You have a good memory?\u2019 said he. \u201c \u2018Pretty fair,\u2019 I answered, modestly. \u201c \u2018Have you kept in touch with the market\nwhile you have been out of work?\u2019 he asked. \u201c \u2018Yes. I read the stock exchange list every\nmorning.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Now that shows real application!\u2019 he cried. \u2018That is the way to prosper! You won\u2019t mind my\ntesting you, will you? Let me see. How are Ayr-\nshires?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018A hundred and six and a quarter to a hun-\ndred and \ufb01ve and seven-eighths.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And New Zealand consolidated?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018A hundred and four.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And British Broken Hills?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Seven to seven-and-six.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Wonderful!\u2019\nhe cried, with his hands up. \u2018This quite \ufb01ts in with all that I had heard. My\nboy, my boy, you are very much too good to be a\nclerk at Mawson\u2019s!\u2019\n\u201cThis outburst rather astonished me, as you\ncan think. \u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018other people don\u2019t think\nquite so much of me as you seem to do, Mr. Pinner. I had a hard enough \ufb01ght to get this berth, and I\nam very glad to have it.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Pooh, man; you should soar above it. You\nare not in your true sphere. Now, I\u2019ll tell you how\nit stands with me. What I have to offer is little\nenough when measured by your ability, but when\ncompared with Mawson\u2019s, it\u2019s light to dark. Let\nme see. When do you go to Mawson\u2019s?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018On Monday.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Ha, ha! I think I would risk a little sporting\n\ufb02utter that you don\u2019t go there at all.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Not go to Mawson\u2019s?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018No, sir. By that day you will be the busi-\nness manager of the Franco-Midland Hardware\nCompany, Limited, with a hundred and thirty-four\nbranches in the towns and villages of France, not\ncounting one in Brussels and one in San Remo.\u2019\n\u201cThis took my breath away."

It has been kept very quiet,\nfor the capital was all privately subscribed, and it\u2019s\ntoo good a thing to let the public into. My brother,\nHarry Pinner, is promoter, and joins the board af-\nter allotment as managing director. He knew I was\nin the swim down here, and asked me to pick up\na good man cheap.

We can only\noffer you a beggarly \ufb01ve hundred to start with.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Five hundred a year!\u2019 I shouted. \u201c \u2018Only that at the beginning; but you are to\nhave an overriding commission of one per cent on\nall business done by your agents, and you may\ntake my word for it that this will come to more\nthan your salary.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018But I know nothing about hardware.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Tut, my boy; you know about \ufb01gures.\u2019\n\u201cMy head buzzed, and I could hardly sit still in\nmy chair.

You will \ufb01nd him at 126b\nCorporation Street, where the temporary of\ufb01ces of\nthe company are situated. Of course he must con-\n\ufb01rm your engagement, but between ourselves it\nwill be all right.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Really, I hardly know how to express my\ngratitude, Mr. Pinner,\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018Not at all, my boy. You have only got your\ndesserts. There are one or two small things\u2014mere\nformalities\u2014which I must arrange with you. You\nhave a bit of paper beside you there. Kindly write\nupon it \u201cI am perfectly willing to act as business\nmanager to the Franco-Midland Hardware Com-\npany, Limited, at a minimum salary of \u00a3500.\u201d \u2019\n\u201cI did as he asked, and he put the paper in his\npocket. \u201c \u2018There is one other detail,\u2019 said he. \u2018What do\nyou intend to do about Mawson\u2019s?\u2019\n\u201cI had forgotten all about Mawson\u2019s in my joy. \u2018I\u2019ll write and resign,\u2019 said I. 309\nThe Stock-Broker\u2019s Clerk\n\u201c \u2018Precisely what I don\u2019t want you to do. I had\na row over you with Mawson\u2019s manager. I had\ngone up to ask him about you, and he was very\noffensive; accused me of coaxing you away from\nthe service of the \ufb01rm, and that sort of thing."

Good-night; and may you have all the\nfortune that you deserve!\u2019\n\u201cThat\u2019s just about all that passed between us,\nas near as I can remember. You can imagine, Dr.\nWatson, how pleased I was at such an extraordi-\nnary bit of good fortune. I sat up half the night\nhugging myself over it, and next day I was off\nto Birmingham in a train that would take me in\nplenty time for my appointment. I took my things\nto a hotel in New Street, and then I made my way\nto the address which had been given me. \u201cIt was a quarter of an hour before my time, but\nI thought that would make no difference. 126b was\na passage between two large shops, which led to a\nwinding stone stair, from which there were many\n\ufb02ats, let as of\ufb01ces to companies or professional\nmen. The names of the occupants were painted\nat the bottom on the wall, but there was no such\nname as the Franco-Midland Hardware Company,\nLimited. I stood for a few minutes with my heart\nin my boots, wondering whether the whole thing\nwas an elaborate hoax or not, when up came a man\nand addressed me. He was very like the chap I had\nseen the night before, the same \ufb01gure and voice,\nbut he was clean shaven and his hair was lighter. \u201c \u2018Are you Mr. Hall Pycroft?\u2019 he asked. \u201c \u2018Yes,\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018Oh! I was expecting you, but you are a tri\ufb02e\nbefore your time. I had a note from my brother\nthis morning in which he sang your praises very\nloudly.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I was just looking for the of\ufb01ces when you\ncame.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018We have not got our name up yet, for we\nonly secured these temporary premises last week. Come up with me, and we will talk the matter\nover.\u2019\n\u201cI followed him to the top of a very lofty stair,\nand there, right under the slates, were a couple of\nempty, dusty little rooms, uncarpeted and uncur-\ntained, into which he led me."

However,\ncome what might, I had my money, so I settled\ndown to my task. All Sunday I was kept hard at\nwork, and yet by Monday I had only got as far as\nH. I went round to my employer, found him in the\nsame dismantled kind of room, and was told to\nkeep at it until Wednesday, and then come again.

Of course you expect two brothers to\nbe alike, but not that they should have the same\ntooth stuffed in the same way. He bowed me out,\nand I found myself in the street, hardly knowing\nwhether I was on my head or my heels. Back I\nwent to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold\nwater, and tried to think it out. Why had he sent\nme from London to Birmingham? Why had he got\nthere before me? And why had he written a let-\nter from himself to himself? It was altogether too\nmuch for me, and I could make no sense of it. And\nthen suddenly it struck me that what was dark to\nme might be very light to Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I\nhad just time to get up to town by the night train to\nsee him this morning, and to bring you both back\nwith me to Birmingham.\u201d\nThere was a pause after the stock-broker\u2019s clerk\nhad concluded his surprising experience.

As we watched him he looked across at a\nboy who was bawling out the latest edition of the\nevening paper, and running over among the cabs\nand busses, he bought one from him. Then, clutch-\ning it in his hand, he vanished through a door-way. \u201cThere he goes!\u201d cried Hall Pycroft. \u201cThese\nare the company\u2019s of\ufb01ces into which he has gone. Come with me, and I\u2019ll \ufb01x it up as easily as possi-\nble.\u201d\n311\nThe Stock-Broker\u2019s Clerk\nFollowing his lead, we ascended \ufb01ve stories,\nuntil we found ourselves outside a half-opened\ndoor, at which our client tapped. A voice within\nbade us enter, and we entered a bare, unfurnished\nroom such as Hall Pycroft had described. At the\nsingle table sat the man whom we had seen in\nthe street, with his evening paper spread out in\nfront of him, and as he looked up at us it seemed\nto me that I had never looked upon a face which\nbore such marks of grief, and of something beyond\ngrief\u2014of a horror such as comes to few men in a\nlifetime. His brow glistened with perspiration, his\ncheeks were of the dull, dead white of a \ufb01sh\u2019s belly,\nand his eyes were wild and staring. He looked\nat his clerk as though he failed to recognize him,\nand I could see by the astonishment depicted upon\nour conductor\u2019s face that this was by no means the\nusual appearance of his employer. \u201cYou look ill, Mr. Pinner!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYes, I am not very well,\u201d answered the other,\nmaking obvious efforts to pull himself together,\nand licking his dry lips before he spoke. \u201cWho\nare these gentlemen whom you have brought with\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cOne is Mr. Harris, of Bermondsey, and the\nother is Mr. Price, of this town,\u201d said our clerk,\nglibly."

He was pale when we entered the room,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is just possible that\u2014\u201d\nHis words were interrupted by a sharp rat-tat\nfrom the direction of the inner door. \u201cWhat the deuce is he knocking at his own\ndoor for?\u201d cried the clerk. Again and much louder cam the rat-tat-tat. We\nall gazed expectantly at the closed door. Glanc-\ning at Holmes, I saw his face turn rigid, and he\nleaned forward in intense excitement. Then sud-\ndenly came a low guggling, gargling sound, and a\nbrisk drumming upon woodwork. Holmes sprang\nfrantically across the room and pushed at the door. It was fastened on the inner side. Following his\nexample, we threw ourselves upon it with all our\nweight. One hinge snapped, then the other, and\ndown came the door with a crash."

At one corner, the corner nearest the\nroom which we had left, there was a second door. Holmes sprang to it and pulled it open. A coat\nand waistcoat were lying on the \ufb02oor, and from\na hook behind the door, with his own braces\nround his neck, was hanging the managing di-\nrector of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company. 312\nThe Stock-Broker\u2019s Clerk\nHis knees were drawn up, his head hung at a\ndreadful angle to his body, and the clatter of his\nheels against the door made the noise which had\nbroken in upon our conversation. In an instant I\nhad caught him round the waist, and held him up\nwhile Holmes and Pycroft untied the elastic bands\nwhich had disappeared between the livid creases\nof skin. Then we carried him into the other room,\nwhere he lay with a clay-colored face, puf\ufb01ng his\npurple lips in and out with every breath\u2014a dread-\nful wreck of all that he had been but \ufb01ve minutes\nbefore. \u201cWhat do you think of him, Watson?\u201d asked\nHolmes. I stooped over him and examined him. His\npulse was feeble and intermittent, but his breath-\ning grew longer, and there was a little shivering of\nhis eyelids, which showed a thin white slit of ball\nbeneath. \u201cIt has been touch and go with him,\u201d said I,\n\u201cbut he\u2019ll live now.

Holmes stood by the table, with his hands deep\nin his trouser\u2019s pockets and his chin upon his\nbreast. \u201cI suppose we ought to call the police in now,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cAnd yet I confess that I\u2019d like to give\nthem a complete case when they come.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessed mystery to me,\u201d cried Pycroft,\nscratching his head. \u201cWhatever they wanted to\nbring me all the way up here for, and then\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPooh! All that is clear enough,\u201d said Holmes\nimpatiently. \u201cIt is this last sudden move.\u201d\n\u201cYou understand the rest, then?\u201d\n\u201cI think that it is fairly obvious. What do you\nsay, Watson?\u201d\nI shrugged my shoulders. \u201cI must confess that\nI am out of my depths,\u201d said I. \u201cOh surely if you consider the events at \ufb01rst\nthey can only point to one conclusion.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you make of them?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the whole thing hinges upon two points. The \ufb01rst is the making of Pycroft write a declara-\ntion by which he entered the service of this pre-\nposterous company. Do you not see how very sug-\ngestive that is?\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid I miss the point.\u201d\n\u201cWell, why did they want him to do it?

Why? When we answer that we\nhave made some progress with our little problem. Why? There can be only one adequate reason. Someone wanted to learn to imitate your writing,\nand had to procure a specimen of it \ufb01rst. And now\nif we pass on to the second point we \ufb01nd that each\nthrows light upon the other. That point is the re-\nquest made by Pinner that you should not resign\nyour place, but should leave the manager of this\nimportant business in the full expectation that a\nMr. Hall Pycroft, whom he had never seen, was\nabout to enter the of\ufb01ce upon the Monday morn-\ning.\u201d\n\u201cMy God!\u201d cried our client, \u201cwhat a blind bee-\ntle I have been!\u201d\n\u201cNow you see the point about the handwrit-\ning. Suppose that some one turned up in your\nplace who wrote a completely different hand from\nthat in which you had applied for the vacancy, of\ncourse the game would have been up.

That is all plain enough.\u201d\n\u201cBut why should this man pretend to be his\nown brother?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that is pretty clear also. There are ev-\nidently only two of them in it. The other is im-\npersonating you at the of\ufb01ce. This one acted as\nyour engager, and then found that he could not\n\ufb01nd you an employer without admitting a third\nperson into his plot.

He changed his appearance as far as\nhe could, and trusted that the likeness, which you\ncould not fail to observe, would be put down to a\n313\nThe Stock-Broker\u2019s Clerk\nfamily resemblance. But for the happy chance of\nthe gold stuf\ufb01ng, your suspicions would probably\nnever have been aroused.\u201d\nHall Pycroft shook his clinched hands in the\nair. \u201cGood Lord!\u201d he cried, \u201cwhile I have been\nfooled in this way, what has this other Hall Pycroft\nbeen doing at Mawson\u2019s?

Here is what we want. Look at the head-\nlines: \u2018Crime in the City. Murder at Mawson &\nWilliams\u2019s. Gigantic attempted Robbery. Capture\nof the Criminal.\u2019 Here, Watson, we are all equally\nanxious to hear it, so kindly read it aloud to us.\u201d\nIt appeared from its position in the paper to\nhave been the one event of importance in town,\nand the account of it ran in this way:\n\u201cA desperate attempt at robbery, culminat-\ning in the death of one man and the cap-\nture of the criminal, occurred this afternoon\nin the City. For some time back Mawson\n& Williams, the famous \ufb01nancial house,\nhave been the guardians of securities which\namount in the aggregate to a sum of con-\nsiderably over a million sterling. So con-\nscious was the manager of the responsibility\nwhich devolved upon him in consequence\nof the great interests at stake that safes of\nthe very latest construction have been em-\nployed, and an armed watchman has been\nleft day and night in the building. It ap-\npears that last week a new clerk named Hall\nPycroft was engaged by the \ufb01rm. This per-\nson appears to have been none other that\nBeddington, the famous forger and cracks-\nman, who, with his brother, had only re-\ncently emerged from a \ufb01ve years\u2019 spell of\npenal servitude. By some mean, which are\nnot yet clear, he succeeded in winning, un-\nder a false name, this of\ufb01cial position in\nthe of\ufb01ce, which he utilized in order to ob-\ntain moulding of various locks, and a thor-\nough knowledge of the position of the strong\nroom and the safes. \u201cIt is customary at Mawson\u2019s for the clerks\nto leave at midday on Saturday. Sergeant\nTuson, of the City Police, was somewhat\nsurprised, therefore to see a gentleman with\na carpet bag come down the steps at twenty\nminutes past one. His suspicions being\naroused, the sergeant followed the man, and\nwith the aid of Constable Pollack succeeded,\nafter a most desperate resistance, in arrest-\ning him."

The man\u2019s skull\nhad been shattered by a blow from a poker\ndelivered from behind.

I was never a very socia-\nble fellow, Watson, always rather fond of moping\nin my rooms and working out my own little meth-\nods of thought, so that I never mixed much with\nthe men of my year. Bar fencing and boxing I had\nfew athletic tastes, and then my line of study was\nquite distinct from that of the other fellows, so that\nwe had no points of contact at all. Trevor was the\nonly man I knew, and that only through the acci-\ndent of his bull terrier freezing on to my ankle one\nmorning as I went down to chapel. \u201cIt was a prosaic way of forming a friendship,\nbut it was effective. I was laid by the heels for\nten days, but Trevor used to come in to inquire af-\nter me. At \ufb01rst it was only a minute\u2019s chat, but\nsoon his visits lengthened, and before the end of\nthe term we were close friends. He was a hearty,\nfull-blooded fellow, full of spirits and energy, the\nvery opposite to me in most respects, but we had\nsome subjects in common, and it was a bond of\nunion when I found that he was as friendless as I. Finally, he invited me down to his father\u2019s place at\nDonnithorpe, in Norfolk, and I accepted his hospi-\ntality for a month of the long vacation. \u201cOld Trevor was evidently a man of some\nwealth and consideration, a J.P., and a landed pro-\nprietor. Donnithorpe is a little hamlet just to the\nnorth of Langmere, in the country of the Broads. The house was and old-fashioned, wide-spread,\noak-beamed brick building, with a \ufb01ne lime-lined\navenue leading up to it. There was excellent wild-\nduck shooting in the fens, remarkably good \ufb01sh-\ning, a small but select library, taken over, as I un-\nderstood, from a former occupant, and a tolerable\ncook, so that he would be a fastidious man who\ncould not put in a pleasant month there. \u201cTrevor senior was a widower, and my friend\nhis only son. \u201cThere had been a daughter, I heard, but she\nhad died of diphtheria while on a visit to Birm-\ningham. The father interested me extremely. He\nwas a man of little culture, but with a consider-\nable amount of rude strength, both physically and\nmentally. He knew hardly any books, but he had\ntraveled far, had seen much of the world. And had\nremembered all that he had learned. In person he\nwas a thick-set, burly man with a shock of grizzled\nhair, a brown, weather-beaten face, and blue eyes\nwhich were keen to the verge of \ufb01erceness. Yet\nhe had a reputation for kindness and charity on\nthe country-side, and was noted for the leniency\nof his sentences from the bench."

I\u2019ve always\nbeen on my guard since then, though I have no\nidea how you know it.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You have a very handsome stick,\u2019 I answered. \u2018By the inscription I observed that you had not had\nit more than a year.

His attack did not last long,\nhowever, for when we undid his collar, and sprin-\nkled the water from one of the \ufb01nger-glasses over\nhis face, he gave a gasp or two and sat up. \u201c \u2018Ah, boys,\u2019 said he, forcing a smile, \u2018I hope I\nhaven\u2019t frightened you.

That\u2019s your line of life, sir, and you\nmay take the word of a man who has seen some-\nthing of the world.\u2019\n\u201cAnd that recommendation, with the exagger-\nated estimate of my ability with which he pref-\naced it, was, if you will believe me, Watson, the\nvery \ufb01rst thing which ever made me feel that a\nprofession might be made out of what had up to\nthat time been the merest hobby. At the moment,\nhowever, I was too much concerned at the sudden\nillness of my host to think of anything else. \u201c \u2018I hope that I have said nothing to pain you?\u2019\nsaid I. \u201c \u2018Well, you certainly touched upon rather a\ntender point. Might I ask how you know, and how\nmuch you know?\u2019 He spoke now in a half-jesting\nfashion, but a look of terror still lurked at the back\nof his eyes. \u201c \u2018It is simplicity itself,\u2019 said I. \u2018When you bared\nyour arm to draw that \ufb01sh into the boat I saw that\nJ. A. had been tattooed in the bend of the elbow. The letters were still legible, but it was perfectly\nclear from their blurred appearance, and from the\nstaining of the skin round them, that efforts had\nbeen made to obliterate them. It was obvious, then,\nthat those initials had once been very familiar to\nyou, and that you had afterwards wished to forget\nthem.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018What an eye you have!\u2019 he cried, with a sigh\nof relief. \u2018It is just as you say. But we won\u2019t talk\nof it. Of all ghosts the ghosts of our old lovers are\nthe worst. Come into the billiard-room and have a\nquiet cigar.\u2019\n\u201cFrom that day, amid all his cordiality, there\nwas always a touch of suspicion in Mr. Trevor\u2019s\nmanner towards me. Even his son remarked it. \u2018You\u2019ve given the governor such a turn,\u2019 said he,\n\u2018that he\u2019ll never be sure again of what you know\nand what you don\u2019t know.\u2019 He did not mean to\nshow it, I am sure, but it was so strongly in his\nmind that it peeped out at every action. At last\nI became so convinced that I was causing him un-\neasiness that I drew my visit to a close. On the very\nday, however, before I left, an incident occurred\nwhich proved in the sequel to be of importance. \u201cWe were sitting out upon the lawn on garden\nchairs, the three of us, basking in the sun and ad-\nmiring the view across the Broads, when a maid\n318\nThe \u201cGloria Scott\u201d\ncame out to say that there was a man at the door\nwho wanted to see Mr. Trevor. \u201c \u2018What is his name?\u2019 asked my host. \u201c \u2018He would not give any.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018What does he want, then?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018He says that you know him, and that he only\nwants a moment\u2019s conversation.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Show him round here.\u2019\nAn instant after-\nwards there appeared a little wizened fellow with\na cringing manner and a shambling style of walk-\ning."

His\nface was thin and brown and crafty, with a perpet-\nual smile upon it, which showed an irregular line\nof yellow teeth, and his crinkled hands were half\nclosed in a way that is distinctive of sailors. As he\ncame slouching across the lawn I heard Mr. Trevor\nmake a sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and\njumping out of his chair, he ran into the house. He\nwas back in a moment, and I smelt a strong reek\nof brandy as he passed me. \u201c \u2018Well, my man,\u2019 said he. \u2018What can I do for\nyou?\u2019\n\u201cThe sailor stood looking at him with puckered\neyes, and with the same loose-lipped smile upon\nhis face. \u201c \u2018You don\u2019t know me?\u2019 he asked. \u201c \u2018Why, dear me, it is surely Hudson,\u2019 said Mr.\nTrevor in a tone of surprise. \u201c \u2018Hudson it is, sir,\u2019 said the seaman. \u2018Why, it\u2019s\nthirty year and more since I saw you last. Here\nyou are in your house, and me still picking my\nsalt meat out of the harness cask.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Tut, you will \ufb01nd that I have not forgotten\nold times,\u2019 cried Mr. Trevor, and, walking towards\nthe sailor, he said something in a low voice. \u2018Go\ninto the kitchen,\u2019 he continued out loud, \u2018and you\nwill get food and drink. I have no doubt that I\nshall \ufb01nd you a situation.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Thank you, sir,\u2019 said the seaman, touching\nhis fore-lock. \u2018I\u2019m just off a two-yearer in an eight-\nknot tramp, short-handed at that, and I wants a\nrest. I thought I\u2019d get it either with Mr. Beddoes or\nwith you.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Ah!\u2019 cried Trevor. \u2018You know where Mr. Bed-\ndoes is?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Bless you, sir, I know where all my old\nfriends are,\u2019 said the fellow with a sinister smile,\nand he slouched off after the maid to the kitchen. Mr. Trevor mumbled something to us about having\nbeen shipmate with the man when he was going\nback to the diggings, and then, leaving us on the\nlawn, he went indoors. An hour later, when we\nentered the house, we found him stretched dead\ndrunk upon the dining-room sofa. The whole in-\ncident left a most ugly impression upon my mind,\nand I was not sorry next day to leave Donnithorpe\nbehind me, for I felt that my presence must be a\nsource of embarrassment to my friend. \u201cAll this occurred during the \ufb01rst month of the\nlong vacation. I went up to my London rooms,\nwhere I spent seven weeks working out a few ex-\nperiments in organic chemistry. One day, however,\nwhen the autumn was far advanced and the vaca-\ntion drawing to a close, I received a telegram from\nmy friend imploring me to return to Donnithorpe,\nand saying that he was in great need of my advice\nand assistance. Of course I dropped everything\nand set out for the North once more."

From a grove upon our left I could\nalready see the high chimneys and the \ufb02ag-staff\nwhich marked the squire\u2019s dwelling. \u201c \u2018My father made the fellow gardener,\u2019 said\nmy companion, \u2018and then, as that did not satisfy\nhim, he was promoted to be butler. The house\nseemed to be at his mercy, and he wandered about\nand did what he chose in it. The maids com-\nplained of his drunken habits and his vile lan-\nguage. The dad raised their wages all round to\nrecompense them for the annoyance. The fellow\nwould take the boat and my father\u2019s best gun and\ntreat himself to little shooting trips. And all this\nwith such a sneering, leering, insolent face that I\nwould have knocked him down twenty times over\nif he had been a man of my own age. I tell you,\nHolmes, I have had to keep a tight hold upon my-\nself all this time; and now I am asking myself\nwhether, if I had let myself go a little more, I might\nnot have been a wiser man. \u201c \u2018Well, matters went from bad to worse with\nus, and this animal Hudson became more and\nmore intrusive, until at last, on making some in-\nsolent reply to my father in my presence one day,\nI took him by the shoulders and turned him out of\nthe room."

He walked into the dining-\nroom as we sat after dinner, and announced his\nintention in the thick voice of a half-drunken man. \u201c \u2018 \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of Norfolk,\u201d said he. \u201cI\u2019ll\nrun down to Mr. Beddoes in Hampshire.

When I at last\ndrew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and eye-\nlids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that\nhe had a stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once.

As we\ndashed up to the door, my friend\u2019s face convulsed\nwith grief, a gentleman in black emerged from it. \u201c \u2018When did it happen, doctor?\u2019 asked Trevor. \u201c \u2018Almost immediately after you left.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Did he recover consciousness?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018For an instant before the end.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Any message for me?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Only that the papers were in the back drawer\nof the Japanese cabinet.\u2019\n320\nThe \u201cGloria Scott\u201d\n\u201cMy friend ascended with the doctor to the\nchamber of death, while I remained in the study,\nturning the whole matter over and over in my\nhead, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in\nmy life. What was the past of this Trevor, pugilist,\ntraveler, and gold-digger, and how had he placed\nhimself in the power of this acid-faced seaman? Why, too, should he faint at an allusion to the\nhalf-effaced initials upon his arm, and die of fright\nwhen he had a letter from Fordingham? Then I\nremembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire,\nand that this Mr. Beddoes, whom the seaman had\ngone to visit and presumably to blackmail, had\nalso been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The\nletter, then, might either come from Hudson, the\nseaman, saying that he had betrayed the guilty\nsecret which appeared to exist, or it might come\nfrom Beddoes, warning an old confederate that\nsuch a betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed\nclear enough. But then how could this letter be\ntrivial and grotesque, as described by the son? He\nmust have misread it. If so, it must have been one\nof those ingenious secret codes which mean one\nthing while they seem to mean another. I must\nsee this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in\nit, I was con\ufb01dent that I could pluck it forth. For\nan hour I sat pondering over it in the gloom, un-\ntil at last a weeping maid brought in a lamp, and\nclose at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but\ncomposed, with these very papers which lie upon\nmy knee held in his grasp. He sat down opposite\nto me, drew the lamp to the edge of the table, and\nhanded me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon\na single sheet of gray paper. \u2018The supply of game\nfor London is going steadily up,\u2019 it ran. \u2018Head-\nkeeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to\nreceive all orders for \ufb02y-paper and for preserva-\ntion of your hen-pheasant\u2019s life.\u2019\n\u201cI dare say my face looked as bewildered as\nyours did just now when \ufb01rst I read this message.

Such a meaning would be arbitrary and\ncould not be deduced in any way. And yet I was\nloath to believe that this was the case, and the pres-\nence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the\nsubject of the message was as I had guessed, and\nthat it was from Beddoes rather than the sailor. I\ntried it backwards, but the combination \u2018life pheas-\nant\u2019s hen\u2019 was not encouraging.

Do not think\nvery harshly of me, laddie. It was a debt of honor,\nso called, which I had to pay, and I used money\nwhich was not my own to do it, in the certainty\nthat I could replace it before there could be any\npossibility of its being missed. But the most dread-\nful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had\nreckoned upon never came to hand, and a prema-\nture examination of accounts exposed my de\ufb01cit.

The government was compelled, therefore, to use\nsmaller and less suitable vessels for sending out\ntheir prisoners. The Gloria Scott had been in the\nChinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,\nheavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new\nclippers had cut her out. She was a \ufb01ve-hundred-\nton boat; and besides her thirty-eight jail-birds, she\ncarried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a\ncaptain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four\nwarders. Nearly a hundred souls were in her, all\ntold, when we set said from Falmouth. \u201c \u2018The partitions between the cells of the con-\nvicts, instead of being of thick oak, as is usual in\nconvict-ships, were quite thin and frail. The man\nnext to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I\nhad particularly noticed when we were led down\nthe quay. He was a young man with a clear, hair-\nless face, a long, thin nose, and rather nut-cracker\njaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air,\nhad a swaggering style of walking, and was, above\nall else, remarkable for his extraordinary height. I\ndon\u2019t think any of our heads would have come up\nto his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not\nhave measured less than six and a half feet. It was\nstrange among so many sad and weary faces to see\none which was full of energy and resolution. The\nsight of it was to me like a \ufb01re in a snow-storm. I\nwas glad, then, to \ufb01nd that he was my neighbor,\nand gladder still when, in the dead of the night, I\nheard a whisper close to my ear, and found that\nhe had managed to cut an opening in the board\nwhich separated us. \u201c \u2018 \u201cHullo, chummy!\u201d said he, \u201cwhat\u2019s your\nname, and what are you here for?\u201c\n\u201c \u2018I answered him, and asked in turn who I was\ntalking with. \u201c \u2018 \u201cI\u2019m Jack Prendergast,\u201d said he, \u201cand by\nGod!

He came aboard with a black coat, and his\npapers right, and money enough in his box to buy\nthe thing right up from keel to main-truck. The\ncrew are his, body and soul. He could buy \u2019em at\nso much a gross with a cash discount, and he did\nit before ever they signed on.

His name was\nEvans, but he afterwards changed it, like myself,\nand he is now a rich and prosperous man in the\nsouth of England. He was ready enough to join\nthe conspiracy, as the only means of saving our-\nselves, and before we had crossed the Bay there\nwere only two of the prisoners who were not in\nthe secret."

The crew were a set of ruf\ufb01ans, specially picked\nfor the job. The sham chaplain came into our cells\nto exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be\nfull of tracts, and so often did he come that by the\nthird day we had each stowed away at the foot of\nour beds a \ufb01le, a brace of pistols, a pound of pow-\nder, and twenty slugs. Two of the warders were\nagents of Prendergast, and the second mate was\nhis right-hand man. The captain, the two mates,\ntwo warders Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen sol-\ndiers, and the doctor were all that we had against\nus. Yet, safe as it was, we determined to neglect\nno precaution, and to make our attack suddenly\nby night. It came, however, more quickly than we\nexpected, and in this way. \u201c \u2018One evening, about the third week after our\nstart, the doctor had come down to see one of the\nprisoners who was ill, and putting his hand down\non the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of\nthe pistols. If he had been silent he might have\nblown the whole thing, but he was a nervous lit-\ntle chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and turned\nso pale that the man knew what was up in an in-\nstant and seized him. He was gagged before he\ncould give the alarm, and tied down upon the bed. He had unlocked the door that led to the deck,\nand we were through it in a rush. The two sen-\ntries were shot down, and so was a corporal who\ncame running to see what was the matter. There\nwere two more soldiers at the door of the state-\nroom, and their muskets seemed not to be loaded,\nfor they never \ufb01red upon us, and they were shot\nwhile trying to \ufb01x their bayonets. Then we rushed\non into the captain\u2019s cabin, but as we pushed open\nthe door there was an explosion from within, and\nthere he lay with his brains smeared over the chart\nof the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table,\nwhile the chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in\nhis hand at his elbow. The two mates had both\nbeen seized by the crew, and the whole business\nseemed to be settled. \u201c \u2018The state-room was next the cabin, and we\n\ufb02ocked in there and \ufb02opped down on the settees,\nall speaking together, for we were just mad with\nthe feeling that we were free once more. There\n323\nThe \u201cGloria Scott\u201d\nwere lockers all round, and Wilson, the sham chap-\nlain, knocked one of them in, and pulled out a\ndozen of brown sherry."

When it cleared\nagain the place was a shambles. Wilson and eight\nothers were wriggling on the top of each other on\nthe \ufb02oor, and the blood and the brown sherry on\nthat table turn me sick now when I think of it. We\nwere so cowed by the sight that I think we should\nhave given the job up if had not been for Prender-\ngast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the\ndoor with all that were left alive at his heels. Out\nwe ran, and there on the poop were the lieutenent\nand ten of his men. The swing skylights above\nthe saloon table had been a bit open, and they had\n\ufb01red on us through the slit. We got on them be-\nfore they could load, and they stood to it like men;\nbut we had the upper hand of them, and in \ufb01ve\nminutes it was all over. My God! Was there ever a\nslaughter-house like that ship! Predergast was like\na raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if\nthey had been children and threw them overboard\nalive or dead. There was one sergeant that was\nhorribly wounded and yet kept on swimming for a\nsurprising time, until some one in mercy blew out\nhis brains. When the \ufb01ghting was over there was\nno one left of our enemies except just the warders\nthe mates, and the doctor. \u201c \u2018It was over them that the great quarrel arose.

It was one thing to\nknock the soldiers over with their muskets in their\nhands, and it was another to stand by while men\nwere being killed in cold blood. Eight of us, \ufb01ve\nconvicts and three sailors, said that we would not\nsee it done. But there was no moving Predergast\nand those who were with him. Our only chance of\nsafety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and\nhe would not leave a tongue with power to wag in\na witness-box. It nearly came to our sharing the\nfate of the prisoners, but at last he said that if we\nwished we might take a boat and go. We jumped\nat the offer, for we were already sick of these blook-\nthirsty doings, and we saw that there would be\nworse before it was done. We were given a suit of\nsailor togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one\nof junk and one of biscuits, and a compass. Pren-\ndergast threw us over a chart, told us that we were\nshipwrecked mariners whose ship had foundered\nin Lat."

The seamen had hauled\nthe fore-yard aback during the rising, but now as\nwe left them they brought it square again, and as\nthere was a light wind from the north and east\nthe bark began to draw slowly away from us. Our\nboat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth\nrollers, and Evans and I, who were the most edu-\ncated of the party, were sitting in the sheets work-\ning out our position and planning what coast we\nshould make for. It was a nice question, for the\nCape de Verds were about \ufb01ve hundred miles to\nthe north of us, and the African coast about seven\nhundred to the east. On the whole, as the wind\nwas coming round to the north, we thought that\nSierra Leone might be best, and turned our head\nin that direction, the bark being at that time nearly\nhull down on our starboard quarter. Suddenly as\nwe looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of\nsmoke shoot up from her, which hung like a mon-\nstrous tree upon the sky line. A few seconds later\na roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as\nthe smoke thinned away there was no sign left of\nthe Gloria Scott. In an instant we swept the boat\u2019s\nhead round again and pulled with all our strength\nfor the place where the haze still trailing over the\nwater marked the scene of this catastrophe. \u201c \u2018It was a long hour before we reached it, and\nat \ufb01rst we feared that we had come too late to save\nany one. A splintered boat and a number of crates\nand fragments of spars rising and falling on the\nwaves showed us where the vessel had foundered;\nbut there was no sign of life, and we had turned\naway in despair when we heard a cry for help, and\nsaw at some distance a piece of wreckage with a\nman lying stretched across it. When we pulled him\naboard the boat he proved to be a young seaman of\nthe name of Hudson, who was so burned and ex-\nhausted that he could give us no account of what\nhad happened until the following morning. \u201c \u2018It seemed that after we had left, Prendergast\nand his gang had proceeded to put to death the\n\ufb01ve remaining prisoners. The two warders had\nbeen shot and thrown overboard, and so also had\nthe third mate. Prendergast then descended into\nthe \u2019tween-decks and with his own hands cut the\nthroat of the unfortunate surgeon. There only re-\nmained the \ufb01rst mate, who was a bold and active\nman. When he saw the convict approaching him\nwith the bloody knife in his hand he kicked off\nhis bonds, which he had somehow contrived to\nloosen, and rushing down the deck he plunged\ninto the after-hold."

Next day we were picked up by the brig\nHotspur, bound for Australia, whose captain found\nno dif\ufb01culty in believing that we were the sur-\nvivors of a passenger ship which had foundered. The transport ship Gloria Scott was set down by\nthe Admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word\nhas ever leaked out as to her true fate. After an\nexcellent voyage the Hotspur landed us at Sydney,\nwhere Evans and I changed our names and made\nour way to the diggings, where, among the crowds\nwho were gathered from all nations, we had no\ndif\ufb01culty in losing our former identities. The rest\nI need not relate. We prospered, we traveled, we\ncame back as rich colonials to England, and we\nbought country estates. For more than twenty\nyears we have led peaceful and useful lives, and\nwe hoped that our past was forever buried. Imag-\nine, then, my feelings when in the seaman who\ncame to us I recognized instantly the man who\nhad been picked off the wreck. He had tracked us\ndown somehow, and had set himself to live upon\nour fears. You will understand now how it was\nthat I strove to keep the peace with him, and you\nwill in some measure sympathize with me in the\nfears which \ufb01ll me, now that he has gone from me\nto his other victim with threats upon his tongue.\u2019\n\u201cUnderneath is written in a hand so shaky as\nto be hardly legible, \u2018Beddoes writes in cipher to\nsay H. has told all.

The good\nfellow was heart-broken at it, and went out to the\nTerai tea planting, where I hear that he is doing\nwell. As to the sailor and Beddoes, neither of them\nwas ever heard of again after that day on which\nthe letter of warning was written. They both dis-\nappeared utterly and completely. No complaint\nhad been lodged with he police, so that Beddoes\nhad mistaken a threat for a deed. Hudson had\nbeen seen lurking about, and it was believed by\nthe police that he had done away with Beddoes\nand had \ufb02ed."

Those are the facts of the case,\nDoctor, and if they are of any use to your collec-\ntion, I am sure that they are very heartily at your\nservice.\u201d\nThe Musgrave Ritual\nThe Musgrave Ritual\nA\nn anomaly which often struck me in the\ncharacter of my friend Sherlock Holmes\nwas that, although in his methods of\nthought he was the neatest and most me-\nthodical of mankind, and although also he affected\na certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the\nless in his personal habits one of the most un-\ntidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to dis-\ntraction. Not that I am in the least conventional in\nthat respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work\nin Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural\nBohemianism of disposition, has made me rather\nmore lax than be\ufb01ts a medical man. But with me\nthere is a limit, and when I \ufb01nd a man who keeps\nhis cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe\nend of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered corre-\nspondence trans\ufb01xed by a jack-knife into the very\ncentre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to\ngive myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too,\nthat pistol practice should be distinctly an open-\nair pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer\nhumors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-\ntrigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and pro-\nceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.\nR. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither\nthe atmosphere nor the appearance of our room\nwas improved by it. Our chambers were always full of chemicals\nand of criminal relics which had a way of wan-\ndering into unlikely positions, and of turning up\nin the butter-dish or in even less desirable places. But his papers were my great crux. He had a\nhorror of destroying documents, especially those\nwhich were connected with his past cases, and yet\nit was only once in every year or two that he would\nmuster energy to docket and arrange them; for, as\nI have mentioned somewhere in these incoherent\nmemoirs, the outbursts of passionate energy when\nhe performed the remarkable feats with which his\nname is associated were followed by reactions of\nlethargy during which he would lie about with his\nviolin and his books, hardly moving save from the\nsofa to the table. Thus month after month his pa-\npers accumulated, until every corner of the room\nwas stacked with bundles of manuscript which\nwere on no account to be burned, and which could\nnot be put away save by their owner. One winter\u2019s\nnight, as we sat together by the \ufb01re, I ventured\nto suggest to him that, as he had \ufb01nished past-\ning extracts into his common-place book, he might\nemploy the next two hours in making our room a\nlittle more habitable."

You can hardly realize, then,\nhow dif\ufb01cult I found it at \ufb01rst, and how long I had\nto wait before I succeeded in making any headway. \u201cWhen I \ufb01rst came up to London I had rooms\nin Montague Street, just round the corner from the\nBritish Museum, and there I waited, \ufb01lling in my\ntoo abundant leisure time by studying all those\nbranches of science which might make me more\nef\ufb01cient. Now and again cases came in my way,\nprincipally through the introduction of old fellow-\nstudents, for during my last years at the University\nthere was a good deal of talk there about myself\nand my methods. The third of these cases was\nthat of the Musgrave Ritual, and it is to the inter-\nest which was aroused by that singular chain of\nevents, and the large issues which proved to be at\nstake, that I trace my \ufb01rst stride towards to the po-\nsition which I now hold. \u201cReginald Musgrave had been in the same col-\nlege as myself, and I had some slight acquaintance\nwith him. He was not generally popular among\nthe undergraduates, though it always seemed to\nme that what was set down as pride was really an\nattempt to cover extreme natural dif\ufb01dence. In ap-\npearance he was a man of exceedingly aristocratic\ntype, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with lan-\nguid and yet courtly manners. He was indeed a\nscion of one of the very oldest families in the king-\ndom, though his branch was a cadet one which\nhad separated from the northern Musgraves some\ntime in the sixteenth century, and had established\nitself in western Sussex, where the Manor House\nof Hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited build-\ning in the county. Something of his birth place\nseemed to cling to the man, and I never looked at\nhis pale, keen face or the poise of his head without\nassociating him with gray archways and mullioned\nwindows and all the venerable wreckage of a feu-\ndal keep. Once or twice we drifted into talk, and\nI can remember that more than once he expressed\na keen interest in my methods of observation and\ninference. \u201cFor four years I had seen nothing of him un-\ntil one morning he walked into my room in Mon-\ntague Street."

The\ngarden and the stables of course have a separate\nstaff. \u201c \u2018Of these servants the one who had been\nlongest in our service was Brunton the butler. He\nwas a young school-master out of place when he\n330\nThe Musgrave Ritual\nwas \ufb01rst taken up by my father, but he was a man\nof great energy and character, and he soon became\nquite invaluable in the household. He was a well-\ngrown, handsome man, with a splendid forehead,\nand though he has been with us for twenty years\nhe cannot be more than forty now. With his per-\nsonal advantages and his extraordinary gifts\u2014for\nhe can speak several languages and play nearly\nevery musical instrument\u2014it is wonderful that he\nshould have been satis\ufb01ed so long in such a posi-\ntion, but I suppose that he was comfortable, and\nlacked energy to make any change. The butler of\nHurlstone is always a thing that is remembered by\nall who visit us. \u201c \u2018But this paragon has one fault."

When he was married\nit was all right, but since he has been a widower\nwe have had no end of trouble with him. A few\nmonths ago we were in hopes that he was about\nto settle down again for he became engaged to\nRachel Howells, our second house-maid; but he\nhas thrown her over since then and taken up with\nJanet Tregellis, the daughter of the head game-\nkeeper. Rachel\u2014who is a very good girl, but of an\nexcitable Welsh temperament\u2014had a sharp touch\nof brain-fever, and goes about the house now\u2014or\ndid until yesterday\u2014like a black-eyed shadow of\nher former self. That was our \ufb01rst drama at Hurl-\nstone; but a second one came to drive it from our\nminds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and\ndismissal of butler Brunton. \u201c \u2018This was how it came about. I have said that\nthe man was intelligent, and this very intelligence\nhas caused his ruin, for it seems to have led to an\ninsatiable curiosity about things which did not in\nthe least concern him. I had no idea of the lengths\nto which this would carry him, until the merest\naccident opened my eyes to it. \u201c \u2018I have said that the house is a rambling one. One day last week\u2014on Thursday night, to be more\nexact\u2014I found that I could not sleep, having fool-\nishly taken a cup of strong caf\u00b4e noir after my din-\nner. After struggling against it until two in the\nmorning, I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose\nand lit the candle with the intention of continuing\na novel which I was reading. The book, however,\nhad been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on\nmy dressing-gown and started off to get it. \u201c \u2018In order to reach the billiard-room I had to\ndescend a \ufb02ight of stairs and then to cross the head\nof a passage which led to the library and the gun-\nroom. You can imagine my surprise when, as I\nlooked down this corridor, I saw a glimmer of light\ncoming from the open door of the library. I had\nmyself extinguished the lamp and closed the door\nbefore coming to bed. Naturally my \ufb01rst thought\nwas of burglars. The corridors at Hurlstone have\ntheir walls largely decorated with trophies of old\nweapons. From one of these I picked a battle-axe,\nand then, leaving my candle behind me, I crept on\ntiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open\ndoor. \u201c \u2018Brunton, the butler, was in the library. He\nwas sitting, fully dressed, in an easy-chair, with a\nslip of paper which looked like a map upon his\nknee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his\nhand in deep thought. I stood dumb with as-\ntonishment, watching him from the darkness."

Suddenly, as I looked, he rose from his\nchair, and walking over to a bureau at the side, he\nunlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. From\nthis he took a paper, and returning to his seat he\n\ufb02attened it out beside the taper on the edge of the\ntable, and began to study it with minute attention. My indignation at this calm examination of our\nfamily documents overcame me so far that I took\na step forward, and Brunton, looking up, saw me\nstanding in the doorway. He sprang to his feet,\nhis face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into\nhis breast the chart-like paper which he had been\noriginally studying. \u201c \u2018 \u201cSo!\u201d said I. \u201cThis is how you repay the trust\nwhich we have reposed in you. You will leave my\nservice to-morrow.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018He bowed with the look of a man who is ut-\nterly crushed, and slunk past me without a word. The taper was still on the table, and by its light\nI glanced to see what the paper was which Brun-\nton had taken from the bureau. To my surprise it\nwas nothing of any importance at all, but simply\na copy of the questions and answers in the singu-\nlar old observance called the Musgrave Ritual. It\nis a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which\neach Musgrave for centuries past has gone through\non his coming of age\u2014a thing of private interest,\nand perhaps of some little importance to the ar-\nchaeologist, like our own blazonings and charges,\nbut of no practical use whatever.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018We had better come back to the paper after-\nwards,\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018If you think it really necessary,\u2019 he answered,\nwith some hesitation. \u2018To continue my statement,\nhowever:\nI relocked the bureau, using the key\nwhich Brunton had left, and I had turned to go\n331\nThe Musgrave Ritual\nwhen I was surprised to \ufb01nd that the butler had\nreturned, and was standing before me. \u201c \u2018 \u201cMr. Musgrave, sir,\u201d he cried, in a voice\nwhich was hoarse with emotion, \u201cI can\u2019t bear dis-\ngrace, sir. I\u2019ve always been proud above my station\nin life, and disgrace would kill me. My blood will\nbe on your head, sir\u2014it will, indeed\u2014if you drive\nme to despair. If you cannot keep me after what\nhas passed, then for God\u2019s sake let me give you\nnotice and leave in a month, as if of my own free\nwill. I could stand that, Mr. Musgrave, but not to\nbe cast out before all the folk that I know so well.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve much consideration,\nBrunton,\u201d I answered. \u201cYour conduct has been\nmost infamous.

I made no al-\nlusion to what had passed, and waited with some\ncuriosity to see how he would cover his disgrace.

The\ngirl was taken to her room, still screaming and sob-\nbing, while I made inquiries about Brunton. There\nwas no doubt about it that he had disappeared. His bed had not been slept in, he had been seen by\nno one since he had retired to his room the night\nbefore, and yet it was dif\ufb01cult to see how he could\nhave left the house, as both windows and doors\nwere found to be fastened in the morning. His\nclothes, his watch, and even his money were in his\nroom, but the black suit which he usually wore\nwas missing. His slippers, too, were gone, but his\nboots were left behind. Where then could butler\nBrunton have gone in the night, and what could\nhave become of him now? \u201c \u2018Of course we searched the house from cellar\nto garret, but there was no trace of him. It is, as\nI have said, a labyrinth of an old house, especially\nthe original wing, which is now practically unin-\nhabited; but we ransacked every room and cellar\nwithout discovering the least sign of the missing\nman."

Over\nthe low, heavily-lintelled door, in the centre of this\nold part, is chiseled the date, 1607, but experts are\nagreed that the beams and stone-work are really\nmuch older than this. The enormously thick walls\nand tiny windows of this part had in the last cen-\ntury driven the family into building the new wing,\nand the old one was used now as a store-house\nand a cellar, when it was used at all. A splen-\ndid park with \ufb01ne old timber surrounds the house,\nand the lake, to which my client had referred, lay\n333\nThe Musgrave Ritual\nclose to the avenue, about two hundred yards from\nthe building. \u201cI was already \ufb01rmly convinced, Watson, that\nthere were not three separate mysteries here, but\none only, and that if I could read the Musgrave\nRitual aright I should hold in my hand the clue\nwhich would lead me to the truth concerning both\nthe butler Brunton and the maid Howells. To that\nthen I turned all my energies. Why should this ser-\nvant be so anxious to master this old formula? Ev-\nidently because he saw something in it which had\nescaped all those generations of country squires,\nand from which he expected some personal advan-\ntage. What was it then, and how had it affected his\nfate? \u201cIt was perfectly obvious to me, on reading the\nritual, that the measurements must refer to some\nspot to which the rest of the document alluded,\nand that if we could \ufb01nd that spot, we should be\nin a fair way towards \ufb01nding what the secret was\nwhich the old Musgraves had thought it necessary\nto embalm in so curious a fashion. There were\ntwo guides given us to start with, an oak and an\nelm. As to the oak there could be no question at\nall. Right in front of the house, upon the left-hand\nside of the drive, there stood a patriarch among\noaks, one of the most magni\ufb01cent trees that I have\never seen. \u201c \u2018That was there when your ritual was drawn\nup,\u2019 said I, as we drove past it. \u201c \u2018It was there at the Norman Conquest in all\nprobability,\u2019 he answered. \u2018It has a girth of twenty-\nthree feet.\u2019\n\u201cHere was one of my \ufb01xed points secured. \u201c \u2018Have you any old elms?\u2019 I asked. \u201c \u2018There used to be a very old one over yonder\nbut it was struck by lightning ten years ago, and\nwe cut down the stump,\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You can see where it used to be?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Oh, yes.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018There are no other elms?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018No old ones, but plenty of beeches.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I should like to see where it grew.\u2019\n\u201cWe had driven up in a dogcart, and my client\nled me away at once, without our entering the\nhouse, to the scar on the lawn where the elm had\nstood."

I looked\nup at the sun. It was low in the heavens, and I cal-\nculated that in less than an hour it would lie just\nabove the topmost branches of the old oak. One\ncondition mentioned in the Ritual would then be\nful\ufb01lled. And the shadow of the elm must mean\nthe farther end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk\nwould have been chosen as the guide. I had, then,\nto \ufb01nd where the far end of the shadow would fall\nwhen the sun was just clear of the oak.\u201d\n\u201cThat must have been dif\ufb01cult, Holmes, when\nthe elm was no longer there.\u201d\n\u201cWell, at least I knew that if Brunton could do\nit, I could also. Besides, there was no real dif\ufb01culty. I went with Musgrave to his study and whittled\nmyself this peg, to which I tied this long string\nwith a knot at each yard. Then I took two lengths\nof a \ufb01shing-rod, which came to just six feet, and\nI went back with my client to where the elm had\nbeen. The sun was just grazing the top of the oak. I fastened the rod on end, marked out the direc-\ntion of the shadow, and measured it. It was nine\nfeet in length. \u201cOf course the calculation now was a simple\none. If a rod of six feet threw a shadow of nine, a\ntree of sixty-four feet would throw one of ninety-\nsix, and the line of the one would of course the line\nof the other. I measured out the distance, which\nbrought me almost to the wall of the house, and\nI thrust a peg into the spot. You can imagine my\nexultation, Watson, when within two inches of my\npeg I saw a conical depression in the ground. I\nknew that it was the mark made by Brunton in his\nmeasurements, and that I was still upon his trail."

Ten steps with each foot took me\nalong parallel with the wall of the house, and again\nI marked my spot with a peg. Then I carefully\npaced off \ufb01ve to the east and two to the south. It\nbrought me to the very threshold of the old door. Two steps to the west meant now that I was to\ngo two paces down the stone-\ufb02agged passage, and\nthis was the place indicated by the Ritual. \u201cNever have I felt such a cold chill of disap-\npointment, Watson. For a moment is seemed to\nme that there must be some radical mistake in my\ncalculations. The setting sun shone full upon the\npassage \ufb02oor, and I could see that the old, foot-\nworn gray stones with which it was paved were\n\ufb01rmly cemented together, and had certainly not\nbeen moved for many a long year. Brunton had\nnot been at work here. I tapped upon the \ufb02oor,\nbut it sounded the same all over, and there was no\nsign of any crack or crevice. But, Fortunately, Mus-\ngrave, who had begun to appreciate the meaning\nof my proceedings, and who was now as excited\nas myself, took out his manuscript to check my\ncalculation. \u201c \u2018And under,\u2019 he cried. \u2018You have omitted the\n\u201cand under.\u201d \u2019\n\u201cI had thought that it meant that we were to\ndig, but now, of course, I saw at once that I was\nwrong. \u2018There is a cellar under this then?\u2019 I cried. \u201c \u2018Yes, and as old as the house.

I have seen it on him, and could swear to\nit. What has the villain been doing here?\u2019\n\u201cAt my suggestion a couple of the county po-\nlice were summoned to be present, and I then en-\ndeavored to raise the stone by pulling on the cra-\nvat. I could only move it slightly, and it was with\nthe aid of one of the constables that I succeeded at\nlast in carrying it to one side.

At one side of\nthis was a squat, brass-bound wooden box, the lid\nof which was hinged upwards, with this curious\nold-fashioned key projecting from the lock. It was\nfurred outside by a thick layer of dust, and damp\nand worms had eaten through the wood, so that a\ncrop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it. Several discs of metal, old coins apparently, such\nas I hold here, were scattered over the bottom of\nthe box, but it contained nothing else. \u201cAt the moment, however, we had no thought\nfor the old chest, for our eyes were riveted upon\nthat which crouched beside it. It was the \ufb01gure of\na man, clad in a suit of black, who squatted down\nupon his hams with his forehead sunk upon the\nedge of the box and his two arms thrown out on\neach side of it. The attitude had drawn all the stag-\nnant blood to the face, and no man could have rec-\nognized that distorted liver-colored countenance;\nbut his height, his dress, and his hair were all suf-\n\ufb01cient to show my client, when we had drawn the\nbody up, that it was indeed his missing butler. He\nhad been dead some days, but there was no wound\nor bruise upon his person to show how he had met\nhis dreadful end. When his body had been carried\nfrom the cellar we found ourselves still confronted\nwith a problem which was almost as formidable as\nthat with which we had started. \u201cI confess that so far, Watson, I had been disap-\npointed in my investigation. I had reckoned upon\nsolving the matter when once I had found the\nplace referred to in the Ritual; but now I was there,\nand was apparently as far as ever from knowing\nwhat it was which the family had concealed with\nsuch elaborate precautions. It is true that I had\nthrown a light upon the fate of Brunton, but now\nI had to ascertain how that fate had come upon\nhim, and what part had been played in the matter\nby the woman who had disappeared. I sat down\nupon a keg in the corner and thought the whole\nmatter carefully over. \u201cYou know my methods in such cases, Wat-\nson. I put myself in the man\u2019s place and, having\n\ufb01rst gauged his intelligence, I try to imagine how\nI should myself have proceeded under the same\ncircumstances. In this case the matter was simpli-\n\ufb01ed by Brunton\u2019s intelligence being quite \ufb01rst-rate,\nso that it was unnecessary to make any allowance\nfor the personal equation, as the astronomers have\ndubbed it. He knew that something valuable was\n335\nThe Musgrave Ritual\nconcealed. He had spotted the place. He found\nthat the stone which covered it was just too heavy\nfor a man to move unaided. What would he do\nnext? He could not get help from outside, even\nif he had some one whom he could trust, with-\nout the unbarring of doors and considerable risk\nof detection."

A man\nalways \ufb01nds it hard to realize that he may have \ufb01-\nnally lost a woman\u2019s love, however badly he may\nhave treated her. He would try by a few attentions\nto make his peace with the girl Howells, and then\nwould engage her as his accomplice. Together they\nwould come at night to the cellar, and their united\nforce would suf\ufb01ce to raise the stone. So far I could\nfollow their actions as if I had actually seen them. \u201cBut for two of them, and one a woman, it must\nhave been heavy work the raising of that stone. A\nburly Sussex policeman and I had found it no light\njob. What would they do to assist them? Probably\nwhat I should have done myself. I rose and exam-\nined carefully the different billets of wood which\nwere scattered round the \ufb02oor. Almost at once\nI came upon what I expected. One piece, about\nthree feet in length, had a very marked indenta-\ntion at one end, while several were \ufb02attened at the\nsides as if they had been compressed by some con-\nsiderable weight. Evidently, as they had dragged\nthe stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood\ninto the chink, until at last, when the opening was\nlarge enough to crawl through, they would hold\nit open by a billet placed lengthwise, which might\nvery well become indented at the lower end, since\nthe whole weight of the stone would press it down\non to the edge of this other slab. So far I was still\non safe ground. \u201cAnd now how was I to proceed to recon-\nstruct this midnight drama? Clearly, only one\ncould \ufb01t into the hole, and that one was Brunton. The girl must have waited above. Brunton then\nunlocked the box, handed up the contents pre-\nsumably\u2014since they were not to be found\u2014and\nthen\u2014and then what happened? \u201cWhat smouldering \ufb01re of vengeance had sud-\ndenly sprung into \ufb02ame in this passionate Celtic\nwoman\u2019s soul when she saw the man who had\nwronged her\u2014wronged her, perhaps, far more\nthan we suspected\u2014in her power? Was it a chance\nthat the wood had slipped, and that the stone had\nshut Brunton into what had become his sepulchre? Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate? Or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed\nthe support away and sent the slab crashing down\ninto its place? Be that as it might, I seemed to see\nthat woman\u2019s \ufb01gure still clutching at her treasure\ntrove and \ufb02ying wildly up the winding stair, with\nher ears ringing perhaps with the muf\ufb02ed screams\nfrom behind her and with the drumming of fren-\nzied hands against the slab of stone which was\nchoking her faithless lover\u2019s life out. \u201cHere was the secret of her blanched face, her\nshaken nerves, her peals of hysterical laughter on\nthe next morning."

She had thrown\nthem in there at the \ufb01rst opportunity to remove the\nlast trace of her crime. \u201cFor twenty minutes I had sat motionless,\nthinking the matter out. Musgrave still stood with\na very pale face, swinging his lantern and peering\ndown into the hole. \u201c \u2018These are coins of Charles the First,\u2019 said he,\nholding out the few which had been in the box;\n\u2018you see we were right in \ufb01xing our date for the\nRitual.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018We may \ufb01nd something else of Charles the\nFirst,\u2019 I cried, as the probable meaning of the \ufb01rst\ntwo question of the Ritual broke suddenly upon\nme. \u2018Let me see the contents of the bag which you\n\ufb01shed from the mere.\u2019\n\u201cWe ascended to his study, and he laid the de-\nbris before me. I could understand his regarding\nit as of small importance when I looked at it, for\nthe metal was almost black and the stones lustre-\nless and dull. I rubbed one of them on my sleeve,\nhowever, and it glowed afterwards like a spark in\nthe dark hollow of my hand. The metal work was\nin the form of a double ring, but it had been bent\nand twisted out of its original shape. \u201c \u2018You must bear in mind,\u2019 said I, \u2018that the royal\nparty made head in England even after the death\nof the king, and that when they at last \ufb02ed they\nprobably left many of their most precious posses-\nsions buried behind them, with the intention of\nreturning for them in more peaceful times.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018My ancestor, Sir Ralph Musgrave, was a\nprominent Cavalier and the right-hand man of\nCharles the Second in his wanderings,\u2019 said my\nfriend. \u201c \u2018Ah, indeed!\u2019 I answered. \u2018Well now, I think\nthat really should give us the last link that we\nwanted. I must congratulate you on coming into\nthe possession, though in rather a tragic manner of\na relic which is of great intrinsic value, but of even\ngreater importance as an historical curiosity.\u2019\n336\n\u201c \u2018What is it, then?\u2019 he gasped in astonishment. \u201c \u2018It is nothing less than the ancient crown of\nthe kings of England.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018The crown!\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Precisely. Consider what the Ritual says:\nHow does it run? \u201cWhose was it?\u201d \u201cHis who is\ngone.\u201d That was after the execution of Charles. Then, \u201cWho shall have it?\u201d \u201cHe who will come.\u201d\nThat was Charles the Second, whose advent was\nalready foreseen. There can, I think, be no doubt\nthat this battered and shapeless diadem once en-\ncircled the brows of the royal Stuarts.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And how came it in the pond?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Ah, that is a question that will take some\ntime to answer.\u2019 And with that I sketched out to\nhim the whole long chain of surmise and of proof\nwhich I had constructed."

It is likely that the Musgrave who held\nthe secret died in the interval, and by some over-\nsight left this guide to his descendant without ex-\nplaining the meaning of it.

I am sure that if you mentioned my\nname they would be happy to show it to you. Of\nthe woman nothing was ever heard, and the prob-\nability is that she got away out of England and car-\nried herself and the memory of her crime to some\nland beyond the seas.\u201d\nThe Reigate Puzzle\nThe Reigate Puzzle\nI\nt was some time before the health of my\nfriend Mr. Sherlock Holmes recovered\nfrom the strain caused by his immense\nexertions in the spring of \u201987. The whole\nquestion of the Netherland-Sumatra Company and\nof the colossal schemes of Baron Maupertuis are\ntoo recent in the minds of the public, and are too\nintimately concerned with politics and \ufb01nance to\nbe \ufb01tting subjects for this series of sketches. They\nled, however, in an indirect fashion to a singular\nand complex problem which gave my friend an\nopportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh\nweapon among the many with which he waged his\nlife-long battle against crime. On referring to my notes I see that it was upon\nthe 14th of April that I received a telegram from\nLyons which informed me that Holmes was lying\nill in the Hotel Dulong. Within twenty-four hours I\nwas in his sick-room, and was relieved to \ufb01nd that\nthere was nothing formidable in his symptoms. Even his iron constitution, however, had broken\ndown under the strain of an investigation which\nhad extended over two months, during which pe-\nriod he had never worked less than \ufb01fteen hours\na day, and had more than once, as he assured me,\nkept to his task for \ufb01ve days at a stretch. Even the\ntriumphant issue of his labors could not save him\nfrom reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at\na time when Europe was ringing with his name\nand when his room was literally ankle-deep with\ncongratulatory telegrams I found him a prey to the\nblackest depression. Even the knowledge that he\nhad succeeded where the police of three countries\nhad failed, and that he had outmanoeuvred at ev-\nery point the most accomplished swindler in Eu-\nrope, was insuf\ufb01cient to rouse him from his ner-\nvous prostration."

        "text": "Three days later we were back in Baker Street\ntogether; but it was evident that my friend would\nbe much the better for a change, and the thought\nof a week of spring time in the country was full\nof attractions to me also. My old friend, Colonel\nHayter, who had come under my professional\ncare in Afghanistan, had now taken a house near\nReigate in Surrey, and had frequently asked me to\ncome down to him upon a visit. On the last oc-\ncasion he had remarked that if my friend would\nonly come with me he would be glad to extend\nhis hospitality to him also. A little diplomacy was\nneeded, but when Holmes understood that the es-\ntablishment was a bachelor one, and that he would\nbe allowed the fullest freedom, he fell in with my\nplans and a week after our return from Lyons we\nwere under the Colonel\u2019s roof. Hayter was a \ufb01ne\nold soldier who had seen much of the world, and\nhe soon found, as I had expected, that Holmes and\nhe had much in common. On the evening of our arrival we were sitting\nin the Colonel\u2019s gun-room after dinner, Holmes\nstretched upon the sofa, while Hayter and I looked\nover his little armory of Eastern weapons. \u201cBy the way,\u201d said he suddenly, \u201cI think I\u2019ll\ntake one of these pistols upstairs with me in case\nwe have an alarm.\u201d\n\u201cAn alarm!\u201d said I. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had a scare in this part lately. Old\nActon, who is one of our county magnates, had his\nhouse broken into last Monday. No great damage\ndone, but the fellows are still at large.\u201d\n\u201cNo clue?\u201d asked Holmes, cocking his eye at\nthe Colonel. \u201cNone as yet. But the affair is a pretty one,\none of our little country crimes, which must seem\ntoo small for your attention, Mr. Holmes, after this\ngreat international affair.\u201d\nHolmes waved away the compliment, though\nhis smile showed that it had pleased him. \u201cWas there any feature of interest?\u201d\n\u201cI fancy not. The thieves ransacked the library\nand got very little for their pains. The whole place\nwas turned upside down, drawers burst open, and\npresses ransacked, with the result that an odd vol-\nume of Pope\u2019s Homer, two plated candlesticks, an\nivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a\nball of twine are all that have vanished.\u201d\n\u201cWhat an extraordinary assortment!\u201d I ex-\nclaimed. \u201cOh, the fellows evidently grabbed hold of ev-\nerything they could get.\u201d\nHolmes grunted from the sofa. \u201cThe county police ought to make something\nof that,\u201d said he; \u201cwhy, it is surely obvious that\u2014\u201d\nBut I held up a warning \ufb01nger. \u201cYou are here for a rest, my dear fellow. For\nHeaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t get started on a new problem\nwhen your nerves are all in shreds.\u201d\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance\nof comic resignation towards the Colonel, and the\ntalk drifted away into less dangerous channels. It was destined, however, that all my profes-\nsional caution should be wasted, for next morning\nthe problem obtruded itself upon us in such a way\nthat it was impossible to ignore it, and our country\nvisit took a turn which neither of us could have an-\nticipated."

A gang of burglars acting\nin the country might be expected to vary the scene\nof their operations, and not to crack two cribs in\nthe same district within a few days. When you\nspoke last night of taking precautions I remem-\nber that it passed through my mind that this was\nprobably the last parish in England to which the\nthief or thieves would be likely to turn their atten-\ntion\u2014which shows that I have still much to learn.\u201d\n\u201cI fancy it\u2019s some local practitioner,\u201d said the\nColonel. \u201cIn that case, of course, Acton\u2019s and\nCunningham\u2019s are just the places he would go for,\nsince they are far the largest about here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd richest?\u201d\n\u201cWell, they ought to be, but they\u2019ve had a law-\nsuit for some years which has sucked the blood out\nof both of them, I fancy. Old Acton has some claim\non half Cunningham\u2019s estate, and the lawyers have\nbeen at it with both hands.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a local villain there should not be much\ndif\ufb01culty in running him down,\u201d said Holmes\nwith a yawn. \u201cAll right, Watson, I don\u2019t intend\nto meddle.\u201d\n\u201cInspector\nForrester,\nsir,\u201d\nsaid\nthe\nbutler,\nthrowing open the door.

Look at this!\u201d\nHe took a small piece of torn paper from a\nnote-book and spread it out upon his knee. \u201cThis was found between the \ufb01nger and thumb\nof the dead man. It appears to be a fragment torn\nfrom a larger sheet. You will observe that the hour\nmentioned upon it is the very time at which the\npoor fellow met his fate. You see that his mur-\nderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from\nhim or he might have taken this fragment from the\nmurderer.

That was of great interest.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.\u201d\n\u201cThen we had a look at this poor fellow\u2019s\nmother. We could get no information from her,\nhowever, as she is very old and feeble.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is the result of your investigations?\u201d\n\u201cThe conviction that the crime is a very pecu-\nliar one. Perhaps our visit now may do something\nto make it less obscure. I think that we are both\nagreed, Inspector that the fragment of paper in the\ndead man\u2019s hand, bearing, as it does, the very hour\nof his death written upon it, is of extreme impor-\ntance.\u201d\n\u201cIt should give a clue, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cIt does give a clue. Whoever wrote that note\nwas the man who brought William Kirwan out of\nhis bed at that hour. But where is the rest of that\nsheet of paper?\u201d\n\u201cI examined the ground carefully in the hope\nof \ufb01nding it,\u201d said the Inspector. \u201cIt was torn out of the dead man\u2019s hand. Why\nwas some one so anxious to get possession of it? Because it incriminated him. And what would he\ndo with it? Thrust it into his pocket, most likely,\nnever noticing that a corner of it had been left in\nthe grip of the corpse. If we could get the rest of\nthat sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a\nlong way towards solving the mystery.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but how can we get at the criminal\u2019s\npocket before we catch the criminal?\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, it was worth thinking over. Then\nthere is another obvious point. The note was sent\nto William. The man who wrote it could not have\ntaken it; otherwise, of course, he might have de-\nlivered his own message by word of mouth. Who\nbrought the note, then? Or did it come through\nthe post?\u201d\n\u201cI have made inquiries,\u201d said the Inspector. \u201cWilliam received a letter by the afternoon post\nyesterday. The envelope was destroyed by him.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d cried Holmes, clapping the Inspec-\ntor on the back. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the postman. It is a\npleasure to work with you. Well, here is the lodge,\nand if you will come up, Colonel, I will show you\nthe scene of the crime.\u201d\nWe passed the pretty cottage where the mur-\ndered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined\navenue to the \ufb01ne old Queen Anne house, which\nbears the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the\ndoor. Holmes and the Inspector led us round it\nuntil we came to the side gate, which is separated\nby a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines\nthe road."

Old Mr. Cunningham was at\nthat window\u2014the second on the left\u2014and he saw\nthe fellow get away just to the left of that bush. So did the son.They are both sure of it on account\nof the bush. Then Mr. Alec ran out and knelt be-\nside the wounded man. The ground is very hard,\nyou see, and there are no marks to guide us.\u201d As\nhe spoke two men came down the garden path,\nfrom round the angle of the house. The one was\nan elderly man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-\neyed face; the other a dashing young fellow, whose\nbright, smiling expression and showy dress were\nin strange contract with the business which had\nbrought us there. \u201cStill at it, then?\u201d said he to Holmes. \u201cI thought\nyou Londoners were never at fault. You don\u2019t seem\nto be so very quick, after all.\u201d\n\u201cAh, you must give us a little time,\u201d said\nHolmes good-humoredly. \u201cYou\u2019ll want it,\u201d said young Alec Cunningham. \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t see that we have any clue at all.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one,\u201d answered the Inspector. \u201cWe thought that if we could only \ufb01nd\u2014Good\nheavens, Mr. Holmes! What is the matter?\u201d\nMy poor friend\u2019s face had suddenly assumed\nthe most dreadful expression. His eyes rolled up-\nwards, his features writhed in agony, and with a\nsuppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the\nground. Horri\ufb01ed at the suddenness and sever-\nity of the attack, we carried him into the kitchen,\nwhere he lay back in a large chair, and breathed\nheavily for some minutes. Finally, with a shame-\nfaced apology for his weakness, he rose once more. \u201cWatson would tell you that I have only just re-\ncovered from a severe illness,\u201d he explained. \u201cI am\nliable to these sudden nervous attacks.\u201d\n\u201cShall I send you home in my trap?\u201d asked old\nCunningham. \u201cWell, since I am here, there is one point on\nwhich I should like to feel sure. We can very eas-\nily verify it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it seems to me that it is just possible that\nthe arrival of this poor fellow William was not be-\nfore, but after, the entrance of the burglary into the\n344\nThe Reigate Puzzle\nhouse. You appear to take it for granted that, al-\nthough the door was forced, the robber never got\nin.\u201d\n\u201cI fancy that is quite obvious,\u201d said Mr. Cun-\nningham, gravely. \u201cWhy, my son Alec had not yet\ngone to bed, and he would certainly have heard\nany one moving about.\u201d\n\u201cWhere was he sitting?\u201d\n\u201cI was smoking in my dressing-room.\u201d\n\u201cWhich window is that?\u201d\n\u201cThe last on the left next my father\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cBoth of your lamps were lit, of course?\u201d\n\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d\n\u201cThere are some very singular points here,\u201d\nsaid Holmes, smiling."

Wouldn\u2019t we have found the place\ndisarranged, and missed the things which he had\ntaken?\u201d\n\u201cIt depends on what the things were,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cYou must remember that we are dealing\nwith a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow, and\nwho appears to work on lines of his own. Look,\nfor example, at the queer lot of things which he\ntook from Acton\u2019s\u2014what was it?\u2014a ball of string,\na letter-weight, and I don\u2019t know what other odds\nand ends.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\nwe\nare\nquite\nin\nyour\nhands,\nMr.\nHolmes,\u201d said old Cunningham. \u201cAnything which\nyou or the Inspector may suggest will most cer-\ntainly be done.\u201d\n\u201cIn the \ufb01rst place,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI should\nlike you to offer a reward\u2014coming from yourself,\nfor the of\ufb01cials may take a little time before they\nwould agree upon the sum, and these things can-\nnot be done too promptly.

It was at a quarter to twelve,\nas a matter of fact.\u201d\nI was pained at the mistake, for I knew how\nkeenly Holmes would feel any slip of the kind. It\nwas his specialty to be accurate as to fact, but his\nrecent illness had shaken him, and this one little\nincident was enough to show me that he was still\nfar from being himself. He was obviously embar-\nrassed for an instant, while the Inspector raised\nhis eyebrows, and Alec Cunningham burst into a\nlaugh. The old gentleman corrected the mistake,\nhowever, and handed the paper back to Holmes. \u201cGet it printed as soon as possible,\u201d he said; \u201cI\nthink your idea is an excellent one.\u201d\nHolmes put the slip of paper carefully away\ninto his pocket-book. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said he, \u201cit really would be a good\nthing that we should all go over the house together\nand make certain that this rather erratic burglar\ndid not, after all, carry anything away with him.\u201d\nBefore entering, Holmes made an examination\nof the door which had been forced."

As we moved\nacross it in the direction of the window, Holmes\nfell back until he and I were the last of the group. Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges\nand a carafe of water.

Never certainly have I seen a plainer confes-\nsion of guilt upon human countenances. The older\nman seemed numbed and dazed with a heavy,\nsullen expression upon his strongly-marked face. The son, on the other hand, had dropped all that\njaunty, dashing style which had characterized him,\nand the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed\nin his dark eyes and distorted his handsome fea-\ntures. The Inspector said nothing, but, stepping to\nthe door, he blew his whistle. Two of his consta-\nbles came at the call. \u201cI have no alternative, Mr. Cunningham,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cI trust that this may all prove to be an absurd\nmistake, but you can see that\u2014Ah, would you?

I\u2019ll make the\nwhole matter clear to you presently. I think,\nColonel, that you and Watson might return now,\nand I will be with you again in an hour at the fur-\nthest. The Inspector and I must have a word with\nthe prisoners, but you will certainly see me back at\nluncheon time.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for\nabout one o\u2019clock he rejoined us in the Colonel\u2019s\nsmoking-room. He was accompanied by a little el-\nderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the\nMr. Acton whose house had been the scene of the\noriginal burglary. \u201cI wished Mr. Acton to be present while I\ndemonstrated this small matter to you,\u201d said\nHolmes, \u201cfor it is natural that he should take a\nkeen interest in the details. I am afraid, my dear\nColonel, that you must regret the hour that you\ntook in such a stormy petrel as I am.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d answered the Colonel,\nwarmly, \u201cI consider it the greatest privilege to have\nbeen permitted to study your methods of working.

The point is a sim-\nple one, but the Inspector had overlooked it be-\ncause he had started with the supposition that\nthese county magnates had had nothing to do with\nthe matter. Now, I make a point of never having\nany prejudices, and of following docilely wherever\nfact may lead me, and so, in the very \ufb01rst stage of\nthe investigation, I found myself looking a little\naskance at the part which had been played by Mr.\nAlec Cunningham. \u201cAnd now I made a very careful examination of\nthe corner of paper which the Inspector had sub-\nmitted to us. It was at once clear to me that it\nformed part of a very remarkable document. Here\nit is. Do you not now observed something very\nsuggestive about it?\u201d\n\u201cIt has a very irregular look,\u201d said the Colonel. \u201cMy dear sir,\u201d cried Holmes, \u201cthere cannot be\nthe least doubt in the world that it has been writ-\nten by two persons doing alternate words. When\nI draw your attention to the strong t\u2019s of \u2018at\u2019 and\n\u2018to\u2019, and ask you to compare them with the weak\nones of \u2018quarter\u2019 and \u2018twelve,\u2019 you will instantly\nrecognize the fact. A very brief analysis of these\nfour words would enable you to say with the ut-\nmost con\ufb01dence that the \u2018learn\u2019 and the \u2018maybe\u2019\nare written in the stronger hand, and the \u2018what\u2019 in\nthe weaker.\u201d\n\u201cBy Jove, it\u2019s as clear as day!\u201d cried the Colonel. \u201cWhy on earth should two men write a letter in\nsuch a fashion?\u201d\n\u201cObviously the business was a bad one, and\none of the men who distrusted the other was deter-\nmined that, whatever was done, each should have\nan equal hand in it. Now, of the two men, it is\nclear that the one who wrote the \u2018at\u2019 and \u2018to\u2019 was\nthe ringleader.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you get at that?\u201d\n\u201cWe might deduce it from the mere character\nof the one hand as compared with the other. But\nwe have more assured reasons than that for sup-\nposing it. If you examine this scrap with attention\nyou will come to the conclusion that the man with\nthe stronger hand wrote all his words \ufb01rst, leaving\nblanks for the other to \ufb01ll up. These blanks were\n347\nThe Reigate Puzzle\nnot always suf\ufb01cient, and you can see that the sec-\nond man had a squeeze to \ufb01t his \u2018quarter\u2019 in be-\ntween the \u2018at\u2019 and the \u2018to,\u2019 showing that the latter\nwere already written.

In this case, looking at the bold,\nstrong hand of the one, and the rather broken-\nbacked appearance of the other, which still retains\nits legibility although the t\u2019s have begun to lose\ntheir crossing, we can say that the one was a young\nman and the other was advanced in years without\nbeing positively decrepit.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d cried Mr. Acton again. \u201cThere is a further point, however, which is\nsubtler and of greater interest. There is something\nin common between these hands. They belong to\nmen who are blood-relatives. It may be most ob-\nvious to you in the Greek e\u2019s, but to me there are\nmany small points which indicate the same thing. I have no doubt at all that a family mannerism\ncan be traced in these two specimens of writing. I am only, of course, giving you the leading results\nnow of my examination of the paper. There were\ntwenty-three other deductions which would be of\nmore interest to experts than to you. They all tend\nto deepen the impression upon my mind that the\nCunninghams, father and son, had written this let-\nter. \u201cHaving got so far, my next step was, of course,\nto examine into the details of the crime, and to\nsee how far they would help us. I went up to the\nhouse with the Inspector, and saw all that was to\nbe seen. The wound upon the dead man was, as\nI was able to determine with absolute con\ufb01dence,\n\ufb01red from a revolver at the distance of something\nover four yards. There was no powder-blackening\non the clothes. Evidently, therefore, Alec Cunning-\nham had lied when he said that the two men were\nstruggling when the shot was \ufb01red. Again, both\nfather and son agreed as to the place where the\nman escaped into the road. At that point, how-\never, as it happens, there is a broadish ditch, moist\nat the bottom. As there were no indications of\nbootmarks about this ditch, I was absolutely sure\nnot only that the Cunninghams had again lied, but\nthat there had never been any unknown man upon\nthe scene at all. \u201cAnd now I have to consider the motive of this\nsingular crime. To get at this, I endeavored \ufb01rst of\nall to solve the reason of the original burglary at\nMr. Acton\u2019s. I understood, from something which\nthe Colonel told us, that a lawsuit had been go-\ning on between you, Mr. Acton, and the Cunning-\nhams. Of course, it instantly occurred to me that\nthey had broken into your library with the inten-\ntion of getting at some document which might be\nof importance in the case.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely so,\u201d said Mr. Acton. \u201cThere can be\nno possible doubt as to their intentions. I have the\nclearest claim upon half of their present estate, and\nif they could have found a single paper\u2014which,\nfortunately, was in the strong-box of my solici-\ntors\u2014they would undoubtedly have crippled our\ncase.\u201d\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said Holmes, smiling."

Having found\nnothing they tried to divert suspicion by making\nit appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which\nend they carried off whatever they could lay their\nhands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was\nmuch that was still obscure. What I wanted above\nall was to get the missing part of that note. I was\ncertain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man\u2019s\nhand, and almost certain that he must have thrust\nit into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where\nelse could he have put it? The only question was\nwhether it was still there. It was worth an effort to\n\ufb01nd out, and for that object we all went up to the\nhouse. \u201cThe Cunninghams joined us, as you doubt-\nless remember, outside the kitchen door. It was,\nof course, of the very \ufb01rst importance that they\nshould not be reminded of the existence of this\npaper, otherwise they would naturally destroy it\nwithout delay. The Inspector was about to tell\nthem the importance which we attached to it\nwhen, by the luckiest chance in the world, I tum-\nbled down in a sort of \ufb01t and so changed the con-\nversation.\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried the Colonel, laughing,\n\u201cdo you mean to say all our sympathy was wasted\nand your \ufb01t an imposture?\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking professionally,\nit was admirably\ndone,\u201d cried I, looking in amazement at this man\nwho was forever confounding me with some new\nphase of his astuteness. 348\n\u201cIt is an art which is often useful,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen I recovered I managed, by a device which\nhad perhaps some little merit of ingenuity, to get\nold Cunningham to write the word \u2018twelve,\u2019 so\nthat I might compare it with the \u2018twelve\u2019 upon the\npaper.\u201d\n\u201cOh, what an ass I have been!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cI could see that you were commiserating me\nover my weakness,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cI\nwas sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain which\nI know that you felt. We then went upstairs to-\ngether, and having entered the room and seen the\ndressing-gown hanging up behind the door, I con-\ntrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their at-\ntention for the moment, and slipped back to ex-\namine the pockets. I had hardly got the paper,\nhowever\u2014which was, as I had expected, in one of\nthem\u2014when the two Cunninghams were on me,\nand would, I verily believe, have murdered me\nthen and there but for your prompt and friendly\naid. As it is, I feel that young man\u2019s grip on my\nthroat now, and the father has twisted my wrist\nround in the effort to get the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you see,\nand the sudden change from absolute security to\ncomplete despair made them perfectly desperate. \u201cI had a little talk with old Cunningham af-\nterwards as to the motive of the crime."

When Cunningham saw that the case against him\nwas so strong he lost all heart and made a clean\nbreast of everything. It seems that William had se-\ncretly followed his two masters on the night when\nthey made their raid upon Mr. Acton\u2019s, and having\nthus got them into his power, proceeded, under\nthreats of exposure, to levy black-mail upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a dangerous man to play\ngames of that sort with. It was a stroke of posi-\ntive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare\nwhich was convulsing the country side an oppor-\ntunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom\nhe feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and\nhad they only got the whole of the note and paid\na little more attention to detail in the accessories,\nit is very possible that suspicion might never have\nbeen aroused.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the note?\u201d I asked. Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper\nbefore us.

But say nothing to\nanyone upon the matter\n\u201cIt is very much the sort of thing that I ex-\npected,\u201d said he. \u201cOf course, we do not yet know\nwhat the relations may have been between Alec\nCunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morri-\nson. The results shows that the trap was skillfully\nbaited. I am sure that you cannot fail to be de-\nlighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p\u2019s\nand in the tails of the g\u2019s. The absence of the i-dots\nin the old man\u2019s writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest in the country has\nbeen a distinct success, and I shall certainly return\nmuch invigorated to Baker Street to-morrow.\u201d\nThe Crooked Man\nThe Crooked Man\nO\nne summer night, a few months after\nmy marriage, I was seated by my own\nhearth smoking a last pipe and nodding\nover a novel, for my day\u2019s work had been\nan exhausting one. My wife had already gone up-\nstairs, and the sound of the locking of the hall door\nsome time before told me that the servants had\nalso retired. I had risen from my seat and was\nknocking out the ashes of my pipe when I sud-\ndenly heard the clang of the bell. I looked at the clock. It was a quarter to twelve. This could not be a visitor at so late an hour. A\npatient, evidently, and possibly an all-night sit-\nting. With a wry face I went out into the hall and\nopened the door. To my astonishment it was Sher-\nlock Holmes who stood upon my step."

It is\n353\nThe Crooked Man\nconceivable that you may even have read some ac-\ncount of the matter. It is the supposed murder of\nColonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Alder-\nshot, which I am investigating.\u201d\n\u201cI have heard nothing of it.\u201d\n\u201cIt has not excited much attention yet, except\nlocally. The facts are only two days old. Brie\ufb02y\nthey are these:\n\u201cThe Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of\nthe most famous Irish regiments in the British\narmy. It did wonders both in the Crimea and the\nMutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself\nupon every possible occasion. It was commanded\nup to Monday night by James Barclay, a gallant\nveteran, who started as a full private, was raised\nto commissioned rank for his bravery at the time\nof the Mutiny, and so lived to command the regi-\nment in which he had once carried a musket. \u201cColonel Barclay had married at the time when\nhe was a sergeant, and his wife, whose maiden\nname was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of\na former color-sergeant in the same corps. There\nwas, therefore, as can be imagined, some little so-\ncial friction when the young couple (for they were\nstill young) found themselves in their new sur-\nroundings. They appear, however, to have quickly\nadapted themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always,\nI understand, been as popular with the ladies of\nthe regiment as her husband was with his brother\nof\ufb01cers. I may add that she was a woman of great\nbeauty, and that even now, when she has been mar-\nried for upwards of thirty years, she is still of a\nstriking and queenly appearance. \u201cColonel Barclay\u2019s family life appears to have\nbeen a uniformly happy one. Major Murphy, to\nwhom I owe most of my facts, assures me that he\nhas never heard of any misunderstanding between\nthe pair."

She, on the other hand,\nthough devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively\naffectionate. But they were regarded in the regi-\nment as the very model of a middle-aged couple. There was absolutely nothing in their mutual rela-\ntions to prepare people for the tragedy which was\nto follow. \u201cColonel Barclay himself seems to have had\nsome singular traits in his character. He was a\ndashing, jovial old solder in his usual mood, but\nthere were occasions on which he seemed to show\nhimself capable of considerable violence and vin-\ndictiveness. This side of his nature, however, ap-\npears never to have been turned towards his wife. Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and\nthree out of \ufb01ve of the other of\ufb01cers with whom\nI conversed, was the singular sort of depression\nwhich came upon him at times. As the major ex-\npressed it, the smile had often been struck from\nhis mouth, as if by some invisible hand, when he\nhas been joining the gaieties and chaff of the mess-\ntable. For days on end, when the mood was on\nhim, he has been sunk in the deepest gloom. This\nand a certain tinge of superstition were the only\nunusual traits in his character which his brother\nof\ufb01cers had observed. The latter peculiarity took\nthe form of a dislike to being left alone, especially\nafter dark. This puerile feature in a nature which\nwas conspicuously manly had often given rise to\ncomment and conjecture. \u201cThe \ufb01rst battalion of the Royal Munsters\n(which is the old 117th) has been stationed at\nAldershot for some years. The married of\ufb01cers live\nout of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this\ntime occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a\nmile from the north camp. The house stands in its\nown grounds, but the west side of it is not more\nthan thirty yards from the high-road. A coachman\nand two maids form the staff of servants. These\nwith their master and mistress were the sole occu-\npants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no children,\nnor was it usual for them to have resident visitors. \u201cNow for the events at Lachine between nine\nand ten on the evening of last Monday. \u201cMrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the\nRoman Catholic Church, and had interested her-\nself very much in the establishment of the Guild of\nSt. George, which was formed in connection with\nthe Watt Street Chapel for the purpose of supply-\ning the poor with cast-off clothing. A meeting of\nthe Guild had been held that evening at eight, and\nMrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order\nto be present at it. When leaving the house she\nwas heard by the coachman to make some com-\nmonplace remark to her husband, and to assure\nhim that she would be back before very long."

It lasted forty minutes,\nand at a quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned\nhome, having left Miss Morrison at her door as\nshe passed. \u201cThere is a room which is used as a morning-\nroom at Lachine. This faces the road and opens by\na large glass folding-door on to the lawn. The lawn\nis thirty yards across, and is only divided from the\nhighway by a low wall with an iron rail above it. It\nwas into this room that Mrs. Barclay went upon\n354\nThe Crooked Man\nher return. The blinds were not down, for the\nroom was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs.\nBarclay herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell,\nasking Jane Stewart, the house-maid, to bring her\na cup of tea, which was quite contrary to her usual\nhabits. The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-\nroom, but hearing that his wife had returned he\njoined her in the morning-room. The coachman\nsaw him cross the hall and enter it. He was never\nseen again alive. \u201cThe tea which had been ordered was brought\nup at the end of ten minutes; but the maid, as\nshe approached the door, was surprised to hear\nthe voices of her master and mistress in furious al-\ntercation. She knocked without receiving any an-\nswer, and even turned the handle, but only to \ufb01nd\nthat the door was locked upon the inside. Natu-\nrally enough she ran down to tell the cook, and\nthe two women with the coachman came up into\nthe hall and listened to the dispute which was still\nraging. They all agreed that only two voices were\nto be heard, those of Barclay and of his wife. Bar-\nclay\u2019s remarks were subdued and abrupt, so that\nnone of them were audible to the listeners. The\nlady\u2019s, on the other hand, were most bitter, and\nwhen she raised her voice could be plainly heard. \u2018You coward!\u2019 she repeated over and over again. \u2018What can be done now? What can be done now? Give me back my life. I will never so much as\nbreathe the same air with you again! You coward! You Coward!\u2019 Those were scraps of her conversa-\ntion, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man\u2019s\nvoice, with a crash, and a piercing scream from\nthe woman. Convinced that some tragedy had\noccurred, the coachman rushed to the door and\nstrove to force it, while scream after scream issued\nfrom within. He was unable, however, to make his\nway in, and the maids were too distracted with\nfear to be of any assistance to him. A sudden\nthought struck him, however, and he ran through\nthe hall door and round to the lawn upon which\nthe long French windows open. One side of the\nwindow was open, which I understand was quite\nusual in the summer-time, and he passed without\ndif\ufb01culty into the room."

But here an unexpected\nand singular dif\ufb01culty presented itself. The key\nwas not in the inner side of the door, nor could\nhe \ufb01nd it anywhere in the room. He went out\nagain, therefore, through the window, and having\nobtained the help of a policeman and of a med-\nical man, he returned. The lady, against whom\nnaturally the strongest suspicion rested, was re-\nmoved to her room, still in a state of insensibility. The Colonel\u2019s body was then placed upon the sofa,\nand a careful examination made of the scene of the\ntragedy. \u201cThe injury from which the unfortunate vet-\neran was suffering was found to be a jagged cut\nsome two inches long at the back part of his head,\nwhich had evidently been caused by a violent\nblow from a blunt weapon. Nor was it dif\ufb01cult\nto guess what that weapon may have been. Upon\nthe \ufb02oor, close to the body, was lying a singular\nclub of hard carved wood with a bone handle. The\nColonel possessed a varied collection of weapons\nbrought from the different countries in which he\nhad fought, and it is conjectured by the police that\nhis club was among his trophies. The servants\ndeny having seen it before, but among the numer-\nous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may\nhave been overlooked. Nothing else of importance\nwas discovered in the room by the police, save the\ninexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay\u2019s\nperson nor upon that of the victim nor in any part\nof the room was the missing key to be found. The\ndoor had eventually to be opened by a locksmith\nfrom Aldershot. \u201cThat was the state of things, Watson, when\nupon the Tuesday morning I, at the request of Ma-\njor Murphy, went down to Aldershot to supple-\nment the efforts of the police. I think that you will\nacknowledge that the problem was already one of\ninterest, but my observations soon made me real-\nize that it was in truth much more extraordinary\nthan would at \ufb01rst sight appear. \u201cBefore examining the room I cross-questioned\nthe servants, but only succeeded in eliciting the\nfacts which I have already stated. One other detail\nof interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the\nhousemaid. You will remember that on hearing\nthe sound of the quarrel she descended and re-\nturned with the other servants. On that \ufb01rst occa-\nsion, when she was alone, she says that the voices\nof her master and mistress were sunk so low that\nshe could hear hardly anything, and judged by\ntheir tones rather than their words that they had\nfallen out."

The Colonel\u2019s name, you remem-\nber, was James. 355\nThe Crooked Man\n\u201cThere was one thing in the case which had\nmade the deepest impression both upon the ser-\nvants and the police. This was the contortion of\nthe Colonel\u2019s face. It had set, according to their\naccount, into the most dreadful expression of fear\nand horror which a human countenance is capa-\nble of assuming. More than one person fainted at\nthe mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect. It\nwas quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and\nthat it had caused him the utmost horror. This, of\ncourse, \ufb01tted in well enough with the police the-\nory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making\na murderous attack upon him. Nor was the fact of\nthe wound being on the back of his head a fatal\nobjection to this, as he might have turned to avoid\nthe blow. No information could be got from the\nlady herself, who was temporarily insane from an\nacute attack of brain-fever. \u201cFrom the police I learned that Miss Morri-\nson, who you remember went out that evening\nwith Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge\nof what it was which had caused the ill-humor in\nwhich her companion had returned. \u201cHaving\ngathered\nthese\nfacts,\nWatson,\nI\nsmoked several pipes over them, trying to sepa-\nrate those which were crucial from others which\nwere merely incidental. There could be no ques-\ntion that the most distinctive and suggestive point\nin the case was the singular disappearance of the\ndoor-key. A most careful search had failed to dis-\ncover it in the room. Therefore it must have been\ntaken from it. But neither the Colonel nor the\nColonel\u2019s wife could have taken it. That was per-\nfectly clear. Therefore a third person must have\nentered the room. And that third person could\nonly have come in through the window. It seemed\nto me that a careful examination of the room and\nthe lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this\nmysterious individual. You know my methods,\nWatson. There was not one of them which I did\nnot apply to the inquiry. And it ended by my dis-\ncovering traces, but very different ones from those\nwhich I had expected. There had been a man in the\nroom, and he had crossed the lawn coming from\nthe road. I was able to obtain \ufb01ve very clear im-\npressions of his foot-marks: one in the roadway\nitself, at the point where he had climbed the low\nwall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones\nupon the stained boards near the window where\nhe had entered. He had apparently rushed across\nthe lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper than\nhis heels. But it was not the man who surprised\nme."

The animal has been moving, and we have\nthe length of its stride. In each case it is only about\nthree inches. You have an indication, you see, of a\nlong body with very short legs attached to it. It\nhas not been considerate enough to leave any of\nits hair behind it. But its general shape must be\nwhat I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain,\nand it is carnivorous.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you deduce that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it ran up the curtain.

But we have\nlearned a good deal, you perceive. We know that\na man stood in the road looking at the quarrel be-\ntween the Barclays\u2014the blinds were up and the\nroom lighted. We know, also, that he ran across the\nlawn, entered the room, accompanied by a strange\nanimal, and that he either struck the Colonel or,\nas is equally possible, that the Colonel fell down\nfrom sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his\nhead on the corner of the fender.

But really, Watson, I am keeping you\nup, and I might just as well tell you all this on our\nway to Aldershot to-morrow.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, you have gone rather too far to\nstop.\u201d\n\u201cIt is quite certain that when Mrs. Barclay left\nthe house at half-past seven she was on good terms\nwith her husband. She was never, as I think I\nhave said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she was\nheard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel\nin a friendly fashion. Now, it was equally certain\nthat, immediately on her return, she had gone to\nthe room in which she was least likely to see her\nhusband, had \ufb02own to tea as an agitated woman\nwill, and \ufb01nally, on his coming in to her, had bro-\nken into violent recriminations. Therefore some-\nthing had occurred between seven-thirty and nine\no\u2019clock which had completely altered her feelings\ntowards him. But Miss Morrison had been with\nher during the whole of that hour and a half. It\nwas absolutely certain, therefore, in spite of her\ndenial, that she must know something of the mat-\nter. \u201cMy \ufb01rst conjecture was, that possibly there\nhad been some passages between this young lady\nand the old soldier, which the former had now\nconfessed to the wife. That would account for\nthe angry return, and also for the girl\u2019s denial\nthat anything had occurred. Nor would it be en-\ntirely incompatible with most of the words over-\nhead. But there was the reference to David, and\nthere was the known affection of the Colonel for\nhis wife, to weigh against it, to say nothing of the\ntragic intrusion of this other man, which might,\nof course, be entirely disconnected with what had\ngone before. It was not easy to pick one\u2019s steps,\nbut, on the whole, I was inclined to dismiss the\nidea that there had been anything between the\nColonel and Miss Morrison, but more than ever\nconvinced that the young lady held the clue as to\nwhat it was which had turned Mrs. Barclay to ha-\ntred of her husband. I took the obvious course,\ntherefore, of calling upon Miss M., of explaining\nto her that I was perfectly certain that she held the\nfacts in her possession, and of assuring her that\nher friend, Mrs. Barclay, might \ufb01nd herself in the\ndock upon a capital charge unless the matter were\ncleared up. \u201cMiss Morrison is a little ethereal slip of a girl,\nwith timid eyes and blond hair, but I found her\nby no means wanting in shrewdness and common-\nsense. She sat thinking for some time after I had\nspoken, and then, turning to me with a brisk air of\nresolution, she broke into a remarkable statement\nwhich I will condense for your bene\ufb01t. \u201c \u2018I promised my friend that I would say noth-\ning of the matter, and a promise is a promise,\u2019\nsaid she; \u2018but if I can really help her when so\nserious a charge is laid against her, and when\nher own mouth, poor darling, is closed by illness,\nthen I think I am absolved from my promise."

On our way\nwe had to pass through Hudson Street, which is a\nvery quiet thoroughfare. There is only one lamp in\nit, upon the left-hand side, and as we approached\nthis lamp I saw a man coming towards us with\nis back very bent, and something like a box slung\nover one of his shoulders. He appeared to be de-\nformed, for he carried his head low and walked\nwith his knees bent. We were passing him when\nhe raised his face to look at us in the circle of light\nthrown by the lamp, and as he did so he stopped\nand screamed out in a dreadful voice, \u201cMy God,\nit\u2019s Nancy!\u201d Mrs. Barclay turned as white as death,\nand would have fallen down had the dreadful-\nlooking creature not caught hold of her. I was go-\ning to call for the police, but she, to my surprise,\nspoke quite civilly to the fellow. \u201c \u2018 \u201cI thought you had been dead this thirty\nyears, Henry,\u201d said she, in a shaking voice. \u201c \u2018 \u201cSo I have,\u201d said he, and it was awful to hear\nthe tones that he said it in. He had a very dark,\nfearsome face, and a gleam in his eyes that comes\nback to me in my dreams. His hair and whiskers\nwere shot with gray, and his face was all crinkled\nand puckered like a withered apple. \u201c \u2018 \u201cJust walk on a little way, dear,\u201d said Mrs.\nBarclay; \u201cI want to have a word with this man. There is nothing to be afraid of.\u201d She tried to speak\nboldly, but she was still deadly pale and could\nhardly get her words out for the trembling of her\nlips. \u201c \u2018I did as she asked me, and they talked to-\ngether for a few minutes. Then she came down\nthe street with her eyes blazing, and I saw the crip-\npled wretch standing by the lamp-post and shak-\ning his clenched \ufb01sts in the air as if he were made\n357\nThe Crooked Man\nwith rage. She never said a word until we were at\nthe door here, when she took me by the hand and\nbegged me to tell no one what had happened. \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt\u2019s an old acquaintance of mine who has\ncome down in the world,\u201d said she. When I\npromised her I would say nothing she kissed me,\nand I have never seen her since. I have told you\nnow the whole truth, and if I withheld it from the\npolice it is because I did not realize then the danger\nin which my dear friend stood. I know that it can\nonly be to her advantage that everything should\nbe known.\u2019\n\u201cThere was her statement, Watson, and to me,\nas you can imagine, it was like a light on a dark\nnight."

My next step obviously was to\n\ufb01nd the man who had produced such a remark-\nable impression upon Mrs. Barclay. If he were still\nin Aldershot it should not be a very dif\ufb01cult mat-\nter. There are not such a very great number of\ncivilians, and a deformed man was sure to have\nattracted attention. I spent a day in the search, and\nby evening\u2014this very evening, Watson\u2014I had run\nhim down. The man\u2019s name is Henry Wood, and\nhe lives in lodgings in this same street in which\nthe ladies met him. He has only been \ufb01ve days in\nthe place. In the character of a registration-agent\nI had a most interesting gossip with his landlady. The man is by trade a conjurer and performer, go-\ning round the canteens after nightfall, and giving a\nlittle entertainment at each. He carries some crea-\nture about with him in that box; about which the\nlandlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation,\nfor she had never seen an animal like it. He uses\nit in some of his tricks according to her account. So much the woman was able to tell me, and also\nthat it was a wonder the man lived, seeing how\ntwisted he was, and that he spoke in a strange\ntongue sometimes, and that for the last two nights\nshe had heard him groaning and weeping in his\nbedroom. He was all right, as far as money went,\nbut in his deposit he had given her what looked\nlike a bad \ufb02orin. She showed it to me, Watson,\nand it was an Indian rupee. \u201cSo now, my dear fellow, you see exactly how\nwe stand and why it is I want you. It is perfectly\nplain that after the ladies parted from this man he\nfollowed them at a distance, that he saw the quar-\nrel between husband and wife through the win-\ndow, that he rushed in, and that the creature which\nhe carried in his box got loose. That is all very cer-\ntain. But he is the only person in this world who\ncan tell us exactly what happened in that room.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you intend to ask him?\u201d\n\u201cMost certainly\u2014but in the presence of a wit-\nness.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I am the witness?\u201d\n\u201cIf you will be so good. If he can clear the mat-\nter up, well and good. If he refuses, we have no\nalternative but to apply for a warrant.\u201d\n\u201cBut how do you know he\u2019ll be there when we\nreturn?\u201d\n\u201cYou may be sure that I took some precau-\ntions. I have one of my Baker Street boys mounting\nguard over him who would stick to him like a burr,\ngo where he might. We shall \ufb01nd him in Hudson\nStreet to-morrow, Watson, and meanwhile I should\nbe the criminal myself if I kept you out of bed any\nlonger.\u201d\nIt was midday when we found ourselves at the\nscene of the tragedy, and, under my companion\u2019s\nguidance, we made our way at once to Hudson\nStreet."

This is the\nhouse.\u201d He sent in his card with a message that he\nhad come on important business, and a moment\nlater we were face to face with the man whom we\nhad come to see. In spite of the warm weather he\nwas crouching over a \ufb01re, and the little room was\nlike an oven. The man sat all twisted and hud-\ndled in his chair in a way which gave an indescrib-\nably impression of deformity; but the face which\nhe turned towards us, though worn and swarthy,\nmust at some time have been remarkable for its\nbeauty. He looked suspiciously at us now out of\nyellow-shot, bilious eyes, and, without speaking or\nrising, he waved towards two chairs. \u201cMr. Henry Wood, late of India, I believe,\u201d said\nHolmes, affably. \u201cI\u2019ve come over this little matter\nof Colonel Barclay\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I know about that?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to ascertain.

But,\nmind you this, that if I had knocked his brains\nout, as it was in my heart to do, he would have\nhad no more than his due from my hands. If his\nown guilty conscience had not struck him down it\nis likely enough that I might have had his blood\nupon my soul. You want me to tell the story. Well,\nI don\u2019t know why I shouldn\u2019t, for there\u2019s no cause\nfor me to be ashamed of it. \u201cIt was in this way, sir.

Barclay, who died the other day, was sergeant in\nthe same company as myself, and the belle of the\nregiment, ay, and the \ufb01nest girl that ever had the\nbreath of life between her lips, was Nancy Devoy,\nthe daughter of the color-sergeant. There were two\nmen that loved her, and one that she loved, and\nyou\u2019ll smile when you look at this poor thing hud-\ndled before the \ufb01re, and hear me say that it was\nfor my good looks that she loved me. \u201cWell, though I had her heart, her father was\nset upon her marrying Barclay. I was a harum-\nscarum, reckless lad, and he had had an educa-\ntion, and was already marked for the sword-belt. But the girl held true to me, and it seemed that I\nwould have had her when the Mutiny broke out,\nand all hell was loose in the country. \u201cWe were shut up in Bhurtee, the regiment of\nus with half a battery of artillery, a company of\nSikhs, and a lot of civilians and women-folk. There\nwere ten thousand rebels round us, and they were\nas keen as a set of terriers round a rat-cage. About\nthe second week of it our water gave out, and it\nwas a question whether we could communicate\nwith General Neill\u2019s column, which was moving\nup country. It was our only chance, for we could\nnot hope to \ufb01ght our way out with all the women\nand children, so I volunteered to go out and to\nwarn General Neill of our danger. My offer was\naccepted, and I talked it over with Sergeant Bar-\nclay, who was supposed to know the ground better\nthan any other man, and who drew up a route by\nwhich I might get through the rebel lines. At ten\no\u2019clock the same night I started off upon my jour-\nney. There were a thousand lives to save, but it was\nof only one that I was thinking when I dropped\nover the wall that night. \u201cMy way ran down a dried-up watercourse,\nwhich we hoped would screen me from the en-\nemy\u2019s sentries; but as I crept round the corner of it\nI walked right into six of them, who were crouch-\ning down in the dark waiting for me. In an instant\nI was stunned with a blow and bound hand and\nfoot. But the real blow was to my heart and not to\nmy head, for as I came to and listened to as much\nas I could understand of their talk, I heard enough\nto tell me that my comrade, the very man who had\narranged the way that I was to take, had betrayed\nme by means of a native servant into the hands of\nthe enemy. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no need for me to dwell on that\npart of it. You know now what James Barclay was\ncapable of. Bhurtee was relieved by Neill next day,\nbut the rebels took me away with them in their re-\ntreat, and it was many a long year before ever I\nsaw a white face again."

Some of them that \ufb02ed into Nepal took\nme with them, and then afterwards I was up past\nDarjeeling. The hill-folk up there murdered the\nrebels who had me, and I became their slave for a\ntime until I escaped; but instead of going south I\nhad to go north, until I found myself among the\nAfghans. There I wandered about for many a year,\nand at last came back to the Punjaub, where I lived\nmostly among the natives and picked up a living\nby the conjuring tricks that I had learned. What\nuse was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back\nto England or to make myself known to my old\ncomrades? Even my wish for revenge would not\nmake me do that. I had rather that Nancy and\nmy old pals should think of Harry Wood as hav-\ning died with a straight back, than see him living\nand crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee. They\nnever doubted that I was dead, and I meant that\nthey never should. I heard that Barclay had mar-\nried Nancy, and that he was rising rapidly in the\nregiment, but even that did not make me speak. 359\n\u201cBut when one gets old one has a longing for\nhome.

Your\nown feelings overcame you, and you ran across the\nlawn and broke in upon them.\u201d\n\u201cI did, sir, and at the sight of me he looked as\nI have never seen a man look before, and over he\nwent with his head on the fender. But he was dead\nbefore he fell. I read death on his face as plain as\nI can read that text over the \ufb01re. The bare sight of\nme was like a bullet through his guilty heart.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\u201cThen Nancy fainted, and I caught up the key\nof the door from her hand, intending to unlock it\nand get help.

On the\nother hand, it has frequently happened that he has\nbeen concerned in some research where the facts\nhave been of the most remarkable and dramatic\ncharacter, but where the share which he has him-\nself taken in determining their causes has been less\npronounced than I, as his biographer, could wish. The small matter which I have chronicled under\nthe heading of \u201cA Study in Scarlet,\u201d and that other\nlater one connected with the loss of the Gloria Scott,\nmay serve as examples of this Scylla and Charyb-\ndis which are forever threatening the historian. It\nmay be that in the business of which I am now\nabout to write the part which my friend played\nis not suf\ufb01ciently accentuated; and yet the whole\ntrain of circumstances is so remarkable that I can-\nnot bring myself to omit it entirely from this series. It had been a close, rainy day in October. Our\nblinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled\nupon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter\nwhich he had received by the morning post. For\nmyself, my term of service in India had trained me\nto stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer\nof 90 was no hardship. But the paper was uninter-\nesting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out\nof town, and I yearned for the glades of the New\nForest or the shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank\naccount had caused me to postpone my holiday,\nand as to my companion, neither the country nor\nthe sea presented the slightest attraction to him. He loved to lie in the very centre of \ufb01ve millions of\npeople, with his \ufb01laments stretching out and run-\nning through them, responsive to every little ru-\nmor or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation\nof Nature found no place among his many gifts,\nand his only change was when he turned his mind\nfrom the evil-doer of the town to track down his\nbrother of the country. Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for con-\nversation, I had tossed aside the barren paper, and\nleaning back in my chair, I fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion\u2019s voice broke in upon my\nthoughts. \u201cYou are right, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt does seem\na very preposterous way of settling a dispute.\u201d\n\u201cMost preposterous!\u201d I exclaimed, and then,\nsuddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost\nthought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared\nat him in blank amazement. \u201cWhat is this, Holmes?\u201d I cried. \u201cThis is be-\nyond anything which I could have imagined.\u201d\nHe laughed heartily at my perplexity. \u201cYou remember,\u201d said he, \u201cthat some little time\nago, when I read you the passage in one of Poe\u2019s\nsketches, in which a close reasoner follows the un-\nspoken thought of his companion, you were in-\nclined to treat the matter as a mere tour de force of\nthe author."

Then your eyes ceased\nto pucker, but you continued to look across, and\nyour face was thoughtful. You were recalling the\nincidents of Beecher\u2019s career. I was well aware that\nyou could not do this without thinking of the mis-\nsion which he undertook on behalf of the North\nat the time of the Civil War, for I remember you\nexpressing your passionate indignation at the way\nin which he was received by the more turbulent\nof our people. You felt so strongly about it that\nI knew you could not think of Beecher without\nthinking of that also. When a moment later I saw\nyour eyes wander away from the picture, I sus-\npected that your mind had now turned to the Civil\nWar, and when I observed that your lips set, your\neyes sparkled, and your hands clinched, I was pos-\nitive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry\nwhich was shown by both sides in that desperate\nstruggle."

Your hand stole towards your own old wound, and\na smile quivered on your lips, which showed me\nthat the ridiculous side of this method of settling\ninternational questions had forced itself upon your\nmind. At this point I agreed with you that it was\npreposterous, and was glad to \ufb01nd that all my de-\nductions had been correct.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d said I. \u201cAnd now that you have\nexplained it, I confess that I am as amazed as be-\nfore.\u201d\n\u201cIt was very super\ufb01cial, my dear Watson, I as-\nsure you. I should not have intruded it upon your\nattention had you not shown some incredulity the\nother day. But the evening has brought a breeze\nwith it. What do you say to a ramble through Lon-\ndon?\u201d\nI was weary of our little sitting-room and\ngladly acquiesced. For three hours we strolled\nabout together, watching the ever-changing kalei-\ndoscope of life as it ebbs and \ufb02ows through Fleet\nStreet and the Strand. His characteristic talk, with\nits keen observance of detail and subtle power of\ninference held me amused and enthralled. It was\nten o\u2019clock before we reached Baker Street again. A brougham was waiting at our door. \u201cHum! A doctor\u2019s\u2014general practitioner, I per-\nceive,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNot been long in practice,\nbut has had a good deal to do. Come to consult\nus, I fancy! Lucky we came back!\u201d\nI was suf\ufb01ciently conversant with Holmes\u2019s\nmethods to be able to follow his reasoning, and to\nsee that the nature and state of the various med-\nical instruments in the wicker basket which hung\nin the lamplight inside the brougham had given\nhim the data for his swift deduction. The light in\nour window above showed that this late visit was\nindeed intended for us. With some curiosity as\nto what could have sent a brother medico to us at\nsuch an hour, I followed Holmes into our sanctum. A pale, taper-faced man with sandy whiskers\nrose up from a chair by the \ufb01re as we entered. His\nage may not have been more than three or four and\nthirty, but his haggard expression and unhealthy\nhue told of a life which has sapped his strength\nand robbed him of his youth. His manner was\nnervous and shy, like that of a sensitive gentle-\nman, and the thin white hand which he laid on the\nmantelpiece as he rose was that of an artist rather\nthan of a surgeon. His dress was quiet and som-\nbre\u2014a black frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch\nof color about his necktie. \u201cGood-evening, doctor,\u201d said Holmes, cheerily. \u201cI am glad to see that you have only been waiting\na very few minutes.\u201d\n\u201cYou spoke to my coachman, then?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was the candle on the side-table that\ntold me. Pray resume your seat and let me know\nhow I can serve you.\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Doctor Percy Trevelyan,\u201d said our\nvisitor, \u201cand I live at 403 Brook Street.\u201d\n\u201cAre you not the author of a monograph upon\nobscure nervous lesions?\u201d I asked."

You are\nyourself, I presume, a medical man?\u201d\n\u201cA retired army surgeon.\u201d\n\u201cMy own hobby has always been nervous dis-\nease. I should wish to make it an absolute spe-\ncialty, but, of course, a man must take what he can\nget at \ufb01rst. This, however, is beside the question,\nMr. Sherlock Holmes, and I quite appreciate how\nvaluable your time is. The fact is that a very sin-\ngular train of events has occurred recently at my\nhouse in Brook Street, and to-night they came to\nsuch a head that I felt it was quite impossible for\n364\nThe Resident Patient\nme to wait another hour before asking for your ad-\nvice and assistance.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes sat down and lit his pipe. \u201cYou are very welcome to both,\u201d said he. \u201cPray\nlet me have a detailed account of what the circum-\nstances are which have disturbed you.\u201d\n\u201cOne or two of them are so trivial,\u201d said Dr.\nTrevelyan, \u201cthat really I am almost ashamed to\nmention them. But the matter is so inexplicable,\nand the recent turn which it has taken is so elabo-\nrate, that I shall lay it all before you, and you shall\njudge what is essential and what is not. \u201cI am compelled, to begin with, to say some-\nthing of my own college career. I am a London\nUniversity man, you know, and I am sure that you\nwill not think that I am unduly singing my own\npraises if I say that my student career was consid-\nered by my professors to be a very promising one. After I had graduated I continued to devote myself\nto research, occupying a minor position in King\u2019s\nCollege Hospital, and I was fortunate enough to\nexcite considerable interest by my research into\nthe pathology of catalepsy, and \ufb01nally to win the\nBruce Pinkerton prize and medal by the mono-\ngraph on nervous lesions to which your friend has\njust alluded. I should not go too far if I were to say\nthat there was a general impression at that time\nthat a distinguished career lay before me. \u201cBut the one great stumbling-block lay in my\nwant of capital. As you will readily understand,\na specialist who aims high is compelled to start\nin one of a dozen streets in the Cavendish Square\nquarter, all of which entail enormous rents and\nfurnishing expenses. Besides this preliminary out-\nlay, he must be prepared to keep himself for some\nyears, and to hire a presentable carriage and horse. To do this was quite beyond my power, and I\ncould only hope that by economy I might in ten\nyears\u2019 time save enough to enable me to put up\nmy plate. Suddenly, however, an unexpected inci-\ndent opened up quite a new prospect to me."

You have\nall the cleverness which makes a successful man.

Not drawn towards drink,\neh?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Really, sir!\u2019 I cried. \u201c \u2018Quite right! That\u2019s all right! But I was bound\nto ask. With all these qualities, why are you not in\npractice?\u2019\n\u201cI shrugged my shoulders. \u201c \u2018Come, come!\u2019 said he, in his bustling way. \u2018It\u2019s the old story. More in your brains than in your\npocket, eh? What would you say if I were to start\nyou in Brook Street?\u2019\n\u201cI stared at him in astonishment. \u201c \u2018Oh, it\u2019s for my sake, not for yours,\u2019 he cried. \u2018I\u2019ll be perfectly frank with you, and if it suits you\nit will suit me very well. I have a few thousands to\ninvest, d\u2019ye see, and I think I\u2019ll sink them in you.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018But why?\u2019 I gasped. \u201c \u2018Well, it\u2019s just like any other speculation, and\nsafer than most.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018What am I to do, then?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019ll take the house, furnish it,\npay the maids, and run the whole place. All you\nhave to do is just to wear out your chair in the\nconsulting-room. I\u2019ll let you have pocket-money\nand everything. Then you hand over to me three\nquarters of what you earn, and you keep the other\nquarter for yourself.\u2019\n\u201cThis was the strange proposal, Mr. Holmes,\nwith which the man Blessington approached me. I won\u2019t weary you with the account of how we\nbargained and negotiated. It ended in my mov-\ning into the house next Lady-day, and starting in\npractice on very much the same conditions as he\nhad suggested. He came himself to live with me in\nthe character of a resident patient. His heart was\nweak, it appears, and he needed constant medi-\ncal supervision. He turned the two best rooms of\nthe \ufb01rst \ufb02oor into a sitting-room and bedroom for\nhimself. He was a man of singular habits, shun-\nning company and very seldom going out. His life\nwas irregular, but in one respect he was regularity\nitself. Every evening, at the same hour, he walked\ninto the consulting-room, examined the books, put\ndown \ufb01ve and three-pence for every guinea that I\nhad earned, and carried the rest off to the strong-\nbox in his own room. \u201cI may say with con\ufb01dence that he never had\noccasion to regret his speculation. From the \ufb01rst it\nwas a success."

It only remains\nfor me now to tell you what has occurred to bring\nme her to-night. \u201cSome weeks ago Mr. Blessington came down\nto me in, as it seemed to me, a state of consider-\nable agitation. He spoke of some burglary which,\nhe said, had been committed in the West End, and\nhe appeared, I remember, to be quite unnecessar-\nily excited about it, declaring that a day should\nnot pass before we should add stronger bolts to\nour windows and doors. For a week he contin-\nued to be in a peculiar state of restlessness, peer-\ning continually out of the windows, and ceasing\nto take the short walk which had usually been the\nprelude to his dinner. From his manner it struck\nme that he was in mortal dread of something or\nsomebody, but when I questioned him upon the\npoint he became so offensive that I was compelled\nto drop the subject. Gradually, as time passed, his\nfears appeared to die away, and he had renewed\nhis former habits, when a fresh event reduced him\nto the pitiable state of prostration in which he now\nlies. \u201cWhat happened was this. Two days ago I re-\nceived the letter which I now read to you. Neither\naddress nor date is attached to it. \u201c \u2018A Russian nobleman who is now\nresident in England,\u2019 it runs, \u2018would\nbe glad to avail himself of the profes-\nsional assistance of Dr. Percy Trevelyan. He has been for some years a victim\nto cataleptic attacks, on which, as is\nwell known, Dr. Trevelyan is an author-\nity. He proposes to call at about quar-\nter past six to-morrow evening, if Dr.\nTrevelyan will make it convenient to be\nat home.\u2019\n\u201cThis letter interest me deeply, because the\nchief dif\ufb01culty in the study of catalepsy is the\nrareness of the disease. You may believe, than,\nthat I was in my consulting-room when, at the ap-\npointed hour, the page showed in the patient. He was an elderly man, thin, demure, and\ncommon-place\u2014by no means the conception one\nforms of a Russian nobleman. I was much more\nstruck by the appearance of his companion. This\nwas a tall young man, surprisingly handsome,\nwith a dark, \ufb01erce face, and the limbs and chest\nof a Hercules. He had his hand under the other\u2019s\narm as they entered, and helped him to a chair\nwith a tenderness which one would hardly have\nexpected from his appearance. \u201c \u2018You will excuse my coming in, doctor,\u2019 said\nhe to me, speaking English with a slight lisp. \u2018This\nis my father, and his health is a matter of the most\noverwhelming importance to me.\u2019\n\u201cI was touched by this \ufb01lial anxiety."

If I were to see my father in one of these dreadful\nseizures I am convinced that I should never sur-\nvive it. My own nervous system is an exception-\nally sensitive one. With your permission, I will\nremain in the waiting-room while you go into my\nfather\u2019s case.\u2019\n\u201cTo this, of course, I assented, and the young\nman withdrew. The patient and I then plunged\ninto a discussion of his case, of which I took ex-\nhaustive notes. He was not remarkable for intel-\nligence, and his answers were frequently obscure,\nwhich I attributed to his limited acquaintance with\nour language. Suddenly, however, as I sat writing,\nhe ceased to give any answer at all to my inquiries,\nand on my turning towards him I was shocked to\nsee that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair,\nstaring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face. He was again in the grip of his mysterious malady. \u201cMy \ufb01rst feeling, as I have just said, was one\nof pity and horror. My second, I fear, was rather\none of professional satisfaction. I made notes of\nmy patient\u2019s pulse and temperature, tested the\nrigidity of his muscles, and examined his re\ufb02exes. There was nothing markedly abnormal in any of\nthese conditions, which harmonized with my for-\nmer experiences. I had obtained good results in\nsuch cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, and\nthe present seemed an admirable opportunity of\ntesting its virtues. The bottle was downstairs in\nmy laboratory, so leaving my patient seated in his\nchair, I ran down to get it. There was some little\ndelay in \ufb01nding it\u2014\ufb01ve minutes, let us say\u2014and\nthen I returned. Imagine my amazement to \ufb01nd\nthe room empty and the patient gone. \u201cOf course, my \ufb01rst act was to run into the\nwaiting-room. The son had gone also. The hall\ndoor had been closed, but not shut. My page who\nadmits patients is a new boy and by no means\nquick. He waits downstairs, and runs up to show\npatients out when I ring the consulting-room bell. He had heard nothing, and the affair remained a\ncomplete mystery. Mr. Blessington came in from\n366\nThe Resident Patient\nhis walk shortly afterwards, but I did not say any-\nthing to him upon the subject, for, to tell the truth,\nI have got in the way of late of holding as little\ncommunication with him as possible. \u201cWell, I never thought that I should see any-\nthing more of the Russian and his son, so you can\nimagine my amazement when, at the very same\nhour this evening, they both came marching into\nmy consulting-room, just as they had done before. \u201c \u2018I feel that I owe you a great many apologies\nfor my abrupt departure yesterday, doctor,\u2019 said\nmy patient."

I woke up\nin a strange room, as it seemed to me, and made\nmy way out into the street in a sort of dazed way\nwhen you were absent.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And I,\u2019 said the son, \u2018seeing my father pass\nthe door of the waiting-room, naturally thought\nthat the consultation had come to an end.

It rained hard this afternoon, as\nyou know, and my patients were the only people\nwho called. It must have been the case, then, that\nthe man in the waiting-room had, for some un-\nknown reason, while I was busy with the other, as-\ncended to the room of my resident patient. Noth-\ning has been touched or taken, but there were the\nfootprints to prove that the intrusion was an un-\ndoubted fact. \u201cMr. Blessington seemed more excited over\nthe matter than I should have thought possible,\nthough of course it was enough to disturb any-\nbody\u2019s peace of mind. He actually sat crying in an\narm-chair, and I could hardly get him to speak co-\nherently. It was his suggestion that I should come\nround to you, and of course I at once saw the pro-\npriety of it, for certainly the incident is a very sin-\ngular one, though he appears to completely over-\nrate its importance. If you would only come back\nwith me in my brougham, you would at least be\nable to soothe him, though I can hardly hope that\nyou will be able to explain this remarkable occur-\nrence.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes had listened to this long nar-\nrative with an intentness which showed me that\nhis interest was keenly aroused."

We had crossed Oxford Street and\nwere half way down Harley Street before I could\nget a word from my companion. \u201cSorry to bring you out on such a fool\u2019s errand,\nWatson,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is an interesting case,\ntoo, at the bottom of it.\u201d\n\u201cI can make little of it,\u201d I confessed. \u201cWell, it is quite evident that there are two\nmen\u2014more, perhaps, but at least two\u2014who are\ndetermined for some reason to get at this fellow\nBlessington.

It is inconceivable\nthat this fellow could have made two such vindic-\ntive enemies as these appear to be without know-\ning of it. I hold it, therefore, to be certain that he\ndoes know who these men are, and that for rea-\nsons of his own he suppresses it. It is just possible\nthat to-morrow may \ufb01nd him in a more commu-\nnicative mood.\u201d\n\u201cIs there not one alternative,\u201d I suggested,\n\u201cgrotesquely improbably, no doubt, but still just\nconceivable? Might the whole story of the catalep-\ntic Russian and his son be a concoction of Dr.\nTrevelyan\u2019s, who has, for his own purposes, been\nin Blessington\u2019s rooms?\u201d\nI saw in the gaslight that Holmes wore an\namused smile at this brilliant departure of mine."

This\nyoung man has left prints upon the stair-carpet\nwhich made it quite super\ufb02uous for me to ask to\nsee those which he had made in the room. When\nI tell you that his shoes were square-toed instead\nof being pointed like Blessington\u2019s, and were quite\nan inch and a third longer than the doctor\u2019s, you\nwill acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to\nhis individuality. But we may sleep on it now, for\n368\nThe Resident Patient\nI shall be surprised if we do not hear something\nfurther from Brook Street in the morning.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes\u2019s prophecy was soon ful\ufb01lled,\nand in a dramatic fashion. At half-past seven next\nmorning, in the \ufb01rst glimmer of daylight, I found\nhim standing by my bedside in his dressing-gown. \u201cThere\u2019s a brougham waiting for us, Watson,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, then?\u201d\n\u201cThe Brook Street business.\u201d\n\u201cAny fresh news?\u201d\n\u201cTragic, but ambiguous,\u201d said he, pulling up\nthe blind. \u201cLook at this\u2014a sheet from a note-book,\nwith \u2018For God\u2019s sake come at once\u2014P. T.,\u2019 scrawled\nupon it in pencil. Our friend, the doctor, was hard\nput to it when he wrote this. Come along, my dear\nfellow, for it\u2019s an urgent call.\u201d\nIn a quarter of an hour or so we were back at\nthe physician\u2019s house. He came running out to\nmeet us with a face of horror. \u201cOh, such a business!\u201d he cried, with his hands\nto his temples. \u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\u201cBlessington has committed suicide!\u201d\nHolmes whistled. \u201cYes, he hanged himself during the night.\u201d\nWe had entered, and the doctor had preceded\nus into what was evidently his waiting-room. \u201cI really hardly know what I am doing,\u201d he\ncried. \u201cThe police are already upstairs. It has\nshaken me most dreadfully.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you \ufb01nd it out?\u201d\n\u201cHe has a cup of tea taken in to him early every\nmorning. When the maid entered, about seven,\nthere the unfortunate fellow was hanging in the\nmiddle of the room. He had tied his cord to the\nhook on which the heavy lamp used to hang, and\nhe had jumped off from the top of the very box\nthat he showed us yesterday.\u201d\nHolmes stood for a moment in deep thought. \u201cWith your permission,\u201d said he at last, \u201cI\nshould like to go upstairs and look into the mat-\nter.\u201d\nWe both ascended, followed by the doctor. It was a dreadful sight which met us as we en-\ntered the bedroom door. I have spoken of the im-\npression of \ufb02abbiness which this man Blessington\nconveyed. As he dangled from the hook it was ex-\naggerated and intensi\ufb01ed until he was scarce hu-\nman in his appearance. The neck was drawn out\nlike a plucked chicken\u2019s, making the rest of him\nseem the more obese and unnatural by the con-\ntrast. He was clad only in his long night-dress, and\nhis swollen ankles and ungainly feet protruded\nstarkly from beneath it."

Have\nyou heard of the events which led up to this af-\nfair?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I heard something of them.\u201d\n\u201cHave you formed any opinion?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I can see, the man has been driven\nout of his senses by fright. The bed has been\nwell slept in, you see. There\u2019s his impression deep\nenough. It\u2019s about \ufb01ve in the morning, you know,\nthat suicides are most common. That would be\nabout his time for hanging himself. It seems to\nhave been a very deliberate affair.\u201d\n\u201cI should say that he has been dead about three\nhours, judging by the rigidity of the muscles,\u201d said\nI. \u201cNoticed anything peculiar about the room?\u201d\nasked Holmes. \u201cFound a screw-driver and some screws on the\nwash-hand stand. Seems to have smoked heavily\nduring the night, too. Here are four cigar-ends that\nI picked out of the \ufb01replace.\u201d\n\u201cHum!\u201d said Holmes, \u201chave you got his cigar-\nholder?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I have seen none.\u201d\n\u201cHis cigar-case, then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was in his coat-pocket.\u201d\nHolmes opened it and smelled the single cigar\nwhich it contained. \u201cOh, this is an Havana, and these others are\ncigars of the peculiar sort which are imported by\nthe Dutch from their East Indian colonies. They\nare usually wrapped in straw, you know, and are\nthinner for their length than any other brand.\u201d He\npicked up the four ends and examined them with\nhis pocket-lens. \u201cTwo of these have been smoked from a holder\nand two without,\u201d said he. \u201cTwo have been cut by\na not very sharp knife, and two have had the ends\nbitten off by a set of excellent teeth. This is no sui-\ncide, Mr. Lanner. It is a very deeply planned and\ncold-blooded murder.\u201d\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d cried the inspector. \u201cAnd why?\u201d\n369\nThe Resident Patient\n\u201cWhy should any one murder a man in so\nclumsy a fashion as by hanging him?\u201d\n\u201cThat is what we have to \ufb01nd out.\u201d\n\u201cHow could they get in?\u201d\n\u201cThrough the front door.\u201d\n\u201cIt was barred in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cThen it was barred after them.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cI saw their traces. Excuse me a moment, and I\nmay be able to give you some further information\nabout it.\u201d\nHe went over to the door, and turning the lock\nhe examined it in his methodical way. Then he\ntook out the key, which was on the inside, and in-\nspected that also. The bed, the carpet, the chairs\nthe mantelpiece, the dead body, and the rope were\neach in turn examined, until at last he professed\nhimself satis\ufb01ed, and with my aid and that of the\ninspector cut down the wretched object and laid it\nreverently under a sheet. \u201cHow about this rope?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is cut off this,\u201d said Dr. Trevelyan, drawing a\nlarge coil from under the bed."

I had the advantage\nof learning which was which last night. They as-\ncended, then, to Mr. Blessington\u2019s room, the door\nof which they found to be locked. With the help of\na wire, however, they forced round the key. Even\nwithout the lens you will perceive, by the scratches\non this ward, where the pressure was applied. \u201cOn entering the room their \ufb01rst proceeding\nmust have been to gag Mr. Blessington. He may\nhave been asleep, or he may have been so para-\nlyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out. These walls are thick, and it is conceivable that his\nshriek, if he had time to utter one, was unheard. \u201cHaving secured him, it is evident to me that\na consultation of some sort was held. Probably\nit was something in the nature of a judicial pro-\nceeding. It must have lasted for some time, for\nit was then that these cigars were smoked. The\nolder man sat in that wicker chair; it was he who\nused the cigar-holder. The younger man sat over\nyonder; he knocked his ash off against the chest\nof drawers. The third fellow paced up and down. Blessington, I think, sat upright in the bed, but of\nthat I cannot be absolutely certain. \u201cWell, it ended by their taking Blessington and\nhanging him."

Tobin, the care-taker, was murdered,\nand the thieves got away with seven thousand\npounds. This was in 1875. They were all \ufb01ve ar-\nrested, but the evidence against them was by no\nmeans conclusive. This Blessington or Sutton, who\nwas the worst of the gang, turned informer. On\nhis evidence Cartwright was hanged and the other\nthree got \ufb01fteen years apiece. When they got out\nthe other day, which was some years before their\nfull term, they set themselves, as you perceive, to\nhunt down the traitor and to avenge the death of\ntheir comrade upon him. Twice they tried to get at\nhim and failed; a third time, you see, it came off. Is there anything further which I can explain, Dr.\nTrevelyan?\u201d\n\u201cI think you have made it all remarkable clear,\u201d\nsaid the doctor. \u201cNo doubt the day on which he\nwas perturbed was the day when he had seen of\ntheir release in the newspapers.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so."

His secret was a shameful one, and he\ncould not bring himself to divulge it. However,\nwretch as he was, he was still living under the\nshield of British law, and I have no doubt, Inspec-\ntor, that you will see that, though that shield may\nfail to guard, the sword of justice is still there to\navenge.\u201d\nSuch were the singular circumstances in con-\nnection with the Resident Patient and the Brook\nStreet Doctor. From that night nothing has been\nseen of the three murderers by the police, and\nit is surmised at Scotland Yard that they were\namong the passengers of the ill-fated steamer No-\nrah Creina, which was lost some years ago with all\nhands upon the Portuguese coast, some leagues to\nthe north of Oporto. The proceedings against the\npage broke down for want of evidence, and the\nBrook Street Mystery, as it was called, has never\nuntil now been fully dealt with in any public print. The Greek Interpreter\nThe Greek Interpreter\nD\nuring my long and intimate acquain-\ntance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had\nnever heard him refer to his relations,\nand hardly ever to his own early life. This reticence upon his part had increased the\nsomewhat inhuman effect which he produced\nupon me, until sometimes I found myself regard-\ning him as an isolated phenomenon, a brain with-\nout a heart, as de\ufb01cient in human sympathy as he\nwas pre-eminent in intelligence. His aversion to\nwomen and his disinclination to form new friend-\nships were both typical of his unemotional charac-\nter, but not more so than his complete suppression\nof every reference to his own people. I had come\nto believe that he was an orphan with no relatives\nliving, but one day, to my very great surprise, he\nbegan to talk to me about his brother. It was after tea on a summer evening, and the\nconversation, which had roamed in a desultory,\nspasmodic fashion from golf clubs to the causes\nof the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, came\nround at last to the question of atavism and hered-\nitary aptitudes. The point under discussion was,\nhow far any singular gift in an individual was due\nto his ancestry and how far to his own early train-\ning. \u201cIn your own case,\u201d said I, \u201cfrom all that you\nhave told me, it seems obvious that your faculty of\nobservation and your peculiar facility for deduc-\ntion are due to your own systematic training.\u201d\n\u201cTo some extent,\u201d he answered, thoughtfully. \u201cMy ancestors were country squires, who appear\nto have led much the same life as is natural to their\nclass.

He will not even go out of his way to verify\nhis own solution, and would rather be considered\nwrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again I have taken a problem to him,\nand have received an explanation which has after-\nwards proved to be the correct one. And yet he\nwas absolutely incapable of working out the prac-\ntical points which must be gone into before a case\ncould be laid before a judge or jury.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not his profession, then?\u201d\n\u201cBy no means.

If you would care to\nhear the facts\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Mycroft, I should be delighted.\u201d\n376\nThe Greek Interpreter\nThe brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his\npocket-book, and, ringing the bell, he handed it to\nthe waiter. \u201cI have asked Mr. Melas to step across,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cHe lodges on the \ufb02oor above me, and I have\nsome slight acquaintance with him, which led him\nto come to me in his perplexity. Mr. Melas is a\nGreek by extraction, as I understand, and he is a\nremarkable linguist. He earns his living partly as\ninterpreter in the law courts and partly by acting\nas guide to any wealthy Orientals who may visit\nthe Northumberland Avenue hotels. I think I will\nleave him to tell his very remarkable experience in\nhis own fashion.\u201d\nA few minutes later we were joined by a short,\nstout man whose olive face and coal-black hair\nproclaimed his Southern origin, though his speech\nwas that of an educated Englishman."

I\nam an interpreter, as perhaps my neighbor there\nhas told you. I interpret all languages\u2014or nearly\nall\u2014but as I am a Greek by birth and with a Gre-\ncian name, it is with that particular tongue that I\nam principally associated. For many years I have\nbeen the chief Greek interpreter in London, and\nmy name is very well known in the hotels. It happens not unfrequently that I am sent for\nat strange hours by foreigners who get into dif\ufb01-\nculties, or by travelers who arrive late and wish my\nservices. I was not surprised, therefore, on Mon-\nday night when a Mr. Latimer, a very fashionably\ndressed young man, came up to my rooms and\nasked me to accompany him in a cab which was\nwaiting at the door. A Greek friend had come to\nsee him upon business, he said, and as he could\nspeak nothing but his own tongue, the services of\nan interpreter were indispensable. He gave me to\nunderstand that his house was some little distance\noff, in Kensington, and he seemed to be in a great\nhurry, bustling me rapidly into the cab when we\nhad descended to the street. \u201cI say into the cab, but I soon became doubtful\nas to whether it was not a carriage in which I found\nmyself. It was certainly more roomy than the ordi-\nnary four-wheeled disgrace to London, and the \ufb01t-\ntings, though frayed, were of rich quality. Mr. La-\ntimer seated himself opposite to me and we started\noff through Charing Cross and up the Shaftesbury\nAvenue. We had come out upon Oxford Street and\nI had ventured some remark as to this being a\nroundabout way to Kensington, when my words\nwere arrested by the extraordinary conduct of my\ncompanion. \u201cHe began by drawing a most formidable-\nlooking bludgeon loaded with lead from his\npocket, and switching it backward and forward\nseveral times, as if to test its weight and strength. Then he placed it without a word upon the seat\nbeside him. Having done this, he drew up the\nwindows on each side, and I found to my aston-\nishment that they were covered with paper so as\nto prevent my seeing through them. \u201c \u2018I am sorry to cut off your view, Mr. Melas,\u2019\nsaid he."

It might possibly be inconvenient to me if\nyou could \ufb01nd your way there again.\u2019\n\u201cAs you can imagine, I was utterly taken aback\nby such an address. My companion was a pow-\nerful, broad-shouldered young fellow, and, apart\nfrom the weapon, I should not have had the slight-\nest chance in a struggle with him. \u201c \u2018This is very extraordinary conduct, Mr. La-\ntimer,\u2019 I stammered. \u2018You must be aware that what\nyou are doing is quite illegal.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018It is somewhat of a liberty, no doubt,\u2019 said\nhe, \u2018but we\u2019ll make it up to you. I must warn you,\nhowever, Mr. Melas, that if at any time to-night you\nattempt to raise an alarm or do anything which is\nagainst my interests, you will \ufb01nd it a very serious\nthing. I beg you to remember that no one knows\nwhere you are, and that, whether you are in this\ncarriage or in my house, you are equally in my\npower.\u2019\n\u201cHis words were quiet, but he had a rasping\nway of saying them which was very menacing. I\nsat in silence wondering what on earth could be\nhis reason for kidnapping me in this extraordinary\nfashion. Whatever it might be, it was perfectly\nclear that there was no possible use in my resist-\ning, and that I could only wait to see what might\nbefall. \u201cFor nearly two hours we drove without my\nhaving the least clue as to where we were going. 377\nThe Greek Interpreter\nSometimes the rattle of the stones told of a paved\ncauseway, and at others our smooth, silent course\nsuggested asphalt; but, save by this variation in\nsound, there was nothing at all which could in the\nremotest way help me to form a guess as to where\nwe were. The paper over each window was im-\npenetrable to light, and a blue curtain was drawn\nacross the glass work in front. It was a quarter-\npast seven when we left Pall Mall, and my watch\nshowed me that it was ten minutes to nine when\nwe at last came to a standstill. My companion let\ndown the window, and I caught a glimpse of a\nlow, arched doorway with a lamp burning above\nit. As I was hurried from the carriage it swung\nopen, and I found myself inside the house, with a\nvague impression of a lawn and trees on each side\nof me as I entered. Whether these were private\ngrounds, however, or bona-\ufb01de country was more\nthan I could possibly venture to say. \u201cThere was a colored gas-lamp inside which\nwas turned so low that I could see little save that\nthe hall was of some size and hung with pictures. In the dim light I could make out that the per-\nson who had opened the door was a small, mean-\nlooking, middle-aged man with rounded shoul-\nders."

The\nchamber was certainly large, and the way in which\nmy feet sank into the carpet as I stepped across it\ntold me of its richness. I caught glimpses of vel-\nvet chairs, a high white marble mantel-piece, and\nwhat seemed to be a suit of Japanese armor at one\nside of it. There was a chair just under the lamp,\nand the elderly man motioned that I should sit\nin it. The younger had left us, but he suddenly\nreturned through another door, leading with him\na gentleman clad in some sort of loose dressing-\ngown who moved slowly towards us. As he came\ninto the circle of dim light which enables me to see\nhim more clearly I was thrilled with horror at his\nappearance. He was deadly pale and terribly ema-\nciated, with the protruding, brilliant eyes of a man\nwhose spirit was greater than his strength. But\nwhat shocked me more than any signs of physical\nweakness was that his face was grotesquely criss-\ncrossed with sticking-plaster, and that one large\npad of it was fastened over his mouth. \u201c \u2018Have you the slate, Harold?\u2019 cried the older\nman, as this strange being fell rather than sat down\ninto a chair. \u2018Are his hands loose?

Our conversation ran something like this:\n\u201c \u2018You can do no good by this obstinacy. Who\nare you?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I care not.

Sophy!\u2019 rushed into the woman\u2019s arms. Their\nembrace was but for an instant, however, for the\nyounger man seized the woman and pushed her\nout of the room, while the elder easily overpow-\nered his emaciated victim, and dragged him away\nthrough the other door. For a moment I was left\nalone in the room, and I sprang to my feet with\nsome vague idea that I might in some way get\na clue to what this house was in which I found\nmyself. Fortunately, however, I took no steps, for\nlooking up I saw that the older man was standing\nin the door-way with his eyes \ufb01xed upon me. \u201c \u2018That will do, Mr. Melas,\u2019 said he. \u2018You\nperceive that we have taken you into our con\ufb01-\ndence over some very private business.

Far away stretched a line\nof houses, with a light here and there in the upper\nwindows.

On reaching Scotland Yard, however, it was\nmore than an hour before we could get Inspec-\ntor Gregson and comply with the legal formali-\nties which would enable us to enter the house. It\nwas a quarter to ten before we reached London\nBridge, and half past before the four of us alighted\non the Beckenham platform. A drive of half a mile\nbrought us to The Myrtles\u2014a large, dark house\nstanding back from the road in its own grounds. Here we dismissed our cab, and made our way up\nthe drive together. \u201cThe windows are all dark,\u201d remarked the in-\nspector. \u201cThe house seems deserted.\u201d\n\u201cOur birds are \ufb02own and the nest empty,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d\n\u201cA carriage heavily loaded with luggage has\npassed out during the last hour.\u201d\nThe inspector laughed. \u201cI saw the wheel-tracks\nin the light of the gate-lamp, but where does the\nluggage come in?\u201d\n\u201cYou may have observed the same wheel-tracks\ngoing the other way. But the outward-bound ones\nwere very much deeper\u2014so much so that we can\nsay for a certainty that there was a very consider-\nable weight on the carriage.\u201d\n\u201cYou get a tri\ufb02e beyond me there,\u201d said the in-\nspector, shrugging his shoulder. \u201cIt will not be an\neasy door to force, but we will try if we cannot\nmake some one hear us.\u201d\nHe hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled\nat the bell, but without any success."

The inspec-\ntor had lit his lantern, and by its light we could\nsee the two doors, the curtain, the lamp, and the\nsuit of Japanese mail as he had described them. On\nthe table lay two glasses, and empty brandy-bottle,\nand the remains of a meal. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Holmes, suddenly. We all stood still and listened. A low moan-\ning sound was coming from somewhere over our\nheads. Holmes rushed to the door and out into\nthe hall. The dismal noise came from upstairs. He\ndashed up, the inspector and I at his heels, while\nhis brother Mycroft followed as quickly as his great\nbulk would permit. Three doors faced up upon the second \ufb02oor,\nand it was from the central of these that the sinis-\nter sounds were issuing, sinking sometimes into a\ndull mumble and rising again into a shrill whine. It was locked, but the key had been left on the out-\nside. Holmes \ufb02ung open the door and rushed in,\nbut he was out again in an instant, with his hand\nto his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s charcoal,\u201d he cried. \u201cGive it time. It will\nclear.\u201d\nPeering in, we could see that the only light\nin the room came from a dull blue \ufb02ame which\n\ufb02ickered from a small brass tripod in the centre. It threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the \ufb02oor,\nwhile in the shadows beyond we saw the vague\nloom of two \ufb01gures which crouched against the\nwall. From the open door there reeked a horri-\nble poisonous exhalation which set us gasping and\ncoughing. Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs\nto draw in the fresh air, and then, dashing into\nthe room, he threw up the window and hurled the\nbrazen tripod out into the garden. \u201cWe can enter in a minute,\u201d he gasped, darting\nout again. \u201cWhere is a candle? I doubt if we could\nstrike a match in that atmosphere. Hold the light\nat the door and we shall get them out, Mycroft,\nnow!\u201d\nWith a rush we got to the poisoned men and\ndragged them out into the well-lit hall. Both\nof them were blue-lipped and insensible, with\nswollen, congested faces and protruding eyes. In-\ndeed, so distorted were their features that, save for\nhis black beard and stout \ufb01gure, we might have\nfailed to recognize in one of them the Greek inter-\npreter who had parted from us only a few hours\nbefore at the Diogenes Club."

The other,\nwho was secured in a similar fashion, was a tall\nman in the last stage of emaciation, with several\nstrips of sticking-plaster arranged in a grotesque\npattern over his face. He had ceased to moan as we\nlaid him down, and a glance showed me that for\nhim at least our aid had come too late. Mr. Melas,\nhowever, still lived, and in less than an hour, with\nthe aid of ammonia and brandy I had the satisfac-\ntion of seeing him open his eyes, and of knowing\nthat my hand had drawn him back from that dark\nvalley in which all paths meet. It was a simple story which he had to tell, and\none which did but con\ufb01rm our own deductions. His visitor, on entering his rooms, had drawn\na life-preserver from his sleeve, and had so im-\npressed him with the fear of instant and inevitable\ndeath that he had kidnapped him for the second\ntime. Indeed, it was almost mesmeric, the effect\nwhich this giggling ruf\ufb01an had produced upon the\nunfortunate linguist, for he could not speak of him\nsave with trembling hands and a blanched cheek. He had been taken swiftly to Beckenham, and had\nacted as interpreter in a second interview, even\nmore dramatic than the \ufb01rst, in which the two En-\nglishmen had menaced their prisoner with instant\ndeath if he did not comply with their demands. Fi-\nnally, \ufb01nding him proof against every threat, they\nhad hurled him back into his prison, and after\nreproaching Melas with his treachery, which ap-\npeared from the newspaper advertisement, they\nhad stunned him with a blow from a stick, and\nhe remembered nothing more until he found us\nbending over him. And this was the singular case of the Grecian\nInterpreter, the explanation of which is still in-\nvolved in some mystery. We were able to \ufb01nd\nout, by communicating with the gentleman who\nhad answered the advertisement, that the unfortu-\nnate young lady came of a wealthy Grecian family,\nand that she had been on a visit to some friends\nin England. While there she had met a young man\nnamed Harold Latimer, who had acquired an as-\ncendancy over her and had eventually persuaded\nher to \ufb02y with him. Her friends, shocked at the\nevent, had contented themselves with informing\nher brother at Athens, and had then washed their\nhands of the matter. The brother, on his arrival\nin England, had imprudently placed himself in\nthe power of Latimer and of his associate, whose\nname was Wilson Kemp\u2014a man of the foulest an-\ntecedents. These two, \ufb01nding that through his ig-\nnorance of the language he was helpless in their\nhands, had kept him a prisoner, and had endeav-\nored by cruelty and starvation to make him sign\naway his own and his sister\u2019s property. They had\n382\nkept him in the house without the girl\u2019s knowl-\nedge, and the plaster over the face had been for the\npurpose of making recognition dif\ufb01cult in case she\nshould ever catch a glimpse of him."

The poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner,\nfor there was no one about the house except the\nman who acted as coachman, and his wife, both of\nwhom were tools of the conspirators. Finding that\ntheir secret was out, and that their prisoner was\nnot to be coerced, the two villains with the girl had\n\ufb02ed away at a few hours\u2019 notice from the furnished\nhouse which they had hired, having \ufb01rst, as they\nthought, taken vengeance both upon the man who\nhad de\ufb01ed and the one who had betrayed them. Months afterwards a curious newspaper cut-\nting reached us from Buda-Pesth. It told how two\nEnglishmen who had been traveling with a woman\nhad met with a tragic end. They had each been\nstabbed, it seems, and the Hungarian police were\nof opinion that they had quarreled and had in-\n\ufb02icted mortal injuries upon each other. Holmes,\nhowever, is, I fancy, of a different way of thinking,\nand holds to this day that, if one could \ufb01nd the\nGrecian girl, one might learn how the wrongs of\nherself and her brother came to be avenged. The Naval Treaty\nThe Naval Treaty\nT\nhe July which immediately succeeded\nmy marriage was made memorable by\nthree cases of interest, in which I had the\nprivilege of being associated with Sher-\nlock Holmes and of studying his methods. I \ufb01nd\nthem recorded in my notes under the headings of\n\u201cThe Adventure of the Second Stain,\u201d \u201cThe Ad-\nventure of the Naval Treaty,\u201d and \u201cThe Adventure\nof the Tired Captain.\u201d The \ufb01rst of these, however,\ndeals with interest of such importance and impli-\ncates so many of the \ufb01rst families in the kingdom\nthat for many years it will be impossible to make\nit public. No case, however, in which Holmes was\nengaged has ever illustrated the value of his ana-\nlytical methods so clearly or has impressed those\nwho were associated with him so deeply. I still\nretain an almost verbatim report of the interview\nin which he demonstrated the true facts of the\ncase to Monsieur Dubugue of the Paris police, and\nFritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of\nDantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies\nupon what proved to be side-issues. The new cen-\ntury will have come, however, before the story can\nbe safely told. Meanwhile I pass on to the second\non my list, which promised also at one time to be\nof national importance, and was marked by several\nincidents which give it a quite unique character. During my school-days I had been intimately\nassociated with a lad named Percy Phelps, who\nwas of much the same age as myself, though he\nwas two classes ahead of me. He was a very\nbrilliant boy, and carried away every prize which\nthe school had to offer, \ufb01nished his exploits by\nwinning a scholarship which sent him on to con-\ntinue his triumphant career at Cambridge."

Of\ncourse I must have met him if he had come the\nother way.\u201d\n\u201cYou were satis\ufb01ed that he could not have\nbeen concealed in the room all the time, or in the\ncorridor which you have just described as dimly\nlighted?\u201d\n\u201cIt is absolutely impossible. A rat could not\nconceal himself either in the room or the corridor. There is no cover at all.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. Pray proceed.\u201d\n\u201cThe commissionaire, seeing by my pale face\nthat something was to be feared, had followed me\nupstairs. Now we both rushed along the corridor\nand down the steep steps which led to Charles\nStreet. The door at the bottom was closed, but\nunlocked. We \ufb02ung it open and rushed out. I\ncan distinctly remember that as we did so there\ncame three chimes from a neighboring clock. It\nwas quarter to ten.\u201d\n\u201cThat\nis\nof\nenormous\nimportance,\u201d\nsaid\nHolmes, making a note upon his shirt-cuff. \u201cThe night was very dark, and a thin, warm\nrain was falling. There was no one in Charles\nStreet, but a great traf\ufb01c was going on, as usual,\nin Whitehall, at the extremity. We rushed along\nthe pavement, bare-headed as we were, and at the\nfar corner we found a policeman standing. \u201c \u2018A robbery has been committed,\u2019 I gasped. \u2018A\ndocument of immense value has been stolen from\nthe Foreign Of\ufb01ce. Has any one passed this way?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I have been standing here for a quarter of an\nhour, sir,\u2019 said he; \u2018only one person has passed dur-\ning that time\u2014a woman, tall and elderly, with a\nPaisley shawl.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Ah, that is only my wife,\u2019 cried the commis-\nsionaire; \u2018has no one else passed?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018No one.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Then it must be the other way that the thief\ntook,\u2019 cried the fellow, tugging at my sleeve. \u201cBut I was not satis\ufb01ed, and the attempts\nwhich he made to draw me away increased my\nsuspicions. \u201c \u2018Which way did the woman go?\u2019 I cried. \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t know, sir. I noticed her pass, but I had\nno special reason for watching her. She seemed to\nbe in a hurry.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018How long ago was it?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Oh, not very many minutes.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Within the last \ufb01ve?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Well, it could not be more than \ufb01ve.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You\u2019re only wasting your time, sir, and every\nminute now is of importance,\u2019 cried the commis-\nsionaire; \u2018take my word for it that my old woman\nhas nothing to do with it, and come down to the\nother end of the street. Well, if you won\u2019t, I will.\u2019\nAnd with that he rushed off in the other direction. \u201cBut I was after him in an instant and caught\nhim by the sleeve. \u201c \u2018Where do you live?\u2019 said I. \u201c \u201816 Ivy Lane, Brixton,\u2019 he answered. \u2018But\ndon\u2019t let yourself be drawn away upon a false\nscent, Mr. Phelps."

With the policeman we both hurried down,\nbut only to \ufb01nd the street full of traf\ufb01c, many peo-\nple coming and going, but all only too eager to get\nto a place of safety upon so wet a night. There was\nno lounger who could tell us who had passed. 390\nThe Naval Treaty\n\u201cThen we returned to the of\ufb01ce, and searched\nthe stairs and the passage without result. The cor-\nridor which led to the room was laid down with a\nkind of creamy linoleum which shows an impres-\nsion very easily. We examined it very carefully, but\nfound no outline of any footmark.\u201d\n\u201cHad it been raining all evening?\u201d\n\u201cSince about seven.\u201d\n\u201cHow is it, then, that the woman who came\ninto the room about nine left no traces with her\nmuddy boots?\u201d\n\u201cI am glad you raised the point. It occurred to\nme at the time. The charwomen are in the habit\nof taking off their boots at the commissionaire\u2019s\nof\ufb01ce, and putting on list slippers.\u201d\n\u201cThat is very clear. There were no marks, then,\nthough the night was a wet one? The chain of\nevents is certainly one of extraordinary interest. What did you do next?\u201d\n\u201cWe examined the room also. There is no pos-\nsibility of a secret door, and the windows are quite\nthirty feet from the ground. Both of them were fas-\ntened on the inside. The carpet prevents any pos-\nsibility of a trap-door, and the ceiling is of the ordi-\nnary whitewashed kind. I will pledge my life that\nwhoever stole my papers could only have come\nthrough the door.\u201d\n\u201cHow about the \ufb01replace?\u201d\n\u201cThey use none. There is a stove. The bell-rope\nhangs from the wire just to the right of my desk. Whoever rang it must have come right up to the\ndesk to do it. But why should any criminal wish\nto ring the bell? It is a most insoluble mystery.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly the incident was unusual. What\nwere your next steps? You examined the room,\nI presume, to see if the intruder had left any\ntraces\u2014any cigar-end or dropped glove or hairpin\nor other tri\ufb02e?\u201d\n\u201cThere was nothing of the sort.\u201d\n\u201cNo smell?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we never thought of that.\u201d\n\u201cAh, a scent of tobacco would have been worth\na great deal to us in such an investigation.\u201d\n\u201cI never smoke myself, so I think I should have\nobserved it if there had been any smell of tobacco. There was absolutely no clue of any kind. The\nonly tangible fact was that the commissionaire\u2019s\nwife\u2014Mrs. Tangey was the name\u2014had hurried\nout of the place. He could give no explanation\nsave that it was about the time when the woman\nalways went home. The policeman and I agreed\nthat our best plan would be to seize the woman\nbefore she could get rid of the papers, presuming\nthat she had them."

We hired a hansom, and in half an hour we\nwere at the address which had been given to us. A young woman opened the door, who proved to\nbe Mrs. Tangey\u2019s eldest daughter. Her mother had\nnot come back yet, and we were shown into the\nfront room to wait. \u201cAbout ten minutes later a knock came at the\ndoor, and here we made the one serious mistake\nfor which I blame myself. Instead of opening the\ndoor ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. We\nheard her say, \u2018Mother, there are two men in the\nhouse waiting to see you,\u2019 and an instant after-\nwards we heard the patter of feet rushing down\nthe passage. Forbes \ufb02ung open the door, and we\nboth ran into the back room or kitchen, but the\nwoman had got there before us. She stared at us\nwith de\ufb01ant eyes, and then, suddenly recognizing\nme, an expression of absolute astonishment came\nover her face. \u201c \u2018Why, if it isn\u2019t Mr. Phelps, of the of\ufb01ce!\u2019 she\ncried. \u201c \u2018Come, come, who did you think we were\nwhen you ran away from us?\u2019 asked my compan-\nion. \u201c \u2018I thought you were the brokers,\u2019 said she, \u2018we\nhave had some trouble with a tradesman.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018That\u2019s not quite good enough,\u2019 answered\nForbes. \u2018We have reason to believe that you have\ntaken a paper of importance from the Foreign Of-\n\ufb01ce, and that you ran in here to dispose of it. You\nmust come back with us to Scotland Yard to be\nsearched.\u2019\n\u201cIt was in vain that she protested and resisted. A four-wheeler was brought, and we all three\ndrove back in it. We had \ufb01rst made an examina-\ntion of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen\n\ufb01re, to see whether she might have made away\nwith the papers during the instant that she was\nalone. There were no signs, however, of any ashes\nor scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard she\nwas handed over at once to the female searcher. I waited in an agony of suspense until she came\nback with her report. There were no signs of the\npapers. \u201cThen for the \ufb01rst time the horror of my situa-\ntion came in its full force. Hitherto I had been act-\ning, and action had numbed thought. I had been\nso con\ufb01dent of regaining the treaty at once that I\n391\nThe Naval Treaty\nhad not dared to think of what would be the con-\nsequence if I failed to do so. But now there was\nnothing more to be done, and I had leisure to re-\nalize my position. It was horrible. Watson there\nwould tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy\nat school. It is my nature. I thought of my uncle\nand of his colleagues in the Cabinet, of the shame\nwhich I had brought upon him, upon myself, upon\nevery one connected with me."

I was ruined, shamefully,\nhopelessly ruined. I don\u2019t know what I did. I fancy\nI must have made a scene. I have a dim recollection\nof a group of of\ufb01cials who crowded round me, en-\ndeavoring to soothe me. One of them drove down\nwith me to Waterloo, and saw me into the Wok-\ning train. I believe that he would have come all the\nway had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives near\nme, was going down by that very train. The doctor\nmost kindly took charge of me, and it was well he\ndid so, for I had a \ufb01t in the station, and before we\nreached home I was practically a raving maniac. \u201cYou can imagine the state of things here when\nthey were roused from their beds by the doctor\u2019s\nringing and found me in this condition. Poor An-\nnie here and my mother were broken-hearted. Dr.\nFerrier had just heard enough from the detective at\nthe station to be able to give an idea of what had\nhappened, and his story did not mend matters. It\nwas evident to all that I was in for a long illness,\nso Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom,\nand it was turned into a sick-room for me. Here I\nhave lain, Mr. Holmes, for over nine weeks, uncon-\nscious, and raving with brain-fever. If it had not\nbeen for Miss Harrison here and for the doctor\u2019s\ncare I should not be speaking to you now. She has\nnursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked\nafter me by night, for in my mad \ufb01ts I was capable\nof anything. Slowly my reason has cleared, but it\nis only during the last three days that my memory\nhas quite returned. Sometimes I wish that it never\nhad. The \ufb01rst thing that I did was to wire to Mr.\nForbes, who had the case in hand. He came out,\nand assures me that, though everything has been\ndone, no trace of a clue has been discovered. The\ncommissionaire and his wife have been examined\nin every way without any light being thrown upon\nthe matter. The suspicions of the police then rested\nupon young Gorot, who, as you may remember,\nstayed over time in the of\ufb01ce that night. His re-\nmaining behind and his French name were really\nthe only two points which could suggest suspicion;\nbut, as a matter of fact, I did not begin work until\nhe had gone, and his people are of Huguenot ex-\ntraction, but as English in sympathy and tradition\nas you and I are. Nothing was found to implicate\nhim in any way, and there the matter dropped. I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as absolutely my last\nhope. If you fail me, then my honor as well as my\nposition are forever forfeited.\u201d\nThe invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired\nout by this long recital, while his nurse poured him\nout a glass of some stimulating medicine."

If I can put\nthe man into your hands you shall hear from me. Come along, Watson.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we going to now?\u201d I asked, as we\nleft the of\ufb01ce. \u201cWe are now going to interview Lord Hold-\nhurst, the cabinet minister and future premier of\nEngland.\u201d\nWe were fortunate in \ufb01nding that Lord Hold-\nhurst was still in his chambers in Downing Street,\nand on Holmes sending in his card we were in-\nstantly shown up. The statesman received us\nwith that old-fashioned courtesy for which he is\nremarkable, and seated us on the two luxuriant\nlounges on either side of the \ufb01replace. Standing on\nthe rug between us, with his slight, tall \ufb01gure, his\nsharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair\nprematurely tinged with gray, he seemed to repre-\nsent that not to common type, a nobleman who is\nin truth noble. \u201cYour name is very familiar to me,\nMr.\nHolmes,\u201d said he, smiling. \u201cAnd, of course, I can-\nnot pretend to be ignorant of the object of your\nvisit. There has only been one occurrence in these\nof\ufb01ces which could call for your attention. In\nwhose interest are you acting, may I ask?\u201d\n\u201cIn\nthat\nof\nMr.\nPercy\nPhelps,\u201d\nanswered\nHolmes. \u201cAh, my unfortunate nephew! You can under-\nstand that our kinship makes it the more impossi-\nble for me to screen him in any way. I fear that the\nincident must have a very prejudicial effect upon\nhis career.\u201d\n\u201cBut if the document is found?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that, of course, would be different.\u201d\n\u201cI had one or two questions which I wished to\nask you, Lord Holdhurst.\u201d\n\u201cI shall be happy to give you any information\nin my power.\u201d\n\u201cWas it in this room that you gave your instruc-\ntions as to the copying of the document?\u201d\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\n\u201cThen you could hardly have been overheard?\u201d\n\u201cIt is out of the question.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever mention to any one that it was\nyour intention to give any one the treaty to be\ncopied?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cYou are certain of that?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\u201cWell, since you never said so, and Mr. Phelps\nnever said so, and nobody else knew anything of\nthe matter, then the thief\u2019s presence in the room\nwas purely accidental. He saw his chance and he\ntook it.\u201d\nThe statesman smiled. \u201cYou take me out of my\nprovince there,\u201d said he.

The treaty will cease to be secret in a few\nmonths.\u201d\n\u201cThat is most important,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cOf\ncourse, it is a possible supposition that the thief\nhas had a sudden illness\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAn attack of brain-fever, for example?\u201d asked\nthe statesman, \ufb02ashing a swift glance at him. \u201cI did not say so,\u201d said Holmes, imperturbably. \u201cAnd now, Lord Holdhurst, we have already taken\nup too much of your valuable time, and we shall\nwish you good-day.\u201d\n\u201cEvery success to your investigation, be the\ncriminal who it may,\u201d answered the nobleman, as\nhe bowed us out the door. \u201cHe\u2019s a \ufb01ne fellow,\u201d said Holmes, as we came\nout into Whitehall. \u201cBut he has a struggle to keep\nup his position. He is far from rich and has many\ncalls. You noticed, of course, that his boots had\nbeen resoled. Now, Watson, I won\u2019t detain you\nfrom your legitimate work any longer. I shall do\nnothing more to-day, unless I have an answer to\nmy cab advertisement. But I should be extremely\nobliged to you if you would come down with me\nto Woking to-morrow, by the same train which we\ntook yesterday.\u201d\nI met him accordingly next morning and we\ntraveled down to Woking together. He had had\nno answer to his advertisement, he said, and no\nfresh light had been thrown upon the case. He\nhad, when he so willed it, the utter immobility of\ncountenance of a red Indian, and I could not gather\nfrom his appearance whether he was satis\ufb01ed or\nnot with the position of the case. His conversa-\ntion, I remember, was about the Bertillon system\nof measurements, and he expressed his enthusias-\ntic admiration of the French savant. We found our client still under the charge of\nhis devoted nurse, but looking considerably better\nthan before. He rose from the sofa and greeted us\nwithout dif\ufb01culty when we entered. \u201cAny news?\u201d he asked, eagerly. \u201cMy report, as I expected, is a negative one,\u201d\nsaid Holmes. \u201cI have seen Forbes, and I have seen\nyour uncle, and I have set one or two trains of in-\nquiry upon foot which may lead to something.\u201d\n\u201cYou have not lost heart, then?\u201d\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\n\u201cGod bless you for saying that!\u201d cried Miss\nHarrison."

I was so much better that I thought I\ncould dispense with one. I had a night-light burn-\ning, however. Well, about two in the morning I\nhad sunk into a light sleep when I was suddenly\naroused by a slight noise. It was like the sound\nwhich a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank,\nand I lay listening to it for some time under the im-\npression that it must come from that cause. Then\nit grew louder, and suddenly there came from the\nwindow a sharp metallic snick. I sat up in amaze-\nment. There could be no doubt what the sounds\nwere now. The \ufb01rst ones had been caused by\nsome one forcing an instrument through the slit\nbetween the sashes, and the second by the catch\nbeing pressed back. \u201cThere was a pause then for about ten minutes,\nas if the person were waiting to see whether the\nnoise had awakened me. Then I heard a gentle\ncreaking as the window was very slowly opened. I could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not\nwhat they used to be. I sprang out of bed and\n\ufb02ung open the shutters. A man was crouching at\nthe window. I could see little of him, for he was\ngone like a \ufb02ash. He was wrapped in some sort\n396\nThe Naval Treaty\nof cloak which came across the lower part of his\nface. One thing only I am sure of, and that is that\nhe had some weapon in his hand. It looked to me\nlike a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as\nhe turned to run.\u201d\n\u201cThis is most interesting,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPray\nwhat did you do then?\u201d\n\u201cI should have followed him through the open\nwindow if I had been stronger. As it was, I rang\nthe bell and roused the house. It took me some\nlittle time, for the bell rings in the kitchen and the\nservants all sleep upstairs."

Her brother, however, had joined us\nand we set off all four together. We passed round\nthe lawn to the outside of the young diploma-\ntist\u2019s window. There were, as he had said, marks\nupon the bed, but they were hopelessly blurred\nand vague. Holmes stopped over them for an in-\nstant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t think any one could make much of\nthis,\u201d said he. \u201cLet us go round the house and see\nwhy this particular room was chose by the burglar.

There is a door here which\nhe might have attempted. What is it for?\u201d\n\u201cIt is the side entrance for trades-people. Of\ncourse it is locked at night.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever had an alarm like this before?\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d said our client. \u201cDo you keep plate in the house, or anything\nto attract burglars?\u201d\n\u201cNothing of value.\u201d\nHolmes strolled round the house with his\nhands in his pockets and a negligent air which was\nunusual with him. \u201cBy the way,\u201d said he to Joseph Harrison, \u201cyou\nfound some place, I understand, where the fellow\nscaled the fence. Let us have a look at that!\u201d\nThe plump young man led us to a spot where\nthe top of one of the wooden rails had been\ncracked. A small fragment of the wood was hang-\ning down. Holmes pulled it off and examined it\ncritically. \u201cDo you think that was done last night?

It sounds\nhigh-\ufb02own and absurd, but consider the fats!

Pre-\nsuming that your theory is correct, if he can lay\nhis hands upon the man who threatened you last\nnight he will have gone a long way towards \ufb01nding\nwho took the naval treaty. It is absurd to suppose\nthat you have two enemies, one of whom robs you,\nwhile the other threatens your life.\u201d\n\u201cBut Holmes said that he was not going to Bri-\narbrae.\u201d\n\u201cI have known him for some time,\u201d said I,\n\u201cbut I never knew him do anything yet without a\nvery good reason,\u201d and with that our conversation\ndrifted off on to other topics.

A few minutes later she brought in three covers,\nand we all drew up to the table, Holmes ravenous,\nI curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of de-\npression. \u201cMrs. Hudson has risen to the occasion,\u201d said\nHolmes, uncovering a dish of curried chicken. \u201cHer cuisine is a little limited, but she has as good\nan idea of breakfast as a Scotch-woman. What\nhave you here, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cHam and eggs,\u201d I answered. \u201cGood! What are you going to take, Mr.\nPhelps\u2014curried fowl or eggs, or will you help\nyourself?\u201d\n\u201cThank you. I can eat nothing,\u201d said Phelps. \u201cOh, come! Try the dish before you.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, I would really rather not.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d said Holmes, with a mischievous\ntwinkle, \u201cI suppose that you have no objection to\nhelping me?\u201d\nPhelps raised the cover, and as he did so he ut-\ntered a scream, and sat there staring with a face as\nwhite as the plate upon which he looked. Across\n399\nThe Naval Treaty\nthe centre of it was lying a little cylinder of blue-\ngray paper. He caught it up, devoured it with\nhis eyes, and then danced madly about the room,\npassing it to his bosom and shrieking out in his de-\nlight. Then he fell back into an arm-chair so limp\nand exhausted with his own emotions that we had\nto pour brandy down his throat to keep him from\nfainting. \u201cThere! there!\u201d said Holmes, soothing, patting\nhim upon the shoulder. \u201cIt was too bad to spring\nit on you like this, but Watson here will tell you\nthat I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.\u201d\nPhelps seized his hand and kissed it. \u201cGod\nbless you!\u201d he cried. \u201cYou have saved my honor.\u201d\n\u201cWell, my own was at stake, you know,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cI assure you it is just as hateful to me to\nfail in a case as it can be to you to blunder over a\ncommission.\u201d\nPhelps thrust away the precious document into\nthe innermost pocket of his coat."

Then he rose, lit his pipe, and settled himself down\ninto his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I did \ufb01rst, and how I came\nto do it afterwards,\u201d said he. \u201cAfter leaving you\nat the station I went for a charming walk through\nsome admirable Surrey scenery to a pretty little\nvillage called Ripley, where I had my tea at an inn,\nand took the precaution of \ufb01lling my \ufb02ask and of\nputting a paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There\nI remained until evening, when I set off for Woking\nagain, and found myself in the high-road outside\nBriarbrae just after sunset. \u201cWell, I waited until the road was clear\u2014it\nis never a very frequented one at any time, I\nfancy\u2014and then I clambered over the fence into\nthe grounds.\u201d\n\u201cSurely the gate was open!\u201d ejaculated Phelps. \u201cYes, but I have a peculiar taste in these mat-\nters. I chose the place where the three \ufb01r-trees\nstand, and behind their screen I got over with-\nout the least chance of any one in the house be-\ning able to see me. I crouched down among\nthe bushes on the other side, and crawled from\none to the other\u2014witness the disreputable state of\nmy trouser knees\u2014until I had reached the clump\nof rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom\nwindow. There I squatted down and awaited de-\nvelopments. \u201cThe blind was not down in your room, and I\ncould see Miss Harrison sitting there reading by\nthe table. It was quarter-past ten when she closed\nher book, fastened the shutters, and retired. \u201cI heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure\nthat she had turned the key in the lock.\u201d\n\u201cThe key!\u201d ejaculated Phelps. \u201cYes, I had given Miss Harrison instructions to\nlock the door on the outside and take the key with\nher when she went to bed. She carried out every\none of my injunctions to the letter, and certainly\nwithout her cooperation you would not have that\npaper in you coat-pocket. She departed then and\nthe lights went out, and I was left squatting in the\nrhododendron-bush. \u201cThe night was \ufb01ne, but still it was a very\nweary vigil. Of course it has the sort of excite-\nment about it that the sportsman feels when he\nlies beside the water-course and waits for the big\ngame. It was very long, though\u2014almost as long,\nWatson, as when you and I waited in that deadly\nroom when we looked into the little problem of the\nSpeckled Band. There was a church-clock down at\nWoking which struck the quarters, and I thought\nmore than once that it had stopped. At last how-\never about two in the morning, I suddenly heard\nthe gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back and\nthe creaking of a key."

He\nwalked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall,\nand when he reached the window he worked a\nlong-bladed knife through the sash and pushed\nback the catch. Then he \ufb02ung open the window,\nand putting his knife through the crack in the shut-\nters, he thrust the bar up and swung them open. \u201cFrom where I lay I had a perfect view of the\ninside of the room and of every one of his move-\nments. He lit the two candles which stood upon\nthe mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn\nback the corner of the carpet in the neighborhood\nof the door. Presently he stopped and picked out a\nsquare piece of board, such as is usually left to\nenable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas-\npipes. This one covered, as a matter of fact, the\nT joint which gives off the pipe which supplies\nthe kitchen underneath. Out of this hiding-place\nhe drew that little cylinder of paper, pushed down\n400\nThe Naval Treaty\nthe board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the can-\ndles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood\nwaiting for him outside the window. \u201cWell, he has rather more viciousness than I\ngave him credit for, has Master Joseph. He \ufb02ew at\nme with his knife, and I had to grasp him twice,\nand got a cut over the knuckles, before I had the\nupper hand of him. He looked murder out of the\nonly eye he could see with when we had \ufb01nished,\nbut he listened to reason and gave up the papers. Having got them I let my man go, but I wired full\nparticulars to Forbes this morning. If he is quick\nenough to catch is bird, well and good. But if, as\nI shrewdly suspect, he \ufb01nds the nest empty before\nhe gets there, why, all the better for the govern-\nment. I fancy that Lord Holdhurst for one, and Mr.\nPercy Phelps for another, would very much rather\nthat the affair never got as far as a police-court. \u201cMy God!\u201d gasped our client. \u201cDo you tell\nme that during these long ten weeks of agony the\nstolen papers were within the very room with me\nall the time?\u201d\n\u201cSo it was.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Joseph! Joseph a villain and a thief!\u201d\n\u201cHum! I am afraid Joseph\u2019s character is a\nrather deeper and more dangerous one than one\nmight judge from his appearance. From what I\nhave heard from him this morning, I gather that he\nhas lost heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that\nhe is ready to do anything on earth to better his\nfortunes. Being an absolutely sel\ufb01sh man, when a\nchance presented itself he did not allow either his\nsister\u2019s happiness or your reputation to hold his\nhand.\u201d\nPercy Phelps sank back in his chair."

What\nwas vital was overlaid and hidden by what was\nirrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented\nto us we had to pick just those which we deemed\nto be essential, and then piece them together in\ntheir order, so as to reconstruct this very remark-\nable chain of events. I had already begun to sus-\npect Joseph, from the fact that you had intended\nto travel home with him that night, and that there-\nfore it was a likely enough thing that he should call\nfor you, knowing the Foreign Of\ufb01ce well, upon his\nway. When I heard that some one had been so anx-\nious to get into the bedroom, in which no one but\nJoseph could have concealed anything\u2014you told\nus in your narrative how you had turned Joseph\nout when you arrived with the doctor\u2014my suspi-\ncions all changed to certainties, especially as the\nattempt was made on the \ufb01rst night upon which\nthe nurse was absent, showing that the intruder\nwas well acquainted with the ways of the house.\u201d\n\u201cHow blind I have been!\u201d\n\u201cThe facts of the case, as far as I have worked\nthem out, are these: this Joseph Harrison entered\nthe of\ufb01ce through the Charles Street door, and\nknowing his way he walked straight into your\nroom the instant after you left it. Finding no one\nthere he promptly rang the bell, and at the instant\nthat he did so his eyes caught the paper upon the\ntable. A glance showed him that chance had put in\nhis way a State document of immense value, and\nin an instant he had thrust it into his pocket and\nwas gone. A few minutes elapsed, as you remem-\nber, before the sleepy commissionaire drew your\nattention to the bell, and those were just enough to\ngive the thief time to make his escape. \u201cHe made his way to Woking by the \ufb01rst train,\nand having examined his booty and assured him-\nself that it really was of immense value, he had\nconcealed it in what he thought was a very safe\nplace, with the intention of taking it out again in a\nday or two, and carrying it to the French embassy,\nor wherever he thought that a long price was to\nbe had. Then came your sudden return. He, with-\nout a moment\u2019s warning, was bundled out of his\nroom, and from that time onward there were al-\nways at least two of you there to prevent him from\nregaining his treasure. The situation to him must\nhave been a maddening one. But at last he thought\nhe saw his chance. He tried to steal in, but was baf-\n\ufb02ed by your wakefulness. You remember that you\ndid not take your usual draught that night.\u201d\n\u201cI remember.\u201d\n\u201cI fancy that he had taken steps to make that\ndraught ef\ufb01cacious, and that he quite relied upon\nyour being unconscious."

As far as\nI know, there have been only three accounts in the\npublic press: that in the Journal de Gen`eve on May\n6th, 1891, the Reuter\u2019s despatch in the English pa-\npers on May 7th, and \ufb01nally the recent letters to\nwhich I have alluded.

It may be remembered that after my marriage,\nand my subsequent start in private practice, the\nvery intimate relations which had existed between\nHolmes and myself became to some extent modi-\n\ufb01ed. He still came to me from time to time when\nhe desired a companion in his investigation, but\nthese occasions grew more and more seldom, un-\ntil I \ufb01nd that in the year 1890 there were only\nthree cases of which I retain any record. Dur-\ning the winter of that year and the early spring\nof 1891, I saw in the papers that he had been\nengaged by the French government upon a mat-\nter of supreme importance, and I received two\nnotes from Holmes, dated from Narbonne and\nfrom Nimes, from which I gathered that his stay\nin France was likely to be a long one. It was with\nsome surprise, therefore, that I saw him walk into\nmy consulting-room upon the evening of April\n24th. It struck me that he was looking even paler\nand thinner than usual. \u201cYes, I have been using myself up rather too\nfreely,\u201d he remarked, in answer to my look rather\nthan to my words; \u201cI have been a little pressed of\nlate. Have you any objection to my closing your\nshutters?\u201d\nThe only light in the room came from the\nlamp upon the table at which I had been reading. Holmes edged his way round the wall and \ufb02inging\nthe shutters together, he bolted them securely. \u201cYou are afraid of something?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, I am.\u201d\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\n\u201cOf air-guns.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes, what do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI think that you know me well enough, Wat-\nson, to understand that I am by no means a ner-\nvous man. At the same time, it is stupidity rather\nthan courage to refuse to recognize danger when\nit is close upon you. Might I trouble you for a\nmatch?\u201d He drew in the smoke of his cigarette as\nif the soothing in\ufb02uence was grateful to him. \u201cI must apologize for calling so late,\u201d said he,\n\u201cand I must further beg you to be so unconven-\ntional as to allow me to leave your house presently\nby scrambling over your back garden wall.\u201d\n\u201cBut what does it all mean?\u201d I asked. He held out his hand, and I saw in the light of\nthe lamp that two of his knuckles were burst and\nbleeding. \u201cIt is not an airy nothing, you see,\u201d said he,\nsmiling. \u201cOn the contrary, it is solid enough for a\nman to break his hand over. Is Mrs. Watson in?\u201d\n\u201cShe is away upon a visit.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed!

He saw the question in my eyes, and, putting his\n\ufb01nger-tips together and his elbows upon his knees,\nhe explained the situation. \u201cYou have probably never heard of Professor\nMoriarty?\u201d said he. \u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cAye, there\u2019s the genius and the wonder of the\nthing!\u201d he cried. \u201cThe man pervades London, and\nno one has heard of him.

I tell you,\nWatson, in all seriousness, that if I could beat that\nman, if I could free society of him, I should feel\nthat my own career had reached its summit, and\nI should be prepared to turn to some more placid\nline in life. Between ourselves, the recent cases in\nwhich I have been of assistance to the royal family\nof Scandinavia, and to the French republic, have\nleft me in such a position that I could continue to\nlive in the quiet fashion which is most congenial\nto me, and to concentrate my attention upon my\nchemical researches.

He\nis a man of good birth and excellent education, en-\ndowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical\nfaculty. At the age of twenty-one he wrote a trea-\ntise upon the Binomial Theorem, which has had\na European vogue. On the strength of it he won\nthe Mathematical Chair at one of our smaller uni-\nversities, and had, to all appearance, a most bril-\nliant career before him. But the man had hered-\nitary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A\ncriminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of\nbeing modi\ufb01ed, was increased and rendered in-\n\ufb01nitely more dangerous by his extraordinary men-\ntal powers. Dark rumors gathered round him in\nthe university town, and eventually he was com-\npelled to resign his chair and to come down to\nLondon, where he set up as an army coach. So\nmuch is known to the world, but what I am telling\nyou now is what I have myself discovered. \u201cAs you are aware, Watson, there is no one\nwho knows the higher criminal world of London\nso well as I do. For years past I have continually\nbeen conscious of some power behind the male-\nfactor, some deep organizing power which forever\nstands in the way of the law, and throws its shield\nover the wrong-doer. Again and again in cases of\nthe most varying sorts\u2014forgery cases, robberies,\nmurders\u2014I have felt the presence of this force, and\nI have deduced its action in many of those undis-\ncovered crimes in which I have not been personally\nconsulted."

He is\nthe organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all\nthat is undetected in this great city. He is a genius,\na philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain\nof the \ufb01rst order. He sits motionless, like a spider\nin the center of its web, but that web has a thou-\nsand radiations, and he knows well every quiver\nof each of them. He does little himself. He only\nplans.

Is there a crime to be done, a\npaper to be abstracted, we will say, a house to be\nri\ufb02ed, a man to be removed\u2014the word is passed\nto the Professor, the matter is organized and car-\nried out. The agent may be caught. In that case\nmoney is found for his bail or his defence. But\nthe central power which uses the agent is never\ncaught\u2014never so much as suspected. This was the\norganization which I deduced, Watson, and which\nI devoted my whole energy to exposing and break-\ning up. \u201cBut the Professor was fenced round with\nsafeguards so cunningly devised that, do what I\nwould, it seemed impossible to get evidence which\nwould convict in a court of law. You know my\npowers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of\nthree months I was forced to confess that I had\nat last met an antagonist who was my intellec-\ntual equal. My horror at his crimes was lost in\nmy admiration at his skill. But at last he made a\ntrip\u2014only a little, little trip\u2014but it was more than\nhe could afford when I was so close upon him.

But he was too wily for that. He saw\nevery step which I took to draw my toils round\nhim. Again and again he strove to break away, but\nI as often headed him off. I tell you, my friend, that\nif a detailed account of that silent contest could be\nwritten, it would take its place as the most brilliant\nbit of thrust-and-parry work in the history of de-\ntection."

His appearance was quite famil-\niar to me. He is extremely tall and thin, his fore-\nhead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes\nare deeply sunken in his head. He is clean-shaven,\npale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of\nthe professor in his features.

It is necessary that you\nshould withdraw. You have worked things in such\na fashion that we have only one resource left. It\nhas been an intellectual treat to me to see the way\nin which you have grappled with this affair, and I\nsay, unaffectedly, that it would be a grief to me to\nbe forced to take any extreme measure. You smile,\nsir, abut I assure you that it really would.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Danger is part of my trade,\u2019 I remarked. \u201c \u2018That is not danger,\u2019 said he. \u2018It is inevitable\ndestruction. You stand in the way not merely of\nan individual, but of a mighty organization, the\nfull extent of which you, with all your cleverness,\nhave been unable to realize. You must stand clear,\nMr. Holmes, or be trodden under foot.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I am afraid,\u2019 said I, rising, \u2018that in the plea-\nsure of this conversation I am neglecting business\nof importance which awaits me elsewhere.\u2019\n\u201cHe rose also and looked at me in silence, shak-\ning his head sadly. \u201c \u2018Well, well,\u2019 said he, at last. \u2018It seems a pity,\nbut I have done what I could. I know every move\nof your game. You can do nothing before Mon-\nday. It has been a duel between you and me, Mr.\nHolmes. You hope to place me in the dock. I tell\nyou that I will never stand in the dock. You hope\nto beat me. I tell you that you will never beat me. If you are clever enough to bring destruction upon\nme, rest assured that I shall do as much to you.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You have paid me several compliments, Mr.\nMoriarty,\u2019 said I. \u2018Let me pay you one in return\nwhen I say that if I were assured of the former\neventuality I would, in the interests of the public,\ncheerfully accept the latter.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I can promise you the one, but not the other,\u2019\nhe snarled, and so turned his rounded back upon\nme, and went peering and blinking out of the\nroom. \u201cThat was my singular interview with Profes-\nsor Moriarty. I confess that it left an unpleasant\neffect upon my mind. His soft, precise fashion\nof speech leaves a conviction of sincerity which\na mere bully could not produce. Of course, you\nwill say: \u2018Why not take police precautions against\nhim?\u2019 the reason is that I am well convinced that\n407\nThe Final Problem\nit is from his agents the blow will fall. I have the\nbest proofs that it would be so.\u201d\n\u201cYou have already been assaulted?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Watson, Professor Moriarty is not a\nman who lets the grass grow under his feet. I\nwent out about mid-day to transact some business\nin Oxford Street. As I passed the corner which\nleads from Bentinck Street on to the Welbeck Street\ncrossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed\nround and was on me like a \ufb02ash."

I kept to the pave-\nment after that, Watson, but as I walked down Vere\nStreet a brick came down from the roof of one of\nthe houses, and was shattered to fragments at my\nfeet. I called the police and had the place exam-\nined. There were slates and bricks piled up on the\nroof preparatory to some repairs, and they would\nhave me believe that the wind had toppled over\none of these. Of course I knew better, but I could\nprove nothing. I took a cab after that and reached\nmy brother\u2019s rooms in Pall Mall, where I spent the\nday. Now I have come round to you, and on my\nway I was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. I knocked him down, and the police have him in\ncustody; but I can tell you with the most absolute\ncon\ufb01dence that no possible connection will ever be\ntraced between the gentleman upon whose front\nteeth I have barked my knuckles and the retiring\nmathematical coach, who is, I dare say, working\nout problems upon a black-board ten miles away. You will not wonder, Watson, that my \ufb01rst act on\nentering your rooms was to close your shutters,\nand that I have been compelled to ask your permis-\nsion to leave the house by some less conspicuous\nexit than the front door.\u201d\nI had often admired my friend\u2019s courage, but\nnever more than now, as he sat quietly checking off\na series of incidents which must have combined to\nmake up a day of horror. \u201cYou will spend the night here?\u201d I said. \u201cNo, my friend, you might \ufb01nd me a danger-\nous guest. I have my plans laid, and all will be\nwell. Matters have gone so far now that they can\nmove without my help as far as the arrest goes,\nthough my presence is necessary for a conviction. It is obvious, therefore, that I cannot do better than\nget away for the few days which remain before the\npolice are at liberty to act. It would be a great plea-\nsure to me, therefore, if you could come on to the\nContinent with me.\u201d\n\u201cThe practice is quiet,\u201d said I, \u201cand I have an\naccommodating neighbor. I should be glad to\ncome.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to start to-morrow morning?\u201d\n\u201cIf necessary.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, it is most necessary. Then these are\nyour instructions, and I beg, my dear Watson, that\nyou will obey them to the letter, for you are now\nplaying a double-handed game with me against\nthe cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndi-\ncate of criminals in Europe. Now listen! You will\ndispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a\ntrusty messenger unaddressed to Victoria to-night. In the morning you will send for a hansom, de-\nsiring your man to take neither the \ufb01rst nor the\nsecond which may present itself."

Have your fare\nready, and the instant that your cab stops, dash\nthrough the Arcade, timing yourself to reach the\nother side at a quarter-past nine. You will \ufb01nd a\nsmall brougham waiting close to the curb, driven\nby a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped at the\ncollar with red.

It was evident to me that he thought\nhe might bring trouble to the roof he was under,\nand that that was the motive which impelled him\nto go. With a few hurried words as to our plans for\nthe morrow he rose and came out with me into the\ngarden, clambering over the wall which leads into\nMortimer Street, and immediately whistling for a\nhansom, in which I heard him drive away. In the morning I obeyed Holmes\u2019s injunctions\nto the letter. A hansom was procured with such\nprecaution as would prevent its being one which\nwas placed ready for us, and I drove immediately\nafter breakfast to the Lowther Arcade, through\nwhich I hurried at the top of my speed. A\nbrougham was waiting with a very massive driver\nwrapped in a dark cloak, who, the instant that I\nhad stepped in, whipped up the horse and rattled\noff to Victoria Station. On my alighting there he\n408\nThe Final Problem\nturned the carriage, and dashed away again with-\nout so much as a look in my direction. So far all had gone admirably. My luggage was\nwaiting for me, and I had no dif\ufb01culty in \ufb01nd-\ning the carriage which Holmes had indicated, the\nless so as it was the only one in the train which\nwas marked \u201cEngaged.\u201d My only source of anxi-\nety now was the non-appearance of Holmes. The\nstation clock marked only seven minutes from the\ntime when we were due to start. In vain I searched\namong the groups of travellers and leave-takers for\nthe lithe \ufb01gure of my friend. There was no sign of\nhim. I spent a few minutes in assisting a venera-\nble Italian priest, who was endeavoring to make a\nporter understand, in his broken English, that his\nluggage was to be booked through to Paris. Then,\nhaving taken another look round, I returned to my\ncarriage, where I found that the porter, in spite of\nthe ticket, had given me my decrepit Italian friend\nas a traveling companion. It was useless for me to\nexplain to him that his presence was an intrusion,\nfor my Italian was even more limited than his En-\nglish, so I shrugged my shoulders resignedly, and\ncontinued to look out anxiously for my friend."

The\naged ecclesiastic had turned his face towards me. For an instant the wrinkles were smoothed away,\nthe nose drew away from the chin, the lower lip\nceased to protrude and the mouth to mumble, the\ndull eyes regained their \ufb01re, the drooping \ufb01gure\nexpanded. The next the whole frame collapsed\nagain, and Holmes had gone as quickly as he had\ncome. \u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried; \u201chow you startled\nme!\u201d\n\u201cEvery precaution is still necessary,\u201d he whis-\npered. \u201cI have reason to think that they are hot\nupon our trail. Ah, there is Moriarty himself.\u201d\nThe train had already begun to move as\nHolmes spoke. Glancing back, I saw a tall man\npushing his way furiously through the crowd, and\nwaving his hand as if he desired to have the train\nstopped. It was too late, however, for we were\nrapidly gathering momentum, and an instant later\nhad shot clear of the station. \u201cWith all our precautions, you see that we have\ncut it rather \ufb01ne,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. He rose,\nand throwing off the black cassock and hat which\nhad formed his disguise, he packed them away in\na hand-bag. \u201cHave you seen the morning paper, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen about Baker Street, then?\u201d\n\u201cBaker Street?\u201d\n\u201cThey set \ufb01re to our rooms last night.

It is an advantage\nto get about in such a case without taking a merce-\nnary into your con\ufb01dence.

You do not imagine that if I were the\npursuer I should allow myself to be baf\ufb02ed by so\nslight an obstacle.

For a charming week we wandered up the Val-\nley of the Rhone, and then, branching off at Leuk,\nwe made our way over the Gemmi Pass, still deep\nin snow, and so, by way of Interlaken, to Meirin-\ngen. It was a lovely trip, the dainty green of the\nspring below, the virgin white of the winter above;\nbut it was clear to me that never for one instant\ndid Holmes forget the shadow which lay across\nhim.

Once, I remember, as we passed over the\nGemmi, and walked along the border of the\nmelancholy Daubensee, a large rock which had\nbeen dislodged from the ridge upon our right clat-\ntered down and roared into the lake behind us. In\nan instant Holmes had raced up on to the ridge,\nand, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his\nneck in every direction.

On the contrary, I can never recollect\nhaving seen him in such exuberant spirits.

Your memoirs will draw to an end, Watson,\nupon the day that I crown my career by the capture\nor extinction of the most dangerous and capable\ncriminal in Europe.\u201d\nI shall be brief, and yet exact, in the little which\nremains for me to tell. It is not a subject on which I\nwould willingly dwell, and yet I am conscious that\na duty devolves upon me to omit no detail. It was on the third of May that we reached the\nlittle village of Meiringen, where we put up at the\nEnglischer Hof, then kept by Peter Steiler the el-\nder. Our landlord was an intelligent man, and\nspoke excellent English, having served for three\nyears as waiter at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. At his advice, on the afternoon of the fourth we set\noff together, with the intention of crossing the hills\nand spending the night at the hamlet of Rosenlaui. We had strict injunctions, however, on no account\nto pass the falls of Reichenbach, which are about\nhalf-way up the hill, without making a small de-\ntour to see them. It is, indeed, a fearful place. The torrent,\nswollen by the melting snow, plunges into a\ntremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up\nlike the smoke from a burning house. The shaft\ninto which the river hurls itself is an immense\nchasm, lined by glistening coal-black rock, and\nnarrowing into a creaming, boiling pit of incal-\nculable depth, which brims over and shoots the\nstream onward over its jagged lip. The long sweep\nof green water roaring forever down, and the thick\n\ufb02ickering curtain of spray hissing forever upward,\nturn a man giddy with their constant whirl and\nclamor. We stood near the edge peering down\nat the gleam of the breaking water far below us\nagainst the black rocks, and listening to the half-\nhuman shout which came booming up with the\nspray out of the abyss. The path has been cut half-way round the fall\nto afford a complete view, but it ends abruptly,\nand the traveler has to return as he came. We had\nturned to do so, when we saw a Swiss lad come\nrunning along it with a letter in his hand. It bore\nthe mark of the hotel which we had just left, and\nwas addressed to me by the landlord. It appeared\nthat within a very few minutes of our leaving,\nan English lady had arrived who was in the last\nstage of consumption. She had wintered at Davos\nPlatz, and was journeying now to join her friends\nat Lucerne, when a sudden hemorrhage had over-\ntaken her. It was thought that she could hardly\nlive a few hours, but it would be a great consola-\ntion to her to see an English doctor, and, if I would\nonly return, etc."

The appeal was one which could not be ig-\nnored. It was impossible to refuse the request of\na fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange land. Yet I had my scruples about leaving Holmes. It\nwas \ufb01nally agreed, however, that he should retain\nthe young Swiss messenger with him as guide and\ncompanion while I returned to Meiringen. My\nfriend would stay some little time at the fall, he\nsaid, and would then walk slowly over the hill\nto Rosenlaui, where I was to rejoin him in the\nevening. As I turned away I saw Holmes, with\nhis back against a rock and his arms folded, gaz-\ning down at the rush of the waters. It was the last\nthat I was ever destined to see of him in this world. When I was near the bottom of the descent I\nlooked back. It was impossible, from that posi-\ntion, to see the fall, but I could see the curving\npath which winds over the shoulder of the hill and\nleads to it. Along this a man was, I remember,\nwalking very rapidly. I could see his black \ufb01gure clearly outlined\nagainst the green behind him. I noted him, and\nthe energy with which he walked but he passed\nfrom my mind again as I hurried on upon my er-\nrand. It may have been a little over an hour before I\nreached Meiringen. Old Steiler was standing at the\nporch of his hotel. \u201cWell,\u201d said I, as I came hurrying up, \u201cI trust\nthat she is no worse?\u201d\nA look of surprise passed over his face, and at\nthe \ufb01rst quiver of his eyebrows my heart turned to\nlead in my breast. \u201cYou did not write this?\u201d I said, pulling the let-\nter from my pocket. \u201cThere is no sick English-\nwoman in the hotel?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not!\u201d he cried. \u201cBut it has the hotel\nmark upon it!

In a tingle of fear I was already running\ndown the village street, and making for the path\nwhich I had so lately descended. It had taken me\nan hour to come down. For all my efforts two more\nhad passed before I found myself at the fall of Re-\nichenbach once more. There was Holmes\u2019s Alpine-\nstock still leaning against the rock by which I had\nleft him. But there was no sign of him, and it was\nin vain that I shouted. My only answer was my\nown voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the\ncliffs around me. It was the sight of that Alpine-stock which\nturned me cold and sick."

The young Swiss had gone too. He had prob-\nably been in the pay of Moriarty, and had left the\ntwo men together. And then what had happened? Who was to tell us what had happened then? I stood for a minute or two to collect myself,\nfor I was dazed with the horror of the thing. Then\nI began to think of Holmes\u2019s own methods and\nto try to practise them in reading this tragedy. It\nwas, alas, only too easy to do. During our con-\nversation we had not gone to the end of the path,\nand the Alpine-stock marked the place where we\nhad stood. The blackish soil is kept forever soft\nby the incessant drift of spray, and a bird would\nleave its tread upon it. Two lines of footmarks\nwere clearly marked along the farther end of the\npath, both leading away from me. There were\nnone returning. A few yards from the end the\nsoil was all ploughed up into a patch of mud, and\nthe branches and ferns which fringed the chasm\nwere torn and bedraggled. I lay upon my face and\npeered over with the spray spouting up all around\nme. It had darkened since I left, and now I could\nonly see here and there the glistening of moisture\nupon the black walls, and far away down at the\nend of the shaft the gleam of the broken water. I\nshouted; but only the same half-human cry of the\nfall was borne back to my ears. But it was destined that I should after all have\na last word of greeting from my friend and com-\nrade. I have said that his Alpine-stock had been\nleft leaning against a rock which jutted on to the\npath. From the top of this bowlder the gleam of\nsomething bright caught my eye, and, raising my\nhand, I found that it came from the silver cigarette-\ncase which he used to carry. As I took it up a small\nsquare of paper upon which it had lain \ufb02uttered\ndown on to the ground. Unfolding it, I found that\nit consisted of three pages torn from his note-book\nand addressed to me. It was characteristic of the\nman that the direction was as precise, and the writ-\ning as \ufb01rm and clear, as though it had been written\nin his study. My dear Watson [it said]:\nI write these few lines through the\ncourtesy of Mr. Moriarty, who awaits\nmy convenience for the \ufb01nal discussion\nof those questions which lie between\nus. He has been giving me a sketch\nof the methods by which he avoided\nthe English police and kept himself in-\nformed of our movements.

The crime was of interest\nin itself, but that interest was as nothing to me\ncompared to the inconceivable sequel, which af-\nforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any\nevent in my adventurous life. Even now, after\nthis long interval, I \ufb01nd myself thrilling as I think\nof it, and feeling once more that sudden \ufb02ood of\njoy, amazement, and incredulity which utterly sub-\nmerged my mind. Let me say to that public which\nhas shown some interest in those glimpses which I\nhave occasionally given them of the thoughts and\nactions of a very remarkable man that they are not\nto blame me if I have not shared my knowledge\nwith them, for I should have considered it my \ufb01rst\nduty to have done so had I not been barred by a\npositive prohibition from his own lips, which was\nonly withdrawn upon the third of last month. It can be imagined that my close intimacy\nwith Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply\nin crime, and that after his disappearance I never\nfailed to read with care the various problems\nwhich came before the public, and I even at-\ntempted more than once for my own private sat-\nisfaction to employ his methods in their solution,\nthough with indifferent success. There was none,\nhowever, which appealed to me like this tragedy\nof Ronald Adair. As I read the evidence at the in-\nquest, which led up to a verdict of wilful murder\nagainst some person or persons unknown, I real-\nized more clearly than I had ever done the loss\nwhich the community had sustained by the death\nof Sherlock Holmes. There were points about this\nstrange business which would, I was sure, have\nspecially appealed to him, and the efforts of the\npolice would have been supplemented, or more\nprobably anticipated, by the trained observation\nand the alert mind of the \ufb01rst criminal agent in Eu-\nrope. All day as I drove upon my round I turned\nover the case in my mind, and found no explana-\ntion which appeared to me to be adequate. At the\nrisk of telling a twice-told tale I will recapitulate\nthe facts as they were known to the public at the\nconclusion of the inquest. The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second\nson of the Earl of Maynooth, at that time Governor\nof one of the Australian Colonies. Adair\u2019s mother\nhad returned from Australia to undergo the opera-\ntion for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her\ndaughter Hilda were living together at 427, Park\nLane. The youth moved in the best society, had, so\nfar as was known, no enemies, and no particular\nvices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith Wood-\nley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been bro-\nken off by mutual consent some months before,\nand there was no sign that it had left any very pro-\nfound feeling behind it."

Yet\nit was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that\ndeath came in most strange and unexpected form\nbetween the hours of ten and eleven-twenty on the\nnight of March 30, 1894. Ronald Adair was fond of cards, playing con-\ntinually, but never for such stakes as would hurt\nhim. He was a member of the Baldwin, the\nCavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs. It was\nshown that after dinner on the day of his death\nhe had played a rubber of whist at the latter\nclub. He had also played there in the after-\nnoon. The evidence of those who had played with\nhim\u2014Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel\nMoran\u2014showed that the game was whist, and that\nthere was a fairly equal fall of the cards. Adair\nmight have lost \ufb01ve pounds, but not more. His for-\ntune was a considerable one, and such a loss could\nnot in any way affect him. He had played nearly\nevery day at one club or other, but he was a cau-\ntious player, and usually rose a winner. It came\nout in evidence that in partnership with Colonel\nMoran he had actually won as much as four hun-\ndred and twenty pounds in a sitting some weeks\nbefore from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral. So much for his recent history, as it came out at\nthe inquest. On the evening of the crime he returned from\nthe club exactly at ten. His mother and sister were\nout spending the evening with a relation. The ser-\nvant deposed that she heard him enter the front\nroom on the second \ufb02oor, generally used as his\nsitting-room. She had lit a \ufb01re there, and as it\nsmoked she had opened the window. No sound\nwas heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the\nhour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her\ndaughter. Desiring to say good-night, she had at-\ntempted to enter her son\u2019s room. The door was\nlocked on the inside, and no answer could be got\n419\nThe Adventure of the Empty House\nto their cries and knocking. Help was obtained\nand the door forced. The unfortunate young man\nwas found lying near the table. His head had been\nhorribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bul-\nlet, but no weapon of any sort was to be found\nin the room. On the table lay two bank-notes for\nten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in sil-\nver and gold, the money arranged in little piles\nof varying amount. There were some \ufb01gures also\nupon a sheet of paper with the names of some club\nfriends opposite to them, from which it was con-\njectured that before his death he was endeavouring\nto make out his losses or winnings at cards. A minute examination of the circumstances\nserved only to make the case more complex. In\nthe \ufb01rst place, no reason could be given why the\nyoung man should have fastened the door upon\nthe inside."

The drop was at least twenty feet,\nhowever, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay\nbeneath. Neither the \ufb02owers nor the earth showed\nany sign of having been disturbed, nor were there\nany marks upon the narrow strip of grass which\nseparated the house from the road. Apparently,\ntherefore, it was the young man himself who had\nfastened the door. But how did he come by his\ndeath? No one could have climbed up to the win-\ndow without leaving traces. Suppose a man had\n\ufb01red through the window, it would indeed be a\nremarkable shot who could with a revolver in-\n\ufb02ict so deadly a wound. Again, Park Lane is a\nfrequented thoroughfare, and there is a cab-stand\nwithin a hundred yards of the house. No one had\nheard a shot. And yet there was the dead man,\nand there the revolver bullet, which had mush-\nroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so in-\n\ufb02icted a wound which must have caused instanta-\nneous death. Such were the circumstances of the\nPark Lane Mystery, which were further compli-\ncated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have\nsaid, young Adair was not known to have any en-\nemy, and no attempt had been made to remove the\nmoney or valuables in the room. All day I turned these facts over in my mind,\nendeavouring to hit upon some theory which\ncould reconcile them all, and to \ufb01nd that line of\nleast resistance which my poor friend had declared\nto be the starting-point of every investigation. I\nconfess that I made little progress. In the evening\nI strolled across the Park, and found myself about\nsix o\u2019clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane. A group of loafers upon the pavements, all star-\ning up at a particular window, directed me to the\nhouse which I had come to see. A tall, thin man\nwith coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected\nof being a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out\nsome theory of his own, while the others crowded\nround to listen to what he said. I got as near him\nas I could, but his observations seemed to me to be\nabsurd, so I withdrew again in some disgust. As\nI did so I struck against an elderly deformed man,\nwho had been behind me, and I knocked down\nseveral books which he was carrying. I remember\nthat as I picked them up I observed the title of one\nof them, The Origin of Tree Worship, and it struck me\nthat the fellow must be some poor bibliophile who,\neither as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of\nobscure volumes. I endeavoured to apologize for\nthe accident, but it was evident that these books\nwhich I had so unfortunately maltreated were very\nprecious objects in the eyes of their owner. With a\nsnarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I\nsaw his curved back and white side-whiskers dis-\nappear among the throng."

The house was separated from the street by\na low wall and railing, the whole not more than\n\ufb01ve feet high. It was perfectly easy, therefore, for\nanyone to get into the garden, but the window was\nentirely inaccessible, since there was no water-pipe\nor anything which could help the most active man\nto climb it. More puzzled than ever I retraced my\nsteps to Kensington. I had not been in my study\n\ufb01ve minutes when the maid entered to say that a\nperson desired to see me. To my astonishment it\nwas none other than my strange old book-collector,\nhis sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame\nof white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen\nof them at least, wedged under his right arm. \u201cYou\u2019re surprised to see me, sir,\u201d said he, in a\nstrange, croaking voice. I acknowledged that I was. \u201cWell,\nI\u2019ve a conscience,\nsir,\nand when I\nchanced to see you go into this house, as I came\nhobbling after you, I thought to myself, I\u2019ll just\nstep in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him\nthat if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was\nnot any harm meant, and that I am much obliged\nto him for picking up my books.\u201d\n\u201cYou make too much of a tri\ufb02e,\u201d said I. \u201cMay I\nask how you knew who I was?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, if it isn\u2019t too great a liberty, I am a\nneighbour of yours, for you\u2019ll \ufb01nd my little book-\nshop at the corner of Church Street, and very\nhappy to see you, I am sure.

With\n420\nThe Adventure of the Empty House\n\ufb01ve volumes you could just \ufb01ll that gap on that\nsecond shelf. It looks untidy, does it not, sir?\u201d\nI moved my head to look at the cabinet behind\nme. When I turned again Sherlock Holmes was\nstanding smiling at me across my study table. I\nrose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in\nutter amazement, and then it appears that I must\nhave fainted for the \ufb01rst and the last time in my\nlife. Certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes,\nand when it cleared I found my collar-ends un-\ndone and the tingling after-taste of brandy upon\nmy lips. Holmes was bending over my chair, his\n\ufb02ask in his hand. \u201cMy dear Watson,\u201d said the well-remembered\nvoice, \u201cI owe you a thousand apologies. I had no\nidea that you would be so affected.\u201d\nI gripped him by the arm. \u201cHolmes!\u201d I cried. \u201cIs it really you? Can it in-\ndeed be that you are alive? Is it possible that you\nsucceeded in climbing out of that awful abyss?\u201d\n\u201cWait a moment,\u201d said he. \u201cAre you sure that\nyou are really \ufb01t to discuss things?"

Sit down and tell me how\nyou came alive out of that dreadful chasm.\u201d\nHe sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his\nold nonchalant manner.

My note to\nyou was absolutely genuine. I had little doubt that\nI had come to the end of my career when I per-\nceived the somewhat sinister \ufb01gure of the late Pro-\nfessor Moriarty standing upon the narrow path-\nway which led to safety. I read an inexorable pur-\npose in his grey eyes. I exchanged some remarks\nwith him, therefore, and obtained his courteous\npermission to write the short note which you af-\nterwards received. I left it with my cigarette-box\nand my stick and I walked along the pathway, Mo-\nriarty still at my heels. When I reached the end I\nstood at bay. He drew no weapon, but he rushed at\nme and threw his long arms around me. He knew\nthat his own game was up, and was only anxious\nto revenge himself upon me. We tottered together\nupon the brink of the fall. I have some knowl-\nedge, however, of baritsu, or the Japanese system\nof wrestling, which has more than once been very\nuseful to me. I slipped through his grip, and he\nwith a horrible scream kicked madly for a few sec-\nonds and clawed the air with both his hands."

Then he struck a rock,\nbounded off, and splashed into the water.\u201d\nI listened with amazement to this explanation,\nwhich Holmes delivered between the puffs of his\ncigarette. \u201cBut the tracks!\u201d I cried. \u201cI saw with my own\neyes that two went down the path and none re-\nturned.\u201d\n\u201cIt came about in this way. The instant that the\nProfessor had disappeared it struck me what a re-\nally extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed\nin my way. I knew that Moriarty was not the only\nman who had sworn my death. There were at\nleast three others whose desire for vengeance upon\nme would only be increased by the death of their\nleader. They were all most dangerous men. One or\nother would certainly get me. On the other hand,\nif all the world was convinced that I was dead\nthey would take liberties, these men, they would\nlay themselves open, and sooner or later I could\ndestroy them. Then it would be time for me to\nannounce that I was still in the land of the living.

In your picturesque account of the mat-\nter, which I read with great interest some months\nlater, you assert that the wall was sheer. This was\nnot literally true. A few small footholds presented\nthemselves, and there was some indication of a\nledge. The cliff is so high that to climb it all was an\nobvious impossibility, and it was equally impossi-\nble to make my way along the wet path without\nleaving some tracks. I might, it is true, have re-\nversed my boots, as I have done on similar occa-\nsions, but the sight of three sets of tracks in one\ndirection would certainly have suggested a decep-\ntion. On the whole, then, it was best that I should\nrisk the climb. It was not a pleasant business, Wat-\nson. The fall roared beneath me. I am not a fanci-\nful person, but I give you my word that I seemed\nto hear Moriarty\u2019s voice screaming at me out of\nthe abyss. A mistake would have been fatal. More\nthan once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand\nor my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I\nthought that I was gone. But I struggled upwards,\nand at last I reached a ledge several feet deep and\ncovered with soft green moss, where I could lie\nunseen in the most perfect comfort. There I was\nstretched when you, my dear Watson, and all your\nfollowing were investigating in the most sympa-\nthetic and inef\ufb01cient manner the circumstances of\nmy death."

I had\nimagined that I had reached the end of my adven-\ntures, but a very unexpected occurrence showed\nme that there were surprises still in store for me. A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me,\nstruck the path, and bounded over into the chasm. For an instant I thought that it was an accident;\nbut a moment later, looking up, I saw a man\u2019s\nhead against the darkening sky, and another stone\nstruck the very ledge upon which I was stretched,\nwithin a foot of my head. Of course, the mean-\ning of this was obvious. Moriarty had not been\nalone. A confederate\u2014and even that one glance\nhad told me how dangerous a man that confeder-\nate was\u2014had kept guard while the Professor had\nattacked me. From a distance, unseen by me, he\nhad been a witness of his friend\u2019s death and of my\nescape. He had waited, and then, making his way\nround to the top of the cliff, he had endeavoured\nto succeed where his comrade had failed. \u201cI did not take long to think about it, Watson. Again I saw that grim face look over the cliff, and\nI knew that it was the precursor of another stone. I scrambled down on to the path. I don\u2019t think I\ncould have done it in cold blood. It was a hundred\ntimes more dif\ufb01cult than getting up. But I had\nno time to think of the danger, for another stone\nsang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge\nof the ledge. Halfway down I slipped, but by the\nblessing of God I landed, torn and bleeding, upon\nthe path. I took to my heels, did ten miles over\nthe mountains in the darkness, and a week later I\nfound myself in Florence with the certainty that no\none in the world knew what had become of me. \u201cI had only one con\ufb01dant\u2014my brother My-\ncroft.

Several times during the last three years I\nhave taken up my pen to write to you, but always I\nfeared lest your affectionate regard for me should\ntempt you to some indiscretion which would be-\ntray my secret. For that reason I turned away\nfrom you this evening when you upset my books,\nfor I was in danger at the time, and any show of\nsurprise and emotion upon your part might have\ndrawn attention to my identity and led to the most\ndeplorable and irreparable results.

As the gleam of the street-lamps \ufb02ashed upon his\naustere features I saw that his brows were drawn\ndown in thought and his thin lips compressed. I\nknew not what wild beast we were about to hunt\ndown in the dark jungle of criminal London, but\nI was well assured from the bearing of this mas-\nter huntsman that the adventure was a most grave\none, while the sardonic smile which occasionally\nbroke through his ascetic gloom boded little good\nfor the object of our quest. I had imagined that we were bound for Baker\nStreet, but Holmes stopped the cab at the cor-\nner of Cavendish Square. I observed that as he\nstepped out he gave a most searching glance to\nright and left, and at every subsequent street cor-\nner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was\nnot followed. Our route was certainly a singular\none. Holmes\u2019s knowledge of the byways of Lon-\ndon was extraordinary, and on this occasion he\npassed rapidly, and with an assured step, through\na network of mews and stables the very existence\nof which I had never known. We emerged at last\ninto a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses,\nwhich led us into Manchester Street, and so to\nBlandford Street. Here he turned swiftly down\na narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate\ninto a deserted yard, and then opened with a key\nthe back door of a house. We entered together and\nhe closed it behind us. The place was pitch-dark, but it was evident to\nme that it was an empty house. Our feet creaked\nand crackled over the bare planking, and my out-\nstretched hand touched a wall from which the pa-\nper was hanging in ribbons. Holmes\u2019s cold, thin\n\ufb01ngers closed round my wrist and led me for-\nwards down a long hall, until I dimly saw the\nmurky fanlight over the door. Here Holmes turned\nsuddenly to the right, and we found ourselves in\na large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in\nthe corners, but faintly lit in the centre from the\nlights of the street beyond. There was no lamp\nnear and the window was thick with dust, so that\nwe could only just discern each other\u2019s \ufb01gures\nwithin. My companion put his hand upon my\nshoulder and his lips close to my ear. \u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d he whispered. \u201cSurely that is Baker Street,\u201d I answered, star-\ning through the dim window. \u201cExactly. We are in Camden House, which\nstands opposite to our own old quarters.\u201d\n\u201cBut why are we here?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it commands so excellent a view of\nthat picturesque pile. Might I trouble you, my\ndear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window,\ntaking every precaution not to show yourself, and\nthen to look up at our old rooms\u2014the starting-\npoint of so many of our little adventures? We will\nsee if my three years of absence have entirely taken\naway my power to surprise you.\u201d\nI crept forward and looked across at the famil-\niar window."

The\nshadow of a man who was seated in a chair within\nwas thrown in hard, black outline upon the lumi-\nnous screen of the window. There was no mistak-\ning the poise of the head, the squareness of the\nshoulders, the sharpness of the features. The face\nwas turned half-round, and the effect was that of\none of those black silhouettes which our grand-\nparents loved to frame. It was a perfect reproduc-\ntion of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out\nmy hand to make sure that the man himself was\nstanding beside me. He was quivering with silent\nlaughter. \u201cWell?\u201d said he. \u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cIt is marvellous.\u201d\n\u201cI trust that age doth not wither nor custom\nstale my in\ufb01nite variety,\u2019\u201d said he, and I recognised\nin his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes\n423\nThe Adventure of the Empty House\nin his own creation. \u201cIt really is rather like me, is\nit not?\u201d\n\u201cI should be prepared to swear that it was\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cThe credit of the execution is due to Monsieur\nOscar Meunier, of Grenoble, who spent some days\nin doing the moulding. It is a bust in wax. The rest\nI arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street\nthis afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause, my dear Watson, I had the strongest\npossible reason for wishing certain people to think\nthat I was there when I was really elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you thought the rooms were watched?\u201d\n\u201cI knew that they were watched.\u201d\n\u201cBy whom?\u201d\n\u201cBy my old enemies, Watson. By the charming\nsociety whose leader lies in the Reichenbach Fall. You must remember that they knew, and only they\nknew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they be-\nlieved that I should come back to my rooms. They\nwatched them continuously, and this morning they\nsaw me arrive.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I recognised their sentinel when I\nglanced out of my window. He is a harmless\nenough fellow, Parker by name, a garroter by\ntrade, and a remarkable performer upon the Jew\u2019s\nharp. I cared nothing for him. But I cared a great\ndeal for the much more formidable person who\nwas behind him, the bosom friend of Moriarty, the\nman who dropped the rocks over the cliff, the most\ncunning and dangerous criminal in London. That\nis the man who is after me to-night, Watson, and\nthat is the man who is quite unaware that we are\nafter him.\u201d\nMy friend\u2019s plans were gradually revealing\nthemselves. From this convenient retreat the\nwatchers were being watched and the trackers\ntracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the\nbait and we were the hunters. In silence we stood\ntogether in the darkness and watched the hurry-\ning \ufb01gures who passed and repassed in front of\nus. Holmes was silent and motionless; but I could\ntell that he was keenly alert, and that his eyes were\n\ufb01xed intently upon the stream of passers-by."

Many peo-\nple were moving to and fro, most of them muf\ufb02ed\nin their coats and cravats. Once or twice it seemed\nto me that I had seen the same \ufb01gure before, and\nI especially noticed two men who appeared to be\nsheltering themselves from the wind in the door-\nway of a house some distance up the street. I tried\nto draw my companion\u2019s attention to them, but he\ngave a little ejaculation of impatience and contin-\nued to stare into the street. More than once he\n\ufb01dgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his\n\ufb01ngers upon the wall. It was evident to me that he\nwas becoming uneasy and that his plans were not\nworking out altogether as he had hoped. At last,\nas midnight approached and the street gradually\ncleared, he paced up and down the room in un-\ncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some\nremark to him when I raised my eyes to the lighted\nwindow and again experienced almost as great a\nsurprise as before. I clutched Holmes\u2019s arm and\npointed upwards. \u201cThe shadow has moved!\u201d I cried. It was, indeed, no longer the pro\ufb01le, but the\nback, which was turned towards us. Three years had certainly not smoothed the as-\nperities of his temper or his impatience with a less\nactive intelligence than his own. \u201cOf course it has moved,\u201d said he. \u201cAm I\nsuch a farcical bungler, Watson, that I should erect\nan obvious dummy and expect that some of the\nsharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it? We have been in this room two hours, and Mrs.\nHudson has made some change in that \ufb01gure eight\ntimes, or once in every quarter of an hour. She\nworks it from the front so that her shadow may\nnever be seen. Ah!\u201d He drew in his breath with\na shrill, excited intake. In the dim light I saw\nhis head thrown forward, his whole attitude rigid\nwith attention. Outside, the street was absolutely\ndeserted. Those two men might still be crouching\nin the doorway, but I could no longer see them. All\nwas still and dark, save only that brilliant yellow\nscreen in front of us with the black \ufb01gure outlined\nupon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard\nthat thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense sup-\npressed excitement. An instant later he pulled me\nback into the blackest corner of the room, and I felt\nhis warning hand upon my lips. The \ufb01ngers which\nclutched me were quivering. Never had I known\nmy friend more moved, and yet the dark street still\nstretched lonely and motionless before us. But suddenly I was aware of that which his\nkeener senses had already distinguished. A low,\nstealthy sound came to my ears, not from the di-\nrection of Baker Street, but from the back of the\nvery house in which we lay concealed."

An instant later steps crept\ndown the passage\u2014steps which were meant to be\nsilent, but which reverberated harshly through the\n424\nThe Adventure of the Empty House\nempty house. Holmes crouched back against the\nwall and I did the same, my hand closing upon the\nhandle of my revolver. Peering through the gloom,\nI saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker\nthan the blackness of the open door. He stood\nfor an instant, and then he crept forward, crouch-\ning, menacing, into the room. He was within three\nyards of us, this sinister \ufb01gure, and I had braced\nmyself to meet his spring, before I realized that he\nhad no idea of our presence. He passed close be-\nside us, stole over to the window, and very softly\nand noiselessly raised it for half a foot. As he sank\nto the level of this opening the light of the street, no\nlonger dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon\nhis face. The man seemed to be beside himself\nwith excitement. His two eyes shone like stars\nand his features were working convulsively. He\nwas an elderly man, with a thin, projecting nose,\na high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled mous-\ntache. An opera-hat was pushed to the back of\nhis head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed\nout through his open overcoat. His face was gaunt\nand swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his\nhand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but\nas he laid it down upon the \ufb02oor it gave a metal-\nlic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he\ndrew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some\ntask which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a\nspring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still kneel-\ning upon the \ufb02oor he bent forward and threw all\nhis weight and strength upon some lever, with the\nresult that there came a long, whirling, grinding\nnoise, ending once more in a powerful click. He\nstraightened himself then, and I saw that what he\nheld in his hand was a sort of gun, with a curi-\nously misshapen butt. He opened it at the breech,\nput something in, and snapped the breech-block. Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the\nbarrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I\nsaw his long moustache droop over the stock and\nhis eye gleam as it peered along the sights. I heard\na little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt\ninto his shoulder, and saw that amazing target, the\nblack man on the yellow ground, standing clear at\nthe end of his fore sight. For an instant he was\nrigid and motionless. Then his \ufb01nger tightened on\nthe trigger. There was a strange, loud whiz and a\nlong, silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant\nHolmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman\u2019s\nback and hurled him \ufb02at upon his face."

I fell upon him,\nand as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call\nupon a whistle. There was the clatter of running\nfeet upon the pavement, and two policemen in\nuniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed\nthrough the front entrance and into the room. \u201cThat you, Lestrade?\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It\u2019s\ngood to see you back in London, sir.\u201d\n\u201cI think you want a little unof\ufb01cial help. Three undetected murders in one year won\u2019t do,\nLestrade. But you handled the Molesey Mystery\nwith less than your usual\u2014that\u2019s to say, you han-\ndled it fairly well.\u201d\nWe had all risen to our feet, our prisoner\nbreathing hard, with a stalwart constable on each\nside of him. Already a few loiterers had begun to\ncollect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the win-\ndow, closed it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade\nhad produced two candles and the policemen had\nuncovered their lanterns. I was able at last to have\na good look at our prisoner. It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister\nface which was turned towards us. With the brow\nof a philosopher above and the jaw of a sensualist\nbelow, the man must have started with great ca-\npacities for good or for evil. But one could not look\nupon his cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cyn-\nical lids, or upon the \ufb01erce, aggressive nose and\nthe threatening, deep-lined brow, without read-\ning Nature\u2019s plainest danger-signals. He took no\nheed of any of us, but his eyes were \ufb01xed upon\nHolmes\u2019s face with an expression in which ha-\ntred and amazement were equally blended. \u201cYou\n\ufb01end!\u201d he kept on muttering. \u201cYou clever, clever\n\ufb01end!\u201d\n\u201cAh, Colonel!\u201d said Holmes, arranging his\nrumpled collar; \u201c \u2018journeys end in lovers\u2019 meet-\nings,\u2019 as the old play says. I don\u2019t think I have had\nthe pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me\nwith those attentions as I lay on the ledge above\nthe Reichenbach Fall.\u201d\nThe Colonel still stared at my friend like a man\nin a trance. \u201cYou cunning, cunning \ufb01end!\u201d was all\nthat he could say. \u201cI have not introduced you yet,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis, gentlemen, is Colonel Sebastian Moran,\nonce of Her Majesty\u2019s Indian Army, and the best\nheavy game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever\nproduced. I believe I am correct, Colonel, in saying\nthat your bag of tigers still remains unrivalled?\u201d\nThe \ufb01erce old man said nothing, but still\nglared at my companion; with his savage eyes\nand bristling moustache he was wonderfully like\na tiger himself. 425\nThe Adventure of the Empty House\n\u201cI wonder that my very simple stratagem could\ndeceive so old a shikari,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt must\nbe very familiar to you.

He was always a man of\niron nerve, and the story is still told in India how\nhe crawled down a drain after a wounded man-\neating tiger. There are some trees, Watson, which\ngrow to a certain height and then suddenly de-\nvelop some unsightly eccentricity. You will see it\noften in humans. I have a theory that the individ-\nual represents in his development the whole pro-\ncession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden\nturn to good or evil stands for some strong in\ufb02u-\nence which came into the line of his pedigree. The\nperson becomes, as it were, the epitome of the his-\ntory of his own family.\u201d\n\u201cIt is surely rather fanciful.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t insist upon it. Whatever the\ncause, Colonel Moran began to go wrong. With-\nout any open scandal he still made India too hot to\nhold him. He retired, came to London, and again\nacquired an evil name. It was at this time that he\nwas sought out by Professor Moriarty, to whom for\na time he was chief of the staff. Moriarty supplied\nhim liberally with money and used him only in\none or two very high-class jobs which no ordinary\ncriminal could have undertaken. You may have\nsome recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of\nLauder, in 1887. Not? Well, I am sure Moran was\nat the bottom of it; but nothing could be proved. So cleverly was the Colonel concealed that even\nwhen the Moriarty gang was broken up we could\nnot incriminate him. You remember at that date,\nwhen I called upon you in your rooms, how I put\nup the shutters for fear of air-guns? No doubt you\nthought me fanciful. I knew exactly what I was\ndoing, for I knew of the existence of this remark-\nable gun, and I knew also that one of the best shots\nin the world would be behind it. When we were\nin Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty, and\nit was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil \ufb01ve\nminutes on the Reichenbach ledge. \u201cYou may think that I read the papers with\nsome attention during my sojourn in France, on\nthe look-out for any chance of laying him by the\nheels. So long as he was free in London my life\nwould really not have been worth living."

I could not shoot him at sight,\nor I should myself be in the dock. There was no\nuse appealing to a magistrate. They cannot inter-\nfere on the strength of what would appear to them\nto be a wild suspicion. So I could do nothing. But\nI watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner\nor later I should get him. Then came the death\nof this Ronald Adair. My chance had come at\nlast! Knowing what I did, was it not certain that\n427\nColonel Moran had done it? He had played cards\nwith the lad; he had followed him home from the\nclub; he had shot him through the open window. There was not a doubt of it. The bullets alone are\nenough to put his head in a noose. I came over\nat once. I was seen by the sentinel, who would,\nI knew, direct the Colonel\u2019s attention to my pres-\nence. He could not fail to connect my sudden re-\nturn with his crime and to be terribly alarmed. I\nwas sure that he would make an attempt to get\nme out of the way at once, and would bring round\nhis murderous weapon for that purpose. I left\nhim an excellent mark in the window, and, having\nwarned the police that they might be needed\u2014by\nthe way, Watson, you spotted their presence in that\ndoorway with unerring accuracy\u2014I took up what\nseemed to me to be a judicious post for observa-\ntion, never dreaming that he would choose the\nsame spot for his attack. Now, my dear Watson,\ndoes anything remain for me to explain?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said I. \u201cYou have not made it clear what\nwas Colonel Moran\u2019s motive in murdering the\nHonourable Ronald Adair.\u201d\n\u201cAh! my dear Watson, there we come into\nthose realms of conjecture where the most logical\nmind may be at fault. Each may form his own hy-\npothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is\nas likely to be correct as mine.\u201d\n\u201cYou have formed one, then?\u201d\n\u201cI think that it is not dif\ufb01cult to explain the\nfacts. It came out in evidence that Colonel Moran\nand young Adair had between them won a consid-\nerable amount of money. Now, Moran undoubt-\nedly played foul\u2014of that I have long been aware. I believe that on the day of the murder Adair had\ndiscovered that Moran was cheating. Very likely\nhe had spoken to him privately, and had threat-\nened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned\nhis membership of the club and promised not to\nplay cards again. It is unlikely that a youngster\nlike Adair would at once make a hideous scandal\nby exposing a well-known man so much older than\nhimself. Probably he acted as I suggest. The exclu-\nsion from his clubs would mean ruin to Moran,\nwho lived by his ill-gotten card gains."

Meanwhile, come what may, Colonel Moran will\ntrouble us no more, the famous air-gun of Von\nHerder will embellish the Scotland Yard Museum,\nand once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to\ndevote his life to examining those interesting lit-\ntle problems which the complex life of London so\nplentifully presents.\u201d\nThe Adventure of the Norwood Builder\nThe Adventure of the Norwood Builder\nF\nrom the point of view of the crimi-\nnal expert,\u201d said Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\n\u201cLondon has become a singularly unin-\nteresting city since the death of the late\nlamented Professor Moriarty.\u201d\n\u201cI can hardly think that you would \ufb01nd many\ndecent citizens to agree with you,\u201d I answered. \u201cWell, well, I must not be sel\ufb01sh,\u201d said he,\nwith a smile, as he pushed back his chair from the\nbreakfast-table. \u201cThe community is certainly the\ngainer, and no one the loser, save the poor out-of-\nwork specialist, whose occupation has gone. With\nthat man in the \ufb01eld one\u2019s morning paper pre-\nsented in\ufb01nite possibilities. Often it was only the\nsmallest trace, Watson, the faintest indication, and\nyet it was enough to tell me that the great malig-\nnant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of the\nedges of the web remind one of the foul spider\nwhich lurks in the centre. Petty thefts, wanton as-\nsaults, purposeless outrage\u2014to the man who held\nthe clue all could be worked into one connected\nwhole. To the scienti\ufb01c student of the higher crim-\ninal world no capital in Europe offered the advan-\ntages which London then possessed. But now\u2014\u201d\nHe shrugged his shoulders in humorous depreca-\ntion of the state of things which he had himself\ndone so much to produce. At the time of which I speak Holmes had been\nback for some months, and I, at his request, had\nsold my practice and returned to share the old\nquarters in Baker Street. A young doctor, named\nVerner, had purchased my small Kensington prac-\ntice, and given with astonishingly little demur\nthe highest price that I ventured to ask\u2014an inci-\ndent which only explained itself some years later\nwhen I found that Verner was a distant relation\nof Holmes\u2019s, and that it was my friend who had\nreally found the money. Our months of partnership had not been so un-\neventful as he had stated, for I \ufb01nd, on looking\nover my notes, that this period includes the case\nof the papers of Ex-President Murillo, and also the\nshocking affair of the Dutch steamship Friesland,\nwhich so nearly cost us both our lives."

He was \ufb02axen-haired and handsome in a\nwashed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue\neyes and a clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensi-\ntive mouth.

Mr.\nJonas Oldacre is a well-known resident of\nthat suburb, where he has carried on his\nbusiness as a builder for many years. Mr.\nOldacre is a bachelor, \ufb01fty-two years of\nage, and lives in Deep Dene House, at the\nSydenham end of the road of that name. He has had the reputation of being a man\nof eccentric habits, secretive and retiring. For some years he has practically with-\ndrawn from the business, in which he is\nsaid to have amassed considerable wealth. A small timber-yard still exists, however,\nat the back of the house, and last night,\nabout twelve o\u2019clock, an alarm was given\nthat one of the stacks was on \ufb01re. The en-\ngines were soon upon the spot, but the dry\nwood burned with great fury, and it was\nimpossible to arrest the con\ufb02agration un-\ntil the stack had been entirely consumed."

Surprise was expressed at the absence of\nthe master of the establishment from the\nscene of the \ufb01re, and an inquiry followed,\nwhich showed that he had disappeared from\nthe house. An examination of his room re-\nvealed that the bed had not been slept in,\nthat a safe which stood in it was open, that a\nnumber of important papers were scattered\nabout the room, and, \ufb01nally, that there were\nsigns of a murderous struggle, slight traces\nof blood being found within the room, and\nan oaken walking-stick, which also showed\nstains of blood upon the handle. It is known\nthat Mr. Jonas Oldacre had received a late\nvisitor in his bedroom upon that night, and\nthe stick found has been identi\ufb01ed as the\nproperty of this person, who is a young\nLondon solicitor named John Hector Mc-\nFarlane, junior partner of Graham and Mc-\nFarlane, of 426, Gresham Buildings, E.C.

It is at\nleast certain that a warrant has been issued. There have been further and sinister devel-\nopments in the investigation at Norwood. Besides the signs of a struggle in the room\nof the unfortunate builder it is now known\nthat the French windows of his bedroom\n(which is on the ground \ufb02oor) were found\nto be open, that there were marks as if some\nbulky object had been dragged across to the\nwood-pile, and, \ufb01nally, it is asserted that\ncharred remains have been found among the\ncharcoal ashes of the \ufb01re. The police theory\n432\nThe Adventure of the Norwood Builder\nis that a most sensational crime has been\ncommitted, that the victim was clubbed to\ndeath in his own bedroom, his papers ri-\n\ufb02ed, and his dead body dragged across to\nthe wood-stack, which was then ignited so\nas to hide all traces of the crime.

He had in his hand several sheets of a note-\nbook, covered with scribbled writing\u2014here they\nare\u2014and he laid them on my table. \u201c \u2018Here is my will,\u2019 said he. \u2018I want you, Mr.\nMcFarlane, to cast it into proper legal shape.

It may do something to simplify\nwhat followed. No, my dear fellow, I don\u2019t think\nyou can help me. There is no prospect of dan-\nger, or I should not dream of stirring out without\nyou. I trust that when I see you in the evening I\nwill be able to report that I have been able to do\n435\nThe Adventure of the Norwood Builder\nsomething for this unfortunate youngster who has\nthrown himself upon my protection.\u201d\nIt was late when my friend returned, and I\ncould see by a glance at his haggard and anxious\nface that the high hopes with which he had started\nhad not been ful\ufb01lled. For an hour he droned away\nupon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own\nruf\ufb02ed spirits. At last he \ufb02ung down the instru-\nment and plunged into a detailed account of his\nmisadventures. \u201cIt\u2019s all going wrong, Watson\u2014all as wrong as\nit can go. I kept a bold face before Lestrade, but,\nupon my soul, I believe that for once the fellow is\non the right track and we are on the wrong. All my\ninstincts are one way and all the facts are the other,\nand I much fear that British juries have not yet\nattained that pitch of intelligence when they will\ngive the preference to my theories over Lestrade\u2019s\nfacts.\u201d\n\u201cDid you go to Blackheath?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Watson, I went there, and I found very\nquickly that the late lamented Oldacre was a pretty\nconsiderable black-guard."

Of course, she would not admit\neven the possibility of his guilt. But she would not\nexpress either surprise or regret over the fate of\nOldacre. On the contrary, she spoke of him with\nsuch bitterness that she was unconsciously consid-\nerably strengthening the case of the police, for, of\ncourse, if her son had heard her speak of the man\nin this fashion it would predispose him towards\nhatred and violence. \u2018He was more like a malig-\nnant and cunning ape than a human being,\u2019 said\nshe, \u2018and he always was, ever since he was a young\nman.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You knew him at that time?\u2019 said I. \u201c \u2018Yes, I knew him well; in fact, he was an old\nsuitor of mine. Thank Heaven that I had the sense\nto turn away from him and to marry a better, if a\npoorer, man. I was engaged to him, Mr. Holmes,\nwhen I heard a shocking story of how he had\nturned a cat loose in an aviary, and I was so horri-\n\ufb01ed at his brutal cruelty that I would have nothing\nmore to do with him.\u2019\nShe rummaged in a bu-\nreau, and presently she produced a photograph of\na woman, shamefully defaced and mutilated with\na knife. \u2018That is my own photograph,\u2019 she said. \u2018He sent it to me in that state, with his curse, upon\nmy wedding morning.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018at least he has forgiven you\nnow, since he has left all his property to your son.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Neither my son nor I want anything from\nJonas Oldacre, dead or alive,\u2019 she cried, with a\nproper spirit. \u2018There is a God in Heaven, Mr.\nHolmes, and that same God who has punished\nthat wicked man will show in His own good time\nthat my son\u2019s hands are guiltless of his blood.\u2019\n\u201cWell, I tried one or two leads, but could get\nat nothing which would help our hypothesis, and\nseveral points which would make against it. I gave\nit up at last and off I went to Norwood. \u201cThis place, Deep Dene House, is a big mod-\nern villa of staring brick, standing back in its own\ngrounds, with a laurel-clumped lawn in front of it. To the right and some distance back from the road\nwas the timber-yard which had been the scene of\nthe \ufb01re. Here\u2019s a rough plan on a leaf of my\nnote-book. This window on the left is the one\nwhich opens into Oldacre\u2019s room. You can look\ninto it from the road, you see. That is about the\nonly bit of consolation I have had to-day. Lestrade\nwas not there, but his head constable did the hon-\nours. They had just made a great treasure-trove. They had spent the morning raking among the\nashes of the burned wood-pile, and besides the\ncharred organic remains they had secured sev-\neral discoloured metal discs."

I even distinguished that one of\nthem was marked with the name of \u2018Hyams,\u2019 who\nwas Oldacre\u2019s tailor. I then worked the lawn very\ncarefully for signs and traces, but this drought has\nmade everything as hard as iron. Nothing was to\nbe seen save that some body or bundle had been\ndragged through a low privet hedge which is in a\nline with the wood-pile. All that, of course, \ufb01ts in\nwith the of\ufb01cial theory. I crawled about the lawn\nwith an August sun on my back, but I got up at\nthe end of an hour no wiser than before. \u201cWell, after this \ufb01asco I went into the bedroom\nand examined that also. The blood-stains were\nvery slight, mere smears and discolorations, but\nundoubtedly fresh. The stick had been removed,\nbut there also the marks were slight. There is no\ndoubt about the stick belonging to our client. He\nadmits it. Footmarks of both men could be made\nout on the carpet, but none of any third person,\nwhich again is a trick for the other side. They were\npiling up their score all the time and we were at a\nstandstill. \u201cOnly one little gleam of hope did I get\u2014and\nyet it amounted to nothing. I examined the con-\ntents of the safe, most of which had been taken out\nand left on the table. The papers had been made\nup into sealed envelopes, one or two of which had\n436\nThe Adventure of the Norwood Builder\nbeen opened by the police. They were not, so far\nas I could judge, of any great value, nor did the\nbank-book show that Mr. Oldacre was in such very\naf\ufb02uent circumstances. But it seemed to me that all\nthe papers were not there. There were allusions to\nsome deeds\u2014possibly the more valuable\u2014which\nI could not \ufb01nd. This, of course, if we could def-\ninitely prove it, would turn Lestrade\u2019s argument\nagainst himself, for who would steal a thing if he\nknew that he would shortly inherit it? \u201cFinally, having drawn every other cover and\npicked up no scent, I tried my luck with the house-\nkeeper. Mrs. Lexington is her name, a little, dark,\nsilent person, with suspicious and sidelong eyes. She could tell us something if she would\u2014I am\nconvinced of it. But she was as close as wax. Yes, she had let Mr. McFarlane in at half-past nine. She wished her hand had withered before she had\ndone so. She had gone to bed at half-past ten. Her\nroom was at the other end of the house, and she\ncould hear nothing of what passed. Mr. McFar-\nlane had left his hat, and to the best of her belief\nhis stick, in the hall. She had been awakened by\nthe alarm of \ufb01re. Her poor, dear master had cer-\ntainly been murdered. Had he any enemies? Well,\nevery man had enemies, but Mr. Oldacre kept him-\nself very much to himself, and only met people in\nthe way of business."

She knew nothing of the papers, nor of Mr.\nOldacre\u2019s private affairs. \u201cSo, my dear Watson, there\u2019s my report of a\nfailure.

However, there\u2019s no good talking any more about\nit, Watson; but unless some lucky chance comes\nour way I fear that the Norwood Disappearance\nCase will not \ufb01gure in that chronicle of our suc-\ncesses which I foresee that a patient public will\nsooner or later have to endure.\u201d\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said I, \u201cthe man\u2019s appearance would\ngo far with any jury?\u201d\n\u201cThat is a dangerous argument, my dear Wat-\nson. You remember that terrible murderer, Bert\nStevens, who wanted us to get him off in \u201987? Was\nthere ever a more mild-mannered, Sunday-school\nyoung man?\u201d\n\u201cIt is true.\u201d\n\u201cUnless we succeed in establishing an alter-\nnative theory this man is lost. You can hardly\n\ufb01nd a \ufb02aw in the case which can now be pre-\nsented against him, and all further investigation\nhas served to strengthen it. By the way, there is\none curious little point about those papers which\nmay serve us as the starting-point for an inquiry. On looking over the bank-book I found that the\nlow state of the balance was principally due to\nlarge cheques which have been made out during\nthe last year to Mr. Cornelius. I confess that I\nshould be interested to know who this Mr. Cor-\nnelius may be with whom a retired builder has\nsuch very large transactions. Is it possible that he\nhas had a hand in the affair? Cornelius might be a\nbroker, but we have found no scrip to correspond\nwith these large payments. Failing any other indi-\ncation my researches must now take the direction\nof an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who\nhas cashed these cheques. But I fear, my dear fel-\nlow, that our case will end ingloriously by Lestrade\nhanging our client, which will certainly be a tri-\numph for Scotland Yard.\u201d\nI do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took\nany sleep that night, but when I came down to\nbreakfast I found him pale and harassed, his bright\neyes the brighter for the dark shadows round\nthem. The carpet round his chair was littered with\ncigarette-ends and with the early editions of the\nmorning papers.

After\nall, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing,\nand may possibly cut in a very different direction\nto that which Lestrade imagines. Take your break-\nfast, Watson, and we will go out together and see\nwhat we can do. I feel as if I shall need your com-\npany and your moral support to-day.\u201d\n437\nThe Adventure of the Norwood Builder\nMy friend had no breakfast himself, for it was\none of his peculiarities that in his more intense mo-\nments he would permit himself no food, and I have\nknown him presume upon his iron strength until\nhe has fainted from pure inanition. \u201cAt present\nI cannot spare energy and nerve force for diges-\ntion,\u201d he would say in answer to my medical re-\nmonstrances. I was not surprised, therefore, when\nthis morning he left his untouched meal behind\nhim and started with me for Norwood. A crowd\nof morbid sightseers were still gathered round\nDeep Dene House, which was just such a suburban\nvilla as I had pictured. Within the gates Lestrade\nmet us, his face \ufb02ushed with victory, his manner\ngrossly triumphant. \u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be\nwrong yet? Have you found your tramp?\u201d he\ncried. \u201cI have formed no conclusion whatever,\u201d my\ncompanion answered. \u201cBut we formed ours yesterday, and now it\nproves to be correct; so you must acknowledge that\nwe have been a little in front of you this time, Mr.\nHolmes.\u201d\n\u201cYou certainly have the air of something un-\nusual having occurred,\u201d said Holmes. Lestrade laughed loudly. \u201cYou don\u2019t like being beaten any more than the\nrest of us do,\u201d said he. \u201cA man can\u2019t expect always\nto have it his own way, can he, Dr. Watson? Step\nthis way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I\ncan convince you once for all that it was John Mc-\nFarlane who did this crime.\u201d\nHe led us through the passage and out into a\ndark hall beyond. \u201cThis is where young McFarlane must have\ncome out to get his hat after the crime was done,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cNow, look at this.\u201d With dramatic sud-\ndenness he struck a match and by its light exposed\na stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. As he\nheld the match nearer I saw that it was more than\na stain. It was the well-marked print of a thumb. \u201cLook at that with your magnifying glass, Mr.\nHolmes.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am doing so.\u201d\n\u201cYou are aware that no two thumb marks are\nalike?\u201d\n\u201cI have heard something of the kind.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, will you please compare that print\nwith this wax impression of young McFarlane\u2019s\nright thumb, taken by my orders this morning?\u201d\nAs he held the waxen print close to the blood-\nstain it did not take a magnifying glass to see that\nthe two were undoubtedly from the same thumb."

A few articles of furni-\nture and a supply of food and water were within,\ntogether with a number of books and papers. \u201cThere\u2019s the advantage of being a builder,\u201d said\nHolmes, as we came out. \u201cHe was able to \ufb01x up\nhis own little hiding-place without any confeder-\nate\u2014save, of course, that precious housekeeper of\nhis, whom I should lose no time in adding to your\nbag, Lestrade.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your advice. But how did you know\nof this place, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cI made up my mind that the fellow was in\nhiding in the house. When I paced one corridor\nand found it six feet shorter than the correspond-\ning one below, it was pretty clear where he was. I thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before\nan alarm of \ufb01re. We could, of course, have gone\nin and taken him, but it amused me to make him\nreveal himself; besides, I owed you a little mysti\ufb01-\ncation, Lestrade, for your chaff in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, you certainly got equal with me on\nthat. But how in the world did you know that he\nwas in the house at all?\u201d\n\u201cThe thumb-mark, Lestrade. You said it was \ufb01-\nnal; and so it was, in a very different sense. I knew\nit had not been there the day before. I pay a good\ndeal of attention to matters of detail, as you may\nhave observed, and I had examined the hall and\nwas sure that the wall was clear. Therefore, it had\nbeen put on during the night.\u201d\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n440\n\u201cVery simply. When those packets were sealed\nup, Jonas Oldacre got McFarlane to secure one of\nthe seals by putting his thumb upon the soft wax."

Brooding over the case in that den of his,\nit suddenly struck him what absolutely damning\nevidence he could make against McFarlane by us-\ning that thumb-mark. It was the simplest thing in\nthe world for him to take a wax impression from\nthe seal, to moisten it in as much blood as he could\nget from a pin-prick, and to put the mark upon the\nwall during the night, either with his own hand\nor with that of his housekeeper. If you examine\namong those documents which he took with him\ninto his retreat I will lay you a wager that you \ufb01nd\nthe seal with the thumb-mark upon it.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cWonderful! It\u2019s\nall as clear as crystal, as you put it. But what is the\nobject of this deep deception, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\nIt was amusing to me to see how the detective\u2019s\noverbearing manner had changed suddenly to that\nof a child asking questions of its teacher. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that is very hard to ex-\nplain. A very deep, malicious, vindictive person\nis the gentleman who is now awaiting us down-\nstairs. You know that he was once refused by\nMcFarlane\u2019s mother? You don\u2019t! I told you that\nyou should go to Blackheath \ufb01rst and Norwood\nafterwards. Well, this injury, as he would con-\nsider it, has rankled in his wicked, scheming brain,\nand all his life he has longed for vengeance, but\nnever seen his chance. During the last year or two\nthings have gone against him\u2014secret speculation,\nI think\u2014and he \ufb01nds himself in a bad way. He de-\ntermines to swindle his creditors, and for this pur-\npose he pays large cheques to a certain Mr. Cor-\nnelius, who is, I imagine, himself under another\nname. I have not traced these cheques yet, but I\nhave no doubt that they were banked under that\nname at some provincial town where Oldacre from\ntime to time led a double existence. He intended\nto change his name altogether, draw this money,\nand vanish, starting life again elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s likely enough.\u201d\n\u201cIt would strike him that in disappearing he\nmight throw all pursuit off his track, and at the\nsame time have an ample and crushing revenge\nupon his old sweetheart, if he could give the im-\npression that he had been murdered by her only\nchild. It was a masterpiece of villainy, and he car-\nried it out like a master. The idea of the will, which\nwould give an obvious motive for the crime, the\nsecret visit unknown to his own parents, the re-\ntention of the stick, the blood, and the animal re-\nmains and buttons in the wood-pile, all were ad-\nmirable. It was a net from which it seemed to\nme a few hours ago that there was no possible es-\ncape."

I\u2019ll begin at the time of my mar-\nriage last year; but I want to say \ufb01rst of all that,\nthough I\u2019m not a rich man, my people have been\nat Ridling Thorpe for a matter of \ufb01ve centuries,\nand there is no better known family in the County\nof Norfolk. Last year I came up to London for the\nJubilee, and I stopped at a boarding-house in Rus-\nsell Square, because Parker, the vicar of our parish,\nwas staying in it. There was an American young\nlady there\u2014Patrick was the name\u2014Elsie Patrick. In some way we became friends, until before my\nmonth was up I was as much in love as a man\ncould be. We were quietly married at a registry\nof\ufb01ce, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded cou-\nple. You\u2019ll think it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a\nman of a good old family should marry a wife in\nthis fashion, knowing nothing of her past or of her\npeople; but if you saw her and knew her it would\nhelp you to understand. \u201cShe was very straight about it, was Elsie. I\ncan\u2019t say that she did not give me every chance of\ngetting out of it if I wished to do so. \u2018I have had\nsome very disagreeable associations in my life,\u2019\nsaid she; \u2018I wish to forget all about them. I would\nrather never allude to the past, for it is very painful\nto me. If you take me, Hilton, you will take a\nwoman who has nothing that she need be person-\nally ashamed of; but you will have to be content\nwith my word for it, and to allow me to be silent\nas to all that passed up to the time when I became\nyours. If these conditions are too hard, then go\nback to Norfolk and leave me to the lonely life in\nwhich you found me.\u2019 It was only the day before\nour wedding that she said those very words to me."

She turned\ndeadly white, read the letter, and threw it into the\n\ufb01re. She made no allusion to it afterwards, and\nI made none, for a promise is a promise; but she\nhas never known an easy hour from that moment.

I had them washed out, and I only mentioned\nthe matter to my wife afterwards. To my sur-\nprise she took it very seriously, and begged me\nif any more came to let her see them. None did\ncome for a week, and then yesterday morning I\nfound this paper lying on the sun-dial in the gar-\nden. I showed it to Elsie, and down she dropped\nin a dead faint. Since then she has looked like a\nwoman in a dream, half dazed, and with terror al-\nways lurking in her eyes. It was then that I wrote\nand sent the paper to you, Mr. Holmes. It was\nnot a thing that I could take to the police, for they\nwould have laughed at me, but you will tell me\nwhat to do. I am not a rich man; but if there is\nany danger threatening my little woman I would\nspend my last copper to shield her.\u201d\nHe was a \ufb01ne creature, this man of the old En-\nglish soil, simple, straight, and gentle, with his\ngreat, earnest blue eyes and broad, comely face.

But there is a\ntone in my wife\u2019s voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look\nin her eyes which forbid doubt, and I am sure that\nit was indeed my own safety that was in her mind. There\u2019s the whole case, and now I want your ad-\nvice as to what I ought to do. My own inclination\nis to put half-a-dozen of my farm lads in the shrub-\nbery, and when this fellow comes again to give him\nsuch a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the\nfuture.\u201d\n\u201cI fear it is too deep a case for such simple\nremedies,\u201d said Holmes."

She is very ner-\nvous and begged me to come back.\u201d\n\u201cI dare say you are right. But if you could have\nstopped I might possibly have been able to return\nwith you in a day or two. Meanwhile you will\nleave me these papers, and I think that it is very\nlikely that I shall be able to pay you a visit shortly\nand to throw some light upon your case.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes preserved his calm profes-\nsional manner until our visitor had left us, al-\nthough it was easy for me, who knew him so well,\nto see that he was profoundly excited. The mo-\nment that Hilton Cubitt\u2019s broad back had disap-\npeared through the door my comrade rushed to\nthe table, laid out all the slips of paper contain-\ning dancing men in front of him, and threw him-\nself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For\ntwo hours I watched him as he covered sheet after\nsheet of paper with \ufb01gures and letters, so com-\npletely absorbed in his task that he had evidently\nforgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making\nprogress and whistled and sang at his work; some-\ntimes he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells\nwith a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he\nsprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction,\nand walked up and down the room rubbing his\nhands together. Then he wrote a long telegram\n448\nThe Adventure of the Dancing Men\nupon a cable form. \u201cIf my answer to this is as I\nhope, you will have a very pretty case to add to\nyour collection, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cI expect that\nwe shall be able to go down to Norfolk to-morrow,\nand to take our friend some very de\ufb01nite news as\nto the secret of his annoyance.\u201d\nI confess that I was \ufb01lled with curiosity, but I\nwas aware that Holmes liked to make his disclo-\nsures at his own time and in his own way; so I\nwaited until it should suit him to take me into his\ncon\ufb01dence. But there was a delay in that answering tele-\ngram, and two days of impatience followed, dur-\ning which Holmes pricked up his ears at every\nring of the bell. On the evening of the second\nthere came a letter from Hilton Cubitt. All was\nquiet with him, save that a long inscription had\nappeared that morning upon the pedestal of the\nsun-dial. He inclosed a copy of it, which is here\nreproduced:\u2014\nHolmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some\nminutes, and then suddenly sprang to his feet with\nan exclamation of surprise and dismay. His face\nwas haggard with anxiety. \u201cWe have let this affair go far enough,\u201d said he. \u201cIs there a train to North Walsham to-night?\u201d\nI turned up the time-table.

One moment, Mrs. Hudson;\nthere may be an answer. No, that is quite as I ex-\npected. This message makes it even more essential\nthat we should not lose an hour in letting Hilton\nCubitt know how matters stand, for it is a singular\nand a dangerous web in which our simple Norfolk\nsquire is entangled.\u201d\nSo, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the\ndark conclusion of a story which had seemed to\nme to be only childish and bizarre I experience\nonce again the dismay and horror with which I\nwas \ufb01lled. Would that I had some brighter end-\ning to communicate to my readers, but these are\nthe chronicles of fact, and I must follow to their\ndark crisis the strange chain of events which for\nsome days made Ridling Thorpe Manor a house-\nhold word through the length and breadth of Eng-\nland. We had hardly alighted at North Walsham, and\nmentioned the name of our destination, when the\nstation-master hurried towards us. \u201cI suppose that\nyou are the detectives from London?\u201d said he. A look of annoyance passed over Holmes\u2019s\nface. \u201cWhat makes you think such a thing?\u201d\n\u201cBecause Inspector Martin from Norwich has\njust passed through. But maybe you are the sur-\ngeons. She\u2019s not dead\u2014or wasn\u2019t by last accounts.

Dear, dear, one of the oldest families in the County\nof Norfolk, and one of the most honoured.\u201d\nWithout a word Holmes hurried to a carriage,\nand during the long seven miles\u2019 drive he never\nopened his mouth. Seldom have I seen him so ut-\nterly despondent. He had been uneasy during all\nour journey from town, and I had observed that\nhe had turned over the morning papers with anx-\nious attention; but now this sudden realization of\nhis worst fears left him in a blank melancholy. He\nleaned back in his seat, lost in gloomy speculation. Yet there was much around to interest us, for we\nwere passing through as singular a country-side\nas any in England, where a few scattered cottages\nrepresented the population of to-day, while on ev-\nery hand enormous square-towered churches bris-\ntled up from the \ufb02at, green landscape and told of\nthe glory and prosperity of old East Anglia. At last\nthe violet rim of the German Ocean appeared over\nthe green edge of the Norfolk coast, and the driver\npointed with his whip to two old brick and tim-\nber gables which projected from a grove of trees."

As we drove up to the porticoed front door I\nobserved in front of it, beside the tennis lawn, the\nblack tool-house and the pedestalled sun-dial with\nwhich we had such strange associations. A dapper\nlittle man, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed\nmoustache, had just descended from a high dog-\ncart. He introduced himself as Inspector Martin,\n449\nThe Adventure of the Dancing Men\nof the Norfolk Constabulary, and he was consid-\nerably astonished when he heard the name of my\ncompanion. \u201cWhy, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only com-\nmitted at three this morning. How could you hear\nof it in London and get to the spot as soon as I?\u201d\n\u201cI anticipated it. I came in the hope of prevent-\ning it.\u201d\n\u201cThen you must have important evidence of\nwhich we are ignorant, for they were said to be\na most united couple.\u201d\n\u201cI have only the evidence of the dancing men,\u201d\nsaid Holmes. \u201cI will explain the matter to you\nlater. Meanwhile, since it is too late to prevent\nthis tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use\nthe knowledge which I possess in order to ensure\nthat justice be done. Will you associate me in your\ninvestigation, or will you prefer that I should act\nindependently?\u201d\n\u201cI should be proud to feel that we were act-\ning together, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said the inspector,\nearnestly. \u201cIn that case I should be glad to hear the evi-\ndence and to examine the premises without an in-\nstant of unnecessary delay.\u201d\nInspector Martin had the good sense to allow\nmy friend to do things in his own fashion, and\ncontented himself with carefully noting the results. The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had\njust come down from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt\u2019s room,\nand he reported that her injuries were serious,\nbut not necessarily fatal. The bullet had passed\nthrough the front of her brain, and it would prob-\nably be some time before she could regain con-\nsciousness. On the question of whether she had\nbeen shot or had shot herself he would not ven-\nture to express any decided opinion. Certainly the\nbullet had been discharged at very close quarters. There was only the one pistol found in the room,\ntwo barrels of which had been emptied. Mr. Hilton\nCubitt had been shot through the heart. It was\nequally conceivable that he had shot her and then\nhimself, or that she had been the criminal, for the\nrevolver lay upon the \ufb02oor midway between them. \u201cHas he been moved?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cWe have moved nothing except the lady. We\ncould not leave her lying wounded upon the \ufb02oor.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you been here, doctor?\u201d\n\u201cSince four o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone else?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the constable here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have touched nothing?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cYou have acted with great discretion. Who\nsent for you?\u201d\n\u201cThe housemaid, Saunders.\u201d\n\u201cWas it she who gave the alarm?\u201d\n\u201cShe and Mrs. King, the cook.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are they now?\u201d\n\u201cIn the kitchen, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cThen I think we had better hear their story at\nonce.\u201d\nThe\nold\nhall,\noak-panelled\nand\nhigh-\nwindowed, had been turned into a court of in-\nvestigation."

I could read in them a set purpose to\ndevote his life to this quest until the client whom\nhe had failed to save should at last be avenged. The trim Inspector Martin, the old, grey-headed\ncountry doctor, myself, and a stolid village police-\nman made up the rest of that strange company. The two women told their story clearly enough. They had been aroused from their sleep by the\nsound of an explosion, which had been followed a\nminute later by a second one. They slept in adjoin-\ning rooms, and Mrs. King had rushed in to Saun-\nders. Together they had descended the stairs. The\ndoor of the study was open and a candle was burn-\ning upon the table. Their master lay upon his face\nin the centre of the room. He was quite dead. Near\nthe window his wife was crouching, her head lean-\ning against the wall. She was horribly wounded,\nand the side of her face was red with blood. She\nbreathed heavily, but was incapable of saying any-\nthing. The passage, as well as the room, was full\nof smoke and the smell of powder. The window\nwas certainly shut and fastened upon the inside. Both women were positive upon the point. They\nhad at once sent for the doctor and for the con-\nstable. Then, with the aid of the groom and the\nstable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mis-\ntress to her room. Both she and her husband had\noccupied the bed. She was clad in her dress\u2014he\nin his dressing-gown, over his night clothes. Noth-\ning had been moved in the study. So far as they\nknew there had never been any quarrel between\nhusband and wife. They had always looked upon\nthem as a very united couple. These were the main points of the servants\u2019 ev-\nidence. In answer to Inspector Martin they were\nclear that every door was fastened upon the in-\nside, and that no one could have escaped from\nthe house. In answer to Holmes they both re-\nmembered that they were conscious of the smell\n450\nThe Adventure of the Dancing Men\nof powder from the moment that they ran out of\ntheir rooms upon the top \ufb02oor. \u201cI commend that\nfact very carefully to your attention,\u201d said Holmes\nto his professional colleague. \u201cAnd now I think\nthat we are in a position to undertake a thorough\nexamination of the room.\u201d\nThe study proved to be a small chamber, lined\non three sides with books, and with a writing-\ntable facing an ordinary window, which looked\nout upon the garden. Our \ufb01rst attention was given\nto the body of the unfortunate squire, whose huge\nframe lay stretched across the room. His dis-\nordered dress showed that he had been hastily\naroused from sleep. The bullet had been \ufb01red at\nhim from the front, and had remained in his body\nafter penetrating the heart."

According to the country surgeon\nthe lady had stains upon her face, but none upon\nher hand. \u201cThe absence of the latter means nothing,\nthough its presence may mean everything,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cUnless the powder from a badly-\ufb01tting\ncartridge happens to spurt backwards, one may\n\ufb01re many shots without leaving a sign. I would\nsuggest that Mr. Cubitt\u2019s body may now be re-\nmoved. I suppose, doctor, you have not recovered\nthe bullet which wounded the lady?\u201d\n\u201cA serious operation will be necessary before\nthat can be done. But there are still four car-\ntridges in the revolver. Two have been \ufb01red and\ntwo wounds in\ufb02icted, so that each bullet can be\naccounted for.\u201d\n\u201cSo it would seem,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPerhaps\nyou can account also for the bullet which has so\nobviously struck the edge of the window?\u201d\nHe had turned suddenly, and his long, thin \ufb01n-\nger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled\nright through the lower window-sash about an\ninch above the bottom. \u201cBy George!\u201d cried the inspector. \u201cHow ever\ndid you see that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I looked for it.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d said the country doctor. \u201cYou are\ncertainly right, sir. Then a third shot has been\n\ufb01red, and therefore a third person must have been\npresent. But who could that have been and how\ncould he have got away?\u201d\n\u201cThat is the problem which we are now about\nto solve,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou remember,\nInspector Martin, when the servants said that on\nleaving their room they were at once conscious of\na smell of powder I remarked that the point was\nan extremely important one?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir; but I confess I did not quite follow\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cIt suggested that at the time of the \ufb01ring the\nwindow as well as the door of the room had been\nopen. Otherwise the fumes of powder could not\nhave been blown so rapidly through the house. A\ndraught in the room was necessary for that. Both\ndoor and window were only open for a very short\ntime, however.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you prove that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the candle has not guttered.\u201d\n\u201cCapital!\u201d cried the inspector. \u201cCapital!\u201d\n\u201cFeeling sure that the window had been open\nat the time of the tragedy I conceived that there\nmight have been a third person in the affair, who\nstood outside this opening and \ufb01red through it. Any shot directed at this person might hit the sash. I looked, and there, sure enough, was the bullet\nmark!\u201d\n\u201cBut how came the window to be shut and fas-\ntened?\u201d\n\u201cThe woman\u2019s \ufb01rst instinct would be to shut\nand fasten the window. But, halloa! what is this?\u201d\nIt was a lady\u2019s hand-bag which stood upon the\nstudy table\u2014a trim little hand-bag of crocodile-\nskin and silver. Holmes opened it and turned the\ncontents out. There were twenty \ufb01fty-pound notes\nof the Bank of England, held together by an india-\nrubber band\u2014nothing else."

I am fairly famil-\niar with all forms of secret writings, and am my-\nself the author of a tri\ufb02ing monograph upon the\nsubject, in which I analyze one hundred and sixty\nseparate ciphers; but I confess that this is entirely\n452\nThe Adventure of the Dancing Men\nnew to me. The object of those who invented the\nsystem has apparently been to conceal that these\ncharacters convey a message, and to give the idea\nthat they are the mere random sketches of chil-\ndren. \u201cHaving once recognised, however, that the\nsymbols stood for letters, and having applied the\nrules which guide us in all forms of secret writ-\nings, the solution was easy enough. The \ufb01rst mes-\nsage submitted to me was so short that it was im-\npossible for me to do more than to say with some\ncon\ufb01dence that the symbol\nstood for E. As you are aware, E is the most com-\nmon letter in the English alphabet, and it predom-\ninates to so marked an extent that even in a short\nsentence one would expect to \ufb01nd it most often. Out of \ufb01fteen symbols in the \ufb01rst message four\nwere the same, so it was reasonable to set this\ndown as E. It is true that in some cases the \ufb01g-\nure was bearing a \ufb02ag and in some cases not, but\nit was probable from the way in which the \ufb02ags\nwere distributed that they were used to break the\nsentence up into words. I accepted this as a hy-\npothesis, and noted that E was represented by\n\u201cBut now came the real dif\ufb01culty of the inquiry. The order of the English letters after E is by\nno means well marked, and any preponderance\nwhich may be shown in an average of a printed\nsheet may be reversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, and L\nare the numerical order in which letters occur; but\nT, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other,\nand it would be an endless task to try each combi-\nnation until a meaning was arrived at. I, therefore,\nwaited for fresh material. In my second interview\nwith Mr. Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me two\nother short sentences and one message, which ap-\npeared\u2014since there was no \ufb02ag\u2014to be a single\nword. Here are the symbols. Now, in the single\nword I have already got the two E\u2019s coming sec-\nond and fourth in a word of \ufb01ve letters. It might be\n\u2018sever,\u2019 or \u2018lever,\u2019 or \u2018never.\u2019 There can be no ques-\ntion that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the\nmost probable, and the circumstances pointed to\nits being a reply written by the lady. Accepting it\nas correct, we are now able to say that the symbols\nstand respectively for N, V, and R.\n\u201cEven now I was in considerable dif\ufb01culty, but\na happy thought put me in possession of several\nother letters."

It was certainly some appeal\nto \u2018Elsie.\u2019 In this way I had got my L, S, and I. But what appeal could it be? There were only four\nletters in the word which preceded \u2018Elsie,\u2019 and it\nended in E.

So treated it worked out in this\nfashion:\n.M .ERE ..E SL.NE. \u201cNow the \ufb01rst letter can only be A, which is a\nmost useful discovery, since it occurs no fewer than\nthree times in this short sentence, and the H is also\napparent in the second word. Now it becomes:\u2014\nAM HERE A.E SLANE. Or, \ufb01lling in the obvious vacancies in the name:\u2014\nAM HERE ABE SLANEY. I had so many letters now that I could proceed\nwith considerable con\ufb01dence to the second mes-\nsage, which worked out in this fashion:\u2014\nA. ELRI.ES. Here I could only make sense by putting T and\nG for the missing letters, and supposing that the\nname was that of some house or inn at which the\nwriter was staying.\u201d\nInspector Martin and I had listened with the ut-\nmost interest to the full and clear account of how\nmy friend had produced results which had led to\nso complete a command over our dif\ufb01culties. \u201cWhat did you do then, sir?\u201d asked the inspec-\ntor. \u201cI had every reason to suppose that this Abe\nSlaney was an American, since Abe is an Amer-\nican contraction, and since a letter from America\nhad been the starting-point of all the trouble. I\nhad also every cause to think that there was some\ncriminal secret in the matter. The lady\u2019s allusions\nto her past and her refusal to take her husband\ninto her con\ufb01dence both pointed in that direction. 453\nThe Adventure of the Dancing Men\nI therefore cabled to my friend, Wilson Hargreave,\nof the New York Police Bureau, who has more than\nonce made use of my knowledge of London crime. I asked him whether the name of Abe Slaney was\nknown to him. Here is his reply: \u2018The most dan-\ngerous crook in Chicago.\u2019\nOn the very evening\nupon which I had his answer Hilton Cubitt sent\nme the last message from Slaney. Working with\nknown letters it took this form:\u2014\nELSIE .RE.ARE TO MEET THY GO."

In an in-\nstant Holmes clapped a pistol to his head and\nMartin slipped the handcuffs over his wrists. It\nwas all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow\nwas helpless before he knew that he was attacked. He glared from one to the other of us with a pair\nof blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a bitter\nlaugh. \u201cWell, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this\ntime. I seem to have knocked up against some-\nthing hard.

For this reason I will now lay be-\nfore the reader the facts connected with Miss Vi-\nolet Smith, the solitary cyclist of Charlington, and\nthe curious sequel of our investigation, which cul-\nminated in unexpected tragedy. It is true that the\ncircumstances did not admit of any striking illus-\ntration of those powers for which my friend was\nfamous, but there were some points about the case\nwhich made it stand out in those long records of\ncrime from which I gather the material for these\nlittle narratives. On referring to my note-book for the year 1895\nI \ufb01nd that it was upon Saturday, the 23rd of April,\nthat we \ufb01rst heard of Miss Violet Smith. Her\nvisit was, I remember, extremely unwelcome to\nHolmes, for he was immersed at the moment in a\nvery abstruse and complicated problem concern-\ning the peculiar persecution to which John Vin-\ncent Harden, the well-known tobacco millionaire,\nhad been subjected. My friend, who loved above\nall things precision and concentration of thought,\nresented anything which distracted his attention\nfrom the matter in hand. And yet without a harsh-\nness which was foreign to his nature it was impos-\nsible to refuse to listen to the story of the young\nand beautiful woman, tall, graceful, and queenly,\nwho presented herself at Baker Street late in the\nevening and implored his assistance and advice. It\nwas vain to urge that his time was already fully\noccupied, for the young lady had come with the\ndetermination to tell her story, and it was evident\nthat nothing short of force could get her out of the\nroom until she had done so. With a resigned air\nand a somewhat weary smile, Holmes begged the\nbeautiful intruder to take a seat and to inform us\nwhat it was that was troubling her. \u201cAt least it cannot be your health,\u201d said he, as\nhis keen eyes darted over her; \u201cso ardent a bicyclist\nmust be full of energy.\u201d\nShe glanced down in surprise at her own feet,\nand I observed the slight roughening of the side of\nthe sole caused by the friction of the edge of the\npedal. \u201cYes, I bicycle a good deal, Mr. Holmes, and\nthat has something to do with my visit to you to-\nday.\u201d\nMy friend took the lady\u2019s ungloved hand and\nexamined it with as close an attention and as little\nsentiment as a scientist would show to a specimen. \u201cYou will excuse me, I am sure. It is my busi-\nness,\u201d said he, as he dropped it. \u201cI nearly fell into\nthe error of supposing that you were typewriting. Of course, it is obvious that it is music.

They said that my uncle\nwas a friend of theirs, that he died some months\nbefore in great poverty in Johannesburg, and that\nhe had asked them with his last breath to hunt up\nhis relations and see that they were in no want. It\n459\nThe Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\nseemed strange to us that Uncle Ralph, who took\nno notice of us when he was alive, should be so\ncareful to look after us when he was dead; but Mr.\nCarruthers explained that the reason was that my\nuncle had just heard of the death of his brother,\nand so felt responsible for our fate.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cwhen was this in-\nterview?\u201d\n\u201cLast December\u2014four months ago.\u201d\n\u201cPray proceed.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Woodley seemed to me to be a most odi-\nous person.

I thought that he was perfectly hate-\nful\u2014and I was sure that Cyril would not wish me\nto know such a person.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Cyril is his name!\u201d said Holmes, smiling. The young lady blushed and laughed. \u201cYes, Mr. Holmes; Cyril Morton, an electrical\nengineer, and we hope to be married at the end of\nthe summer. Dear me, how did I get talking about\nhim? What I wished to say was that Mr. Wood-\nley was perfectly odious, but that Mr. Carruthers,\nwho was a much older man, was more agreeable. He was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent per-\nson; but he had polite manners and a pleasant\nsmile.

So it ended by my accepting, and I went down\nto Chiltern Grange, about six miles from Farn-\nham. Mr. Carruthers was a widower, but he had\nengaged a lady-housekeeper, a very respectable,\nelderly person, called Mrs. Dixon, to look after\nhis establishment. The child was a dear, and ev-\nerything promised well. Mr. Carruthers was very\nkind and very musical, and we had most pleasant\nevenings together.

He came for\na visit of a week, and oh, it seemed three months\nto me! He was a dreadful person, a bully to ev-\neryone else, but to me something in\ufb01nitely worse. He made odious love to me, boasted of his wealth,\nsaid that if I married him I would have the \ufb01nest\ndiamonds in London, and \ufb01nally, when I would\nhave nothing to do with him, he seized me in\nhis arms one day after dinner\u2014he was hideously\nstrong\u2014and he swore that he would not let me\ngo until I had kissed him.

You must know that every Saturday\nforenoon I ride on my bicycle to Farnham Station\nin order to get the 12.22 to town. The road from\nChiltern Grange is a lonely one, and at one spot it\nis particularly so, for it lies for over a mile between\nCharlington Heath upon one side and the woods\nwhich lie round Charlington Hall upon the other. You could not \ufb01nd a more lonely tract of road any-\nwhere, and it is quite rare to meet so much as a\ncart, or a peasant, until you reach the high road\nnear Crooksbury Hill. Two weeks ago I was pass-\ning this place when I chanced to look back over\nmy shoulder, and about two hundred yards behind\nme I saw a man, also on a bicycle. He seemed to\nbe a middle-aged man, with a short, dark beard. I looked back before I reached Farnham, but the\nman was gone, so I thought no more about it. But\nyou can imagine how surprised I was, Mr. Holmes,\nwhen on my return on the Monday I saw the same\nman on the same stretch of road."

I slowed\n460\nThe Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\ndown my machine, but he slowed down his. Then\nI stopped altogether, but he stopped also. Then I\nlaid a trap for him.

As if I should not know\nhim!\u201d\n\u201cHave you had any other admirers?\u201d\n\u201cSeveral before I knew Cyril.\u201d\n\u201cAnd since?\u201d\n\u201cThere was this dreadful man, Woodley, if you\ncan call him an admirer.\u201d\n\u201cNo one else?\u201d\nOur fair client seemed a little confused. \u201cWho was he?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cOh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it has\nseemed to me sometimes that my employer, Mr.\nCarruthers, takes a great deal of interest in me. We are thrown rather together. I play his accom-\npaniments in the evening. He has never said any-\nthing. He is a perfect gentleman. But a girl always\nknows.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d Holmes looked grave. \u201cWhat does he do\nfor a living?\u201d\n\u201cHe is a rich man.\u201d\n\u201cNo carriages or horses?\u201d\n\u201cWell, at least he is fairly well-to-do. But he\ngoes into the City two or three times a week. He is\ndeeply interested in South African gold shares.\u201d\n\u201cYou will let me know any fresh development,\nMiss Smith. I am very busy just now, but I will \ufb01nd\ntime to make some inquiries into your case. In the\nmeantime take no step without letting me know. Good-bye, and I trust that we shall have nothing\nbut good news from you.\u201d\n\u201cIt is part of the settled order of Nature that\nsuch a girl should have followers,\u201d said Holmes,\nas he pulled at his meditative pipe, \u201cbut for choice\nnot on bicycles in lonely country roads. Some se-\ncretive lover, beyond all doubt. But there are cu-\nrious and suggestive details about the case, Wat-\nson.\u201d\n\u201cThat he should appear only at that point?\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Our \ufb01rst effort must be to \ufb01nd who\nare the tenants of Charlington Hall. Then, again,\nhow about the connection between Carruthers and\nWoodley, since they appear to be men of such a\ndifferent type? How came they both to be so keen\nupon looking up Ralph Smith\u2019s relations? One\nmore point. What sort of a menage is it which pays\ndouble the market price for a governess, but does\nnot keep a horse although six miles from the sta-\ntion? Odd, Watson\u2014very odd!\u201d\n\u201cYou will go down?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my dear fellow, you will go down. This\nmay be some tri\ufb02ing intrigue, and I cannot break\nmy other important research for the sake of it. On\nMonday you will arrive early at Farnham; you will\nconceal yourself near Charlington Heath; you will\nobserve these facts for yourself, and act as your\nown judgment advises. Then, having inquired\nas to the occupants of the Hall, you will come\nback to me and report. And now, Watson, not\nanother word of the matter until we have a few\nsolid stepping-stones on which we may hope to\nget across to our solution.\u201d\nWe had ascertained from the lady that she went\ndown upon the Monday by the train which leaves\nWaterloo at 9.50, so I started early and caught the\n461\nThe Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\n9.13."

It was im-\npossible to mistake the scene of the young lady\u2019s\nadventure, for the road runs between the open\nheath on one side and an old yew hedge upon\nthe other, surrounding a park which is studded\nwith magni\ufb01cent trees. There was a main gate-\nway of lichen-studded stone, each side pillar sur-\nmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems; but be-\nsides this central carriage drive I observed several\npoints where there were gaps in the hedge and\npaths leading through them. The house was invis-\nible from the road, but the surroundings all spoke\nof gloom and decay. The heath was covered with golden patches\nof \ufb02owering gorse, gleaming magni\ufb01cently in the\nlight of the bright spring sunshine. Behind one\nof these clumps I took up my position, so as to\ncommand both the gateway of the Hall and a long\nstretch of the road upon either side. It had been\ndeserted when I left it, but now I saw a cyclist rid-\ning down it from the opposite direction to that in\nwhich I had come. He was clad in a dark suit, and\nI saw that he had a black beard. On reaching the\nend of the Charlington grounds he sprang from\nhis machine and led it through a gap in the hedge,\ndisappearing from my view. A quarter of an hour passed and then a sec-\nond cyclist appeared. This time it was the young\nlady coming from the station. I saw her look about\nher as she came to the Charlington hedge. An in-\nstant later the man emerged from his hiding-place,\nsprang upon his cycle, and followed her. In all\nthe broad landscape those were the only moving\n\ufb01gures, the graceful girl sitting very straight upon\nher machine, and the man behind her bending low\nover his handle-bar, with a curiously furtive sug-\ngestion in every movement. She looked back at\nhim and slowed her pace. He slowed also. She\nstopped. He at once stopped too, keeping two\nhundred yards behind her. Her next movement\nwas as unexpected as it was spirited. She suddenly\nwhisked her wheels round and dashed straight at\nhim! He was as quick as she, however, and darted\noff in desperate \ufb02ight. Presently she came back up\nthe road again, her head haughtily in the air, not\ndeigning to take any further notice of her silent\nattendant. He had turned also, and still kept his\ndistance until the curve of the road hid them from\nmy sight. I remained in my hiding-place, and it was well\nthat I did so, for presently the man reappeared cy-\ncling slowly back. He turned in at the Hall gates\nand dismounted from his machine. For some few\nminutes I could see him standing among the trees. His hands were raised and he seemed to be settling\nhis necktie. Then he mounted his cycle and rode\naway from me down the drive towards the Hall."

Far away I could catch glimpses of the old grey\nbuilding with its bristling Tudor chimneys, but the\ndrive ran through a dense shrubbery, and I saw no\nmore of my man. However, it seemed to me that I had done a\nfairly good morning\u2019s work, and I walked back\nin high spirits to Farnham. The local house-agent\ncould tell me nothing about Charlington Hall, and\nreferred me to a well-known \ufb01rm in Pall Mall. There I halted on my way home, and met with\ncourtesy from the representative. No, I could not\nhave Charlington Hall for the summer. I was just\ntoo late. It had been let about a month ago. Mr.\nWilliamson was the name of the tenant. He was\na respectable elderly gentleman. The polite agent\nwas afraid he could say no more, as the affairs of\nhis clients were not matters which he could dis-\ncuss. Mr. Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to\nthe long report which I was able to present to him\nthat evening, but it did not elicit that word of curt\npraise which I had hoped for and should have val-\nued. On the contrary, his austere face was even\nmore severe than usual as he commented upon the\nthings that I had done and the things that I had\nnot. \u201cYour hiding-place, my dear Watson, was very\nfaulty. You should have been behind the hedge;\nthen you would have had a close view of this in-\nteresting person. As it is you were some hundreds\nof yards away, and can tell me even less than Miss\nSmith. She thinks she does not know the man; I\nam convinced she does. Why, otherwise, should\nhe be so desperately anxious that she should not\nget so near him as to see his features? You describe\nhim as bending over the handle-bar. Concealment\nagain, you see. You really have done remarkably\nbadly. He returns to the house and you want to\n\ufb01nd out who he is. You come to a London house-\nagent!\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I have done?\u201d I cried, with some\nheat. \u201cGone to the nearest public-house. That is the\ncentre of country gossip. They would have told\nyou every name, from the master to the scullery-\nmaid. Williamson! It conveys nothing to my mind. If he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist\nwho sprints away from that athletic young lady\u2019s\npursuit. What have we gained by your expedition? 462\nThe Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\nThe knowledge that the girl\u2019s story is true. I never\ndoubted it. That there is a connection between the\ncyclist and the Hall. I never doubted that either. That the Hall is tenanted by Williamson. Who\u2019s\nthe better for that? Well, well, my dear sir, don\u2019t\nlook so depressed. We can do little more until next\nSaturday, and in the meantime I may make one or\ntwo inquiries myself.\u201d\nNext morning we had a note from Miss Smith,\nrecounting shortly and accurately the very inci-\ndents which I had seen, but the pith of the letter\nlay in the postscript:\n\u201cI am sure that you will respect my\ncon\ufb01dence, Mr. Holmes, when I tell\nyou that my place here has become dif-\n\ufb01cult owing to the fact that my em-\nployer has proposed marriage to me."

You can un-\nderstand, however, that the situation is\na little strained.\u201d\n\u201cOur young friend seems to be getting into\ndeep waters,\u201d said Holmes, thoughtfully, as he \ufb01n-\nished the letter. \u201cThe case certainly presents more\nfeatures of interest and more possibility of devel-\nopment than I had originally thought. I should\nbe none the worse for a quiet, peaceful day in the\ncountry, and I am inclined to run down this af-\nternoon and test one or two theories which I have\nformed.\u201d\nHolmes\u2019s quiet day in the country had a singu-\nlar termination, for he arrived at Baker Street late\nin the evening with a cut lip and a discoloured\nlump upon his forehead, besides a general air of\ndissipation which would have made his own per-\nson the \ufb01tting object of a Scotland Yard investiga-\ntion. He was immensely tickled by his own adven-\ntures, and laughed heartily as he recounted them. \u201cI get so little active exercise that it is always a\ntreat,\u201d said he. \u201cYou are aware that I have some\npro\ufb01ciency in the good old British sport of boxing. Occasionally it is of service. To-day, for example, I\nshould have come to very ignominious grief with-\nout it.\u201d\nI begged him to tell me what had occurred. \u201cI found that country pub which I had already\nrecommended to your notice, and there I made my\ndiscreet inquiries. I was in the bar, and a gar-\nrulous landlord was giving me all that I wanted. Williamson is a white-bearded man, and he lives\nalone with a small staff of servants at the Hall. There is some rumour that he is or has been a\nclergyman; but one or two incidents of his short\nresidence at the Hall struck me as peculiarly unec-\nclesiastical. I have already made some inquiries\nat a clerical agency, and they tell me that there\nwas a man of that name in orders whose career\nhas been a singularly dark one. The landlord fur-\nther informed me that there are usually week-end\nvisitors\u2014\u2018a warm lot, sir\u2019\u2014at the Hall, and espe-\ncially one gentleman with a red moustache, Mr.\nWoodley by name, who was always there. We had\ngot as far as this when who should walk in but\nthe gentleman himself, who had been drinking his\nbeer in the tap-room and had heard the whole con-\nversation. Who was I? What did I want? What\ndid I mean by asking questions? He had a \ufb01ne\n\ufb02ow of language, and his adjectives were very vig-\norous. He ended a string of abuse by a vicious\nback-hander which I failed to entirely avoid. The\nnext few minutes were delicious. It was a straight\nleft against a slogging ruf\ufb01an. I emerged as you\nsee me. Mr. Woodley went home in a cart."

You\nwill\nnot\nbe\nsurprised,\nMr.\nHolmes [said she] to hear that I am\nleaving Mr. Carruthers\u2019s employment. Even the high pay cannot reconcile me\nto the discomforts of my situation. On\nSaturday I come up to town and I do\nnot intend to return. Mr. Carruthers\nhas got a trap, and so the dangers of\nthe lonely road, if there ever were any\ndangers, are now over. As to the special cause of my leav-\ning, it is not merely the strained situ-\nation with Mr. Carruthers, but it is the\nreappearance of that odious man, Mr.\nWoodley. He was always hideous, but\nhe looks more awful than ever now, for\nhe appears to have had an accident and\nhe is much dis\ufb01gured. I saw him out of\nthe window, but I am glad to say I did\nnot meet him. He had a long talk with\nMr. Carruthers, who seemed much ex-\ncited afterwards. Woodley must be\nstaying in the neighbourhood, for he\ndid not sleep here, and yet I caught\n463\nThe Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\na glimpse of him again this morning\nslinking about in the shrubbery. I\nwould sooner have a savage wild ani-\nmal loose about the place. I loathe and\nfear him more than I can say. How can\nMr. Carruthers endure such a creature\nfor a moment? However, all my trou-\nbles will be over on Saturday. \u201cSo I trust, Watson; so I trust,\u201d said Holmes,\ngravely. \u201cThere is some deep intrigue going on\nround that little woman, and it is our duty to see\nthat no one molests her upon that last journey. I think, Watson, that we must spare time to run\ndown together on Saturday morning, and make\nsure that this curious and inconclusive investiga-\ntion has no untoward ending.\u201d\nI confess that I had not up to now taken a very\nserious view of the case, which had seemed to me\nrather grotesque and bizarre than dangerous. That\na man should lie in wait for and follow a very\nhandsome woman is no unheard-of thing, and if\nhe had so little audacity that he not only dared not\naddress her, but even \ufb02ed from her approach, he\nwas not a very formidable assailant. The ruf\ufb01an\nWoodley was a very different person, but, except\non one occasion, he had not molested our client,\nand now he visited the house of Carruthers with-\nout intruding upon her presence. The man on the\nbicycle was doubtless a member of those week-end\nparties at the Hall of which the publican had spo-\nken; but who he was or what he wanted was as ob-\nscure as ever. It was the severity of Holmes\u2019s man-\nner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his\npocket before leaving our rooms which impressed\nme with the feeling that tragedy might prove to\nlurk behind this curious train of events."

Holmes and I walked along the broad,\nsandy road inhaling the fresh morning air, and\nrejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh\nbreath of the spring. From a rise of the road on\nthe shoulder of Crooksbury Hill we could see the\ngrim Hall bristling out from amidst the ancient\noaks, which, old as they were, were still younger\nthan the building which they surrounded. Holmes\npointed down the long tract of road which wound,\na reddish yellow band, between the brown of the\nheath and the budding green of the woods. Far\naway, a black dot, we could see a vehicle moving\nin our direction. Holmes gave an exclamation of\nimpatience. \u201cI had given a margin of half an hour,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cIf that is her trap she must be making for the\nearlier train. I fear, Watson, that she will be past\nCharlington before we can possibly meet her.\u201d\nFrom the instant that we passed the rise we\ncould no longer see the vehicle, but we hastened\nonwards at such a pace that my sedentary life be-\ngan to tell upon me, and I was compelled to fall\nbehind. Holmes, however, was always in train-\ning, for he had inexhaustible stores of nervous en-\nergy upon which to draw. His springy step never\nslowed until suddenly, when he was a hundred\nyards in front of me, he halted, and I saw him\nthrow up his hand with a gesture of grief and de-\nspair. At the same instant an empty dog-cart, the\nhorse cantering, the reins trailing, appeared round\nthe curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards\nus. \u201cToo late, Watson; too late!\u201d cried Holmes, as\nI ran panting to his side. \u201cFool that I was not to\nallow for that earlier train! It\u2019s abduction, Wat-\nson\u2014abduction! Murder! Heaven knows what! Block the road! Stop the horse! That\u2019s right. Now,\njump in, and let us see if I can repair the conse-\nquences of my own blunder.\u201d\nWe had sprung into the dog-cart, and Holmes,\nafter turning the horse, gave it a sharp cut with\nthe whip, and we \ufb02ew back along the road. As we\nturned the curve the whole stretch of road between\nthe Hall and the heath was opened up. I grasped\nHolmes\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s the man!\u201d I gasped. A solitary cyclist was coming towards us. His\nhead was down and his shoulders rounded as he\nput every ounce of energy that he possessed on to\nthe pedals. He was \ufb02ying like a racer. Suddenly he\nraised his bearded face, saw us close to him, and\npulled up, springing from his machine. That coal-\nblack beard was in singular contrast to the pallor\nof his face, and his eyes were as bright as if he had\na fever."

Stop a minute! Who\u2019s this\nin the bush?\u201d\nIt was a young fellow about seventeen, dressed\nlike an ostler, with leather cords and gaiters.

As to you, Carruthers, you would have\ndone better to keep your pistol in your pocket.\u201d\n\u201cI begin to think so, Mr. Holmes; but when I\nthought of all the precaution I had taken to shield\nthis girl\u2014for I loved her, Mr. Holmes, and it is the\nonly time that ever I knew what love was\u2014it fairly\ndrove me mad to think that she was in the power of\nthe greatest brute and bully in South Africa, a man\nwhose name is a holy terror from Kimberley to Jo-\nhannesburg. Why, Mr. Holmes, you\u2019ll hardly be-\nlieve it, but ever since that girl has been in my em-\nployment I never once let her go past this house,\nwhere I knew these rascals were lurking, without\nfollowing her on my bicycle just to see that she\ncame to no harm. I kept my distance from her,\nand I wore a beard so that she should not recog-\nnise me, for she is a good and high-spirited girl,\nand she wouldn\u2019t have stayed in my employment\nlong if she had thought that I was following her\nabout the country roads.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her of her danger?\u201d\n\u201cBecause then, again, she would have left me,\nand I couldn\u2019t bear to face that. Even if she\ncouldn\u2019t love me it was a great deal to me just to\nsee her dainty form about the house, and to hear\nthe sound of her voice.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cyou call that love, Mr. Car-\nruthers, but I should call it sel\ufb01shness.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the two things go together. Anyhow, I\ncouldn\u2019t let her go. Besides, with this crowd about,\nit was well that she should have someone near to\nlook after her."

His rev-\nerence is our own home-made article. You had\nknown Ralph Smith in South Africa. You had rea-\nson to believe he would not live long. You found\nout that his niece would inherit his fortune. How\u2019s\nthat\u2014eh?\u201d\nCarruthers nodded and Williamson swore. \u201cShe was next-of-kin, no doubt, and you were\naware that the old fellow would make no will.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t read or write,\u201d said Carruthers. \u201cSo you came over, the two of you, and hunted\nup the girl. The idea was that one of you was to\nmarry her and the other have a share of the plun-\nder. For some reason Woodley was chosen as the\nhusband. Why was that?\u201d\n\u201cWe played cards for her on the voyage. He\nwon.\u201d\n\u201cI see. You got the young lady into your ser-\nvice, and there Woodley was to do the courting. She recognised the drunken brute that he was, and\nwould have nothing to do with him. Meanwhile,\nyour arrangement was rather upset by the fact that\nyou had yourself fallen in love with the lady. You\ncould no longer bear the idea of this ruf\ufb01an own-\ning her.\u201d\n\u201cNo, by George, I couldn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cThere was a quarrel between you. He left you\nin a rage, and began to make his own plans inde-\npendently of you.\u201d\n\u201cIt strikes me, Williamson, there isn\u2019t very\nmuch that we can tell this gentleman,\u201d cried Car-\nruthers, with a bitter laugh."

There is my card, sir, and if my evidence can\nbe of help to you in your trial it shall be at your\ndisposal.\u201d\nIn the whirl of our incessant activity it has often\nbeen dif\ufb01cult for me, as the reader has probably\nobserved, to round off my narratives, and to give\nthose \ufb01nal details which the curious might expect."

The Priory is, without exception, the best\nand most select preparatory school in England. Lord Leverstoke, the Earl of Blackwater, Sir Cath-\ncart Soames\u2014they all have entrusted their sons to\nme. But I felt that my school had reached its zenith\nwhen, three weeks ago, the Duke of Holdernesse\nsent Mr. James Wilder, his secretary, with the inti-\nmation that young Lord Saltire, ten years old, his\nonly son and heir, was about to be committed to\nmy charge. Little did I think that this would be\nthe prelude to the most crushing misfortune of my\nlife. \u201cOn May 1st the boy arrived, that being the be-\nginning of the summer term. He was a charm-\ning youth, and he soon fell into our ways. I may\ntell you\u2014I trust that I am not indiscreet, but half-\ncon\ufb01dences are absurd in such a case\u2014that he was\nnot entirely happy at home. It is an open secret\nthat the Duke\u2019s married life had not been a peace-\nful one, and the matter had ended in a separation\nby mutual consent, the Duchess taking up her res-\nidence in the South of France. This had occurred\nvery shortly before, and the boy\u2019s sympathies are\nknown to have been strongly with his mother. He\nmoped after her departure from Holdernesse Hall,\nand it was for this reason that the Duke desired to\nsend him to my establishment. In a fortnight the\nboy was quite at home with us, and was appar-\nently absolutely happy. \u201cHe was last seen on the night of May\n13th\u2014that is, the night of last Monday. His room\nwas on the second \ufb02oor, and was approached\nthrough another larger room in which two boys\nwere sleeping. These boys saw and heard nothing,\nso that it is certain that young Saltire did not pass\nout that way. His window was open, and there is\na stout ivy plant leading to the ground. We could\ntrace no footmarks below, but it is sure that this is\nthe only possible exit. \u201cHis absence was discovered at seven o\u2019clock\non Tuesday morning. His bed had been slept\nin. He had dressed himself fully before going off\nin his usual school suit of black Eton jacket and\ndark grey trousers. There were no signs that any-\none had entered the room, and it is quite certain\nthat anything in the nature of cries, or a struggle,\nwould have been heard, since Caunter, the elder\nboy in the inner room, is a very light sleeper. \u201cWhen Lord Saltire\u2019s disappearance was dis-\ncovered I at once called a roll of the whole es-\ntablishment, boys, masters, and servants. It was\nthen that we ascertained that Lord Saltire had not\nbeen alone in his \ufb02ight."

His bed had also been\nslept in; but he had apparently gone away partly\ndressed, since his shirt and socks were lying on the\n\ufb02oor. He had undoubtedly let himself down by the\nivy, for we could see the marks of his feet where\nhe had landed on the lawn. His bicycle was kept\nin a small shed beside this lawn, and it also was\ngone. \u201cHe had been with me for two years, and came\nwith the best references; but he was a silent, mo-\nrose man, not very popular either with masters or\nboys.

The blind theory won\u2019t\ndo. But the incident is an admirable starting-point\nfor an investigation. After all, a bicycle is not an\neasy thing to conceal or to destroy. One other ques-\ntion.

Besides, the Duke remembers having written.\u201d\n\u201cWhen had he a letter before that?\u201d\n\u201cNot for several days.\u201d\n\u201cHad he ever one from France?\u201d\n\u201cNo; never.\u201d\n\u201cYou see the point of my questions, of course. Either the boy was carried off by force or he went\nof his own free will. In the latter case you would\nexpect that some prompting from outside would\nbe needed to make so young a lad do such a thing. If he has had no visitors, that prompting must have\ncome in letters. Hence I try to \ufb01nd out who were\nhis correspondents.\u201d\n\u201cI fear I cannot help you much. His only corre-\nspondent, so far as I know, was his own father.\u201d\n\u201cWho wrote to him on the very day of his dis-\nappearance. Were the relations between father and\nson very friendly?\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace is never very friendly with any-\none. He is completely immersed in large public\nquestions, and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary\nemotions. But he was always kind to the boy in his\nown way.\u201d\n\u201cBut the sympathies of the latter were with the\nmother?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDid he say so?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThe Duke, then?\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens, no!\u201d\n\u201cThen how could you know?\u201d\n\u201cI have had some con\ufb01dential talks with Mr.\nJames Wilder, his Grace\u2019s secretary."

Come, gentlemen, and\nI will introduce you.\u201d\nI was, of course, familiar with the pictures of\nthe famous statesman, but the man himself was\nvery different from his representation. He was\na tall and stately person, scrupulously dressed,\nwith a drawn, thin face, and a nose which was\ngrotesquely curved and long. His complexion was\nof a dead pallor, which was more startling by con-\ntrast with a long, dwindling beard of vivid red,\nwhich \ufb02owed down over his white waistcoat, with\nhis watch-chain gleaming through its fringe. Such\nwas the stately presence who looked stonily at us\nfrom the centre of Dr. Huxtable\u2019s hearthrug. Be-\nside him stood a very young man, whom I un-\nderstood to be Wilder, the private secretary. He\nwas small, nervous, alert, with intelligent, light-\nblue eyes and mobile features. It was he who at\nonce, in an incisive and positive tone, opened the\nconversation. \u201cI called this morning, Dr. Huxtable, too late to\nprevent you from starting for London. I learned\nthat your object was to invite Mr. Sherlock Holmes\nto undertake the conduct of this case. His Grace\nis surprised, Dr. Huxtable, that you should have\ntaken such a step without consulting him.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I learned that the police had failed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHis Grace is by no means convinced that the\npolice have failed.\u201d\n\u201cBut surely, Mr. Wilder\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou are well aware, Dr. Huxtable, that his\nGrace is particularly anxious to avoid all public\nscandal. He prefers to take as few people as possi-\nble into his con\ufb01dence.\u201d\n\u201cThe matter can be easily remedied,\u201d said the\nbrow-beaten doctor; \u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes can re-\nturn to London by the morning train.\u201d\n\u201cHardly\nthat,\nDoctor,\nhardly\nthat,\u201d\nsaid\nHolmes, in his blandest voice."

Whether I have the shelter of\nyour roof or of the village inn is, of course, for you\nto decide.\u201d\nI could see that the unfortunate doctor was in\nthe last stage of indecision, from which he was\nrescued by the deep, sonorous voice of the red-\nbearded Duke, which boomed out like a dinner-\ngong. \u201cI agree with Mr. Wilder, Dr. Huxtable, that you\nwould have done wisely to consult me. But since\nMr. Holmes has already been taken into your con-\n\ufb01dence, it would indeed be absurd that we should\nnot avail ourselves of his services. Far from go-\ning to the inn, Mr. Holmes, I should be pleased if\nyou would come and stay with me at Holdernesse\nHall.\u201d\n\u201cI thank your Grace. For the purposes of my\ninvestigation I think that it would be wiser for me\nto remain at the scene of the mystery.\u201d\n\u201cJust as you like, Mr. Holmes. Any information\nwhich Mr. Wilder or I can give you is, of course, at\nyour disposal.\u201d\n\u201cIt will probably be necessary for me to see you\nat the Hall,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI would only ask you\nnow, sir, whether you have formed any explana-\ntion in your own mind as to the mysterious disap-\npearance of your son?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, I have not.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me if I allude to that which is painful\nto you, but I have no alternative. Do you think that\nthe Duchess had anything to do with the matter?\u201d\nThe great Minister showed perceptible hesita-\ntion. \u201cI do not think so,\u201d he said, at last. \u201cThe other most obvious explanation is that the\nchild has been kidnapped for the purpose of levy-\ning ransom. You have not had any demand of the\nsort?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\u201cOne more question, your Grace. I understand\nthat you wrote to your son upon the day when this\nincident occurred.\u201d\n\u201cNo; I wrote upon the day before.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. But he received it on that day?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n474\nThe Adventure of the Priory School\n\u201cWas there anything in your letter which might\nhave unbalanced him or induced him to take such\na step?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, certainly not.\u201d\n\u201cDid you post that letter yourself?\u201d\nThe nobleman\u2019s reply was interrupted by his\nsecretary, who broke in with some heat. \u201cHis Grace is not in the habit of posting letters\nhimself,\u201d said he. \u201cThis letter was laid with others\nupon the study table, and I myself put them in the\npost-bag.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure this one was among them?\u201d\n\u201cYes; I observed it.\u201d\n\u201cHow many letters did your Grace write that\nday?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty or thirty. I have a large correspon-\ndence. But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?\u201d\n\u201cNot entirely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cFor my own part,\u201d the Duke continued, \u201cI\nhave advised the police to turn their attention to\nthe South of France. I have already said that I\ndo not believe that the Duchess would encourage\nso monstrous an action, but the lad had the most\nwrong-headed opinions, and it is possible that he\nmay have \ufb02ed to her, aided and abetted by this\nGerman."

It was evident that to his\nintensely aristocratic nature this discussion of his\nintimate family affairs with a stranger was most\nabhorrent, and that he feared lest every fresh ques-\ntion would throw a \ufb01ercer light into the discreetly\nshadowed corners of his ducal history. When the nobleman and his secretary had left,\nmy friend \ufb02ung himself at once with characteristic\neagerness into the investigation. The boy\u2019s chamber was carefully examined,\nand yielded nothing save the absolute conviction\nthat it was only through the window that he could\nhave escaped. The German master\u2019s room and ef-\nfects gave no further clue. In his case a trailer\nof ivy had given way under his weight, and we\nsaw by the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn\nwhere his heels had come down. That one dint in\nthe short green grass was the only material witness\nleft of this inexplicable nocturnal \ufb02ight. Sherlock Holmes left the house alone, and only\nreturned after eleven. He had obtained a large\nordnance map of the neighbourhood, and this he\nbrought into my room, where he laid it out on the\nbed, and, having balanced the lamp in the middle\nof it, he began to smoke over it, and occasionally to\npoint out objects of interest with the reeking amber\nof his pipe. \u201cThis case grows upon me, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cThere are decidedly some points of interest in\nconnection with it. In this early stage I want you\nto realize those geographical features which may\nhave a good deal to do with our investigation. \u201cLook at this map. This dark square is the Pri-\nory School. I\u2019ll put a pin in it. Now, this line is the\nmain road. You see that it runs east and west past\nthe school, and you see also that there is no side\nroad for a mile either way. If these two folk passed\naway by road it was this road.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cBy a singular and happy chance we are able to\nsome extent to check what passed along this road\nduring the night in question. At this point, where\nmy pipe is now resting, a country constable was\non duty from twelve to six. It is, as you perceive,\nthe \ufb01rst cross road on the east side. This man de-\nclares that he was not absent from his post for an\ninstant, and he is positive that neither boy nor man\ncould have gone that way unseen. I have spoken\nwith this policeman to-night, and he appears to me\nto be a perfectly reliable person. That blocks this\nend. We have now to deal with the other. There\nis an inn here, the Red Bull, the landlady of which\nwas ill. She had sent to Mackleton for a doctor,\nbut he did not arrive until morning, being absent\nat another case."

If their\nevidence is good, then we are fortunate enough to\nbe able to block the west, and also to be able to say\nthat the fugitives did not use the road at all.\u201d\n\u201cBut the bicycle?\u201d I objected. \u201cQuite so. We will come to the bicycle\npresently. To continue our reasoning: if these peo-\nple did not go by the road, they must have tra-\nversed the country to the north of the house or\nto the south of the house. That is certain. Let us\nweigh the one against the other. On the south of\nthe house is, as you perceive, a large district of\narable land, cut up into small \ufb01elds, with stone\nwalls between them. There, I admit that a bicycle\nis impossible. We can dismiss the idea. We turn to\nthe country on the north. Here there lies a grove of\ntrees, marked as the \u2018Ragged Shaw,\u2019 and on the far-\nther side stretches a great rolling moor, Lower Gill\n475\nThe Adventure of the Priory School\nMoor, extending for ten miles and sloping gradu-\nally upwards. Here, at one side of this wilderness,\nis Holdernesse Hall, ten miles by road, but only six\nacross the moor. It is a peculiarly desolate plain. A\nfew moor farmers have small holdings, where they\nrear sheep and cattle. Except these, the plover and\nthe curlew are the only inhabitants until you come\nto the Chester\ufb01eld high road. There is a church\nthere, you see, a few cottages, and an inn. Beyond\nthat the hills become precipitous. Surely it is here\nto the north that our quest must lie.\u201d\n\u201cBut the bicycle?\u201d I persisted. \u201cWell, well!\u201d said Holmes, impatiently. \u201cA\ngood cyclist does not need a high road. The moor\nis intersected with paths and the moon was at the\nfull. Halloa! what is this?\u201d\nThere was an agitated knock at the door, and an\ninstant afterwards Dr. Huxtable was in the room. In his hand he held a blue cricket-cap, with a white\nchevron on the peak. \u201cAt last we have a clue!\u201d he cried. \u201cThank\nHeaven! at last we are on the dear boy\u2019s track! It is his cap.\u201d\n\u201cWhere was it found?\u201d\n\u201cIn the van of the gipsies who camped on the\nmoor. They left on Tuesday. To-day the police\ntraced them down and examined their caravan. This was found.\u201d\n\u201cHow do they account for it?\u201d\n\u201cThey shuf\ufb02ed and lied\u2014said that they found\nit on the moor on Tuesday morning. They know\nwhere he is, the rascals! Thank goodness, they are\nall safe under lock and key. Either the fear of the\nlaw or the Duke\u2019s purse will certainly get out of\nthem all that they know.\u201d\n\u201cSo far, so good,\u201d said Holmes, when the doc-\ntor had at last left the room."

The police\nhave really done nothing locally, save the arrest\nof these gipsies. Look here, Watson! There is a\nwatercourse across the moor. You see it marked\nhere in the map. In some parts it widens into a\nmorass. This is particularly so in the region be-\ntween Holdernesse Hall and the school. It is vain\nto look elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather;\nbut at that point there is certainly a chance of some\nrecord being left. I will call you early to-morrow\nmorning, and you and I will try if we can throw\nsome little light upon the mystery.\u201d\nThe day was just breaking when I woke to \ufb01nd\nthe long, thin form of Holmes by my bedside. He was fully dressed, and had apparently already\nbeen out. \u201cI have done the lawn and the bicycle shed,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cI have also had a ramble through the\nRagged Shaw. Now, Watson, there is cocoa ready\nin the next room. I must beg you to hurry, for we\nhave a great day before us.\u201d\nHis eyes shone, and his cheek was \ufb02ushed with\nthe exhilaration of the master workman who sees\nhis work lie ready before him. A very different\nHolmes, this active, alert man, from the introspec-\ntive and pallid dreamer of Baker Street. I felt, as\nI looked upon that supple \ufb01gure, alive with ner-\nvous energy, that it was indeed a strenuous day\nthat awaited us. And yet it opened in the blackest disappoint-\nment. With high hopes we struck across the peaty,\nrusset moor, intersected with a thousand sheep\npaths, until we came to the broad, light-green belt\nwhich marked the morass between us and Holder-\nnesse. Certainly, if the lad had gone homewards,\nhe must have passed this, and he could not pass\nit without leaving his traces. But no sign of him\nor the German could be seen. With a darkening\nface my friend strode along the margin, eagerly\nobservant of every muddy stain upon the mossy\nsurface. Sheep-marks there were in profusion, and\nat one place, some miles down, cows had left their\ntracks. Nothing more. \u201cCheck number one,\u201d said Holmes, looking\ngloomily over the rolling expanse of the moor. \u201cThere is another morass down yonder and a nar-\nrow neck between. Halloa! halloa! halloa! what\nhave we here?\u201d\nWe had come on a small black ribbon of path-\nway. In the middle of it, clearly marked on the\nsodden soil, was the track of a bicycle. \u201cHurrah!\u201d I cried. \u201cWe have it.\u201d\nBut Holmes was shaking his head, and his face\nwas puzzled and expectant rather than joyous. \u201cA bicycle, certainly, but not the bicycle,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cI am familiar with forty-two different im-\npressions left by tyres. This, as you perceive, is\na Dunlop, with a patch upon the outer cover. Hei-\ndegger\u2019s tyres were Palmer\u2019s, leaving longitudi-\nnal stripes."

But this we have utterly\nfailed to do. This track, as you perceive, was made\n476\nThe Adventure of the Priory School\nby a rider who was going from the direction of the\nschool.\u201d\n\u201cOr towards it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, my dear Watson. The more deeply\nsunk impression is, of course, the hind wheel,\nupon which the weight rests. You perceive several\nplaces where it has passed across and obliterated\nthe more shallow mark of the front one. It was un-\ndoubtedly heading away from the school. It may\nor may not be connected with our inquiry, but we\nwill follow it backwards before we go any farther.\u201d\nWe did so, and at the end of a few hundred\nyards lost the tracks as we emerged from the\nboggy portion of the moor. Following the path\nbackwards, we picked out another spot, where a\nspring trickled across it. Here, once again, was the\nmark of the bicycle, though nearly obliterated by\nthe hoofs of cows. After that there was no sign, but\nthe path ran right on into Ragged Shaw, the wood\nwhich backed on to the school. From this wood\nthe cycle must have emerged. Holmes sat down\non a boulder and rested his chin in his hands. I\nhad smoked two cigarettes before he moved. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said he, at last. \u201cIt is, of course,\npossible that a cunning man might change the tyre\nof his bicycle in order to leave unfamiliar tracks. A\ncriminal who was capable of such a thought is a\nman whom I should be proud to do business with. We will leave this question undecided and hark\nback to our morass again, for we have left a good\ndeal unexplored.\u201d\nWe continued our systematic survey of the\nedge of the sodden portion of the moor, and soon\nour perseverance was gloriously rewarded. Right\nacross the lower part of the bog lay a miry path. Holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached\nit. An impression like a \ufb01ne bundle of telegraph\nwires ran down the centre of it. It was the Palmer\ntyre. \u201cHere is Herr Heidegger, sure enough!\u201d cried\nHolmes, exultantly. \u201cMy reasoning seems to have\nbeen pretty sound, Watson.\u201d\n\u201cI congratulate you.\u201d\n\u201cBut we have a long way still to go. Kindly\nwalk clear of the path. Now let us follow the trail. I fear that it will not lead very far.\u201d\nWe found,\nhowever,\nas we advanced that\nthis portion of the moor is intersected with soft\npatches, and, though we frequently lost sight of\nthe track, we always succeeded in picking it up\nonce more. \u201cDo you observe,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat the rider\nis now undoubtedly forcing the pace? There can\nbe no doubt of it. Look at this impression, where\nyou get both tyres clear. The one is as deep as the\nother."

Then there were a few\nfootmarks, and the tyre reappeared once more. \u201cA side-slip,\u201d I suggested. Holmes held up a crumpled branch of \ufb02ower-\ning gorse. To my horror I perceived that the yellow\nblossoms were all dabbled with crimson. On the\npath, too, and among the heather were dark stains\nof clotted blood. \u201cBad!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cBad! Stand clear, Wat-\nson! Not an unnecessary footstep! What do I\nread here? He fell wounded, he stood up, he\nremounted, he proceeded. But there is no other\ntrack. Cattle on this side path. He was surely not\ngored by a bull? Impossible! But I see no traces\nof anyone else. We must push on, Watson. Surely\nwith stains as well as the track to guide us he can-\nnot escape us now.\u201d\nOur search was not a very long one. The tracks\nof the tyre began to curve fantastically upon the\nwet and shining path. Suddenly, as I looked ahead,\nthe gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the\nthick gorse bushes. Out of them we dragged a bi-\ncycle, Palmer-tyred, one pedal bent, and the whole\nfront of it horribly smeared and slobbered with\nblood. On the other side of the bushes a shoe was\nprojecting. We ran round, and there lay the unfor-\ntunate rider. He was a tall man, full bearded, with\nspectacles, one glass of which had been knocked\nout. The cause of his death was a frightful blow\nupon the head, which had crushed in part of his\nskull. That he could have gone on after receiv-\ning such an injury said much for the vitality and\ncourage of the man. He wore shoes, but no socks,\nand his open coat disclosed a night-shirt beneath\nit. It was undoubtedly the German master. Holmes turned the body over reverently, and\nexamined it with great attention. He then sat in\ndeep thought for a time, and I could see by his\nruf\ufb02ed brow that this grim discovery had not, in\nhis opinion, advanced us much in our inquiry. \u201cIt is a little dif\ufb01cult to know what to do, Wat-\nson,\u201d said he, at last. \u201cMy own inclinations are to\npush this inquiry on, for we have already lost so\nmuch time that we cannot afford to waste another\nhour. On the other hand, we are bound to inform\nthe police of the discovery, and to see that this poor\nfellow\u2019s body is looked after.\u201d\n\u201cI could take a note back.\u201d\n477\nThe Adventure of the Priory School\n\u201cBut I need your company and assistance.

The other is the bicycle with the patched Dunlop. Before we start to investigate that, let us try to re-\nalize what we do know so as to make the most of it,\nand to separate the essential from the accidental.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all I wish to impress upon you that the\nboy certainly left of his own free will. He got down\nfrom his window and he went off, either alone or\nwith someone. That is sure.\u201d\nI assented. \u201cWell, now, let us turn to this unfortunate Ger-\nman master. The boy was fully dressed when he\n\ufb02ed. Therefore, he foresaw what he would do. But\nthe German went without his socks. He certainly\nacted on very short notice.\u201d\n\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did he go? Because, from his bedroom\nwindow, he saw the \ufb02ight of the boy. Because he\nwished to overtake him and bring him back. He\nseized his bicycle, pursued the lad, and in pursu-\ning him met his death.\u201d\n\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d\n\u201cNow I come to the critical part of my argu-\nment. The natural action of a man in pursuing a\nlittle boy would be to run after him. He would\nknow that he could overtake him. But the German\ndoes not do so. He turns to his bicycle. I am told\nthat he was an excellent cyclist. He would not do\nthis if he did not see that the boy had some swift\nmeans of escape.\u201d\n\u201cThe other bicycle.\u201d\n\u201cLet us continue our reconstruction. He meets\nhis death \ufb01ve miles from the school\u2014not by a bul-\nlet, mark you, which even a lad might conceivably\ndischarge, but by a savage blow dealt by a vigor-\nous arm. The lad, then, had a companion in his\n\ufb02ight. And the \ufb02ight was a swift one, since it took\n\ufb01ve miles before an expert cyclist could overtake\nthem. Yet we survey the ground round the scene\nof the tragedy. What do we \ufb01nd? A few cattle\ntracks, nothing more. I took a wide sweep round,\nand there is no path within \ufb01fty yards. Another cy-\nclist could have had nothing to do with the actual\nmurder. Nor were there any human footmarks.\u201d\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cthis is impossible.\u201d\n\u201cAdmirable!\u201d he said. \u201cA most illuminating re-\nmark. It is impossible as I state it, and therefore I\nmust in some respect have stated it wrong. Yet you\nsaw for yourself. Can you suggest any fallacy?\u201d\n\u201cHe could not have fractured his skull in a\nfall?\u201d\n\u201cIn a morass, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cI am at my wit\u2019s end.\u201d\n\u201cTut, tut; we have solved some worse prob-\nlems. At least we have plenty of material, if we can\nonly use it. Come, then, and, having exhausted\nthe Palmer, let us see what the Dunlop with the\npatched cover has to offer us.\u201d\nWe picked up the track and followed it on-\nwards for some distance; but soon the moor rose\ninto a long, heather-tufted curve, and we left the\nwatercourse behind us."

Holmes laughed good-naturedly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be glad to see us, anyhow.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we bring him news of his lost son.\u201d\nThe landlord gave a very visible start. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re on his track?\u201d\n\u201cHe has been heard of in Liverpool. They ex-\npect to get him every hour.\u201d\nAgain a swift change passed over the heavy,\nunshaven face. His manner was suddenly genial. \u201cI\u2019ve less reason to wish the Dook well than\nmost men,\u201d said he, \u201cfor I was his head coachman\nonce, and cruel bad he treated me. It was him that\nsacked me without a character on the word of a\nlying corn-chandler. But I\u2019m glad to hear that the\nyoung lord was heard of in Liverpool, and I\u2019ll help\nyou to take the news to the Hall.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWe\u2019ll have some\nfood \ufb01rst. Then you can bring round the bicycle.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got a bicycle.\u201d\nHolmes held up a sovereign. \u201cI tell you, man, that I haven\u2019t got one. I\u2019ll let\nyou have two horses as far as the Hall.\u201d\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cwe\u2019ll talk about it\nwhen we\u2019ve had something to eat.\u201d\nWhen we were left alone in the stone-\ufb02agged\nkitchen it was astonishing how rapidly that\nsprained ankle recovered."

Holmes\nwas lost in thought, and once or twice he walked\nover to the window and stared earnestly out. It\nopened on to a squalid courtyard. In the far cor-\nner was a smithy, where a grimy lad was at work. On the other side were the stables. Holmes had sat\ndown again after one of these excursions, when he\nsuddenly sprang out of his chair with a loud ex-\nclamation. \u201cBy Heaven, Watson, I believe that I\u2019ve got it!\u201d\nhe cried. \u201cYes, yes, it must be so. Watson, do you\nremember seeing any cow-tracks to-day?\u201d\n\u201cYes, several.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cWell, everywhere. They were at the morass,\nand again on the path, and again near where poor\nHeidegger met his death.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Well, now, Watson, how many cows\ndid you see on the moor?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing any.\u201d\n\u201cStrange, Watson, that we should see tracks all\nalong our line, but never a cow on the whole moor;\nvery strange, Watson, eh?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is strange.\u201d\n\u201cNow, Watson, make an effort; throw your\nmind back! Can you see those tracks upon the\npath?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I can.\u201d\n\u201cCan you recall that the tracks were some-\ntimes like that, Watson\u201d\u2014he arranged a number\nof bread-crumbs in this fashion\u2014: : : : :\u2014\u201cand\nsometimes like this\u201d\u2014: . : . : . : .\u2014\u201cand occa-\nsionally like this\u201d\u2014. \u02d9 . \u02d9 . \u02d9 .\u201c Can you remember\nthat?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I cannot.\u201d\n\u201cBut I can. I could swear to it. However, we\nwill go back at our leisure and verify it. What a\nblind beetle I have been not to draw my conclu-\nsion!\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is your conclusion?\u201d\n\u201cOnly that it is a remarkable cow which walks,\ncanters, and gallops. By George, Watson, it was no\nbrain of a country publican that thought out such\na blind as that! The coast seems to be clear, save\nfor that lad in the smithy. Let us slip out and see\nwhat we can see.\u201d\nThere were two rough-haired, unkempt horses\nin the tumble-down stable. Holmes raised the hind\nleg of one of them and laughed aloud. \u201cOld shoes, but newly shod\u2014old shoes, but\nnew nails. This case deserves to be a classic. Let\nus go across to the smithy.\u201d\nThe lad continued his work without regarding\nus. I saw Holmes\u2019s eye darting to right and left\namong the litter of iron and wood which was scat-\ntered about the \ufb02oor. Suddenly, however, we heard\na step behind us, and there was the landlord, his\nheavy eyebrows drawn over his savage eyes, his\nswarthy features convulsed with passion. He held\na short, metal-headed stick in his hand, and he ad-\nvanced in so menacing a fashion that I was right\nglad to feel the revolver in my pocket. \u201cYou infernal spies!\u201d the man cried. \u201cWhat are\nyou doing there?\u201d\n479\nThe Adventure of the Priory School\n\u201cWhy, Mr. Reuben Hayes,\u201d said Holmes, coolly,\n\u201cone might think that you were afraid of our \ufb01nd-\ning something out.\u201d\nThe man mastered himself with a violent effort,\nand his grim mouth loosened into a false laugh,\nwhich was more menacing than his frown."

We had hardly\nsunk from view when the man \ufb02ew past us on\nthe road. Amid a rolling cloud of dust I caught a\nglimpse of a pale, agitated face\u2014a face with hor-\nror in every lineament, the mouth open, the eyes\nstaring wildly in front. It was like some strange\ncaricature of the dapper James Wilder whom we\nhad seen the night before. \u201cThe Duke\u2019s secretary!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cCome,\nWatson, let us see what he does.\u201d\nWe scrambled from rock to rock until in a few\nmoments we had made our way to a point from\nwhich we could see the front door of the inn. Wilder\u2019s bicycle was leaning against the wall be-\nside it. No one was moving about the house, nor\ncould we catch a glimpse of any faces at the win-\ndows. Slowly the twilight crept down as the sun\nsank behind the high towers of Holdernesse Hall. Then in the gloom we saw the two side-lamps of\na trap light up in the stable yard of the inn, and\nshortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs, as it\nwheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious\npace in the direction of Chester\ufb01eld. \u201cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\u201d Holmes\nwhispered. \u201cIt looks like a \ufb02ight.\u201d\n\u201cA single man in a dog-cart, so far as I could\nsee."

Then at last there were steps in\nthe road, a second \ufb01gure was visible for an instant\nagainst the light, the door shut, and all was black\nonce more. Five minutes later a lamp was lit in a\nroom upon the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor. \u201cIt seems to be a curious class of custom that is\ndone by the Fighting Cock,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThe bar is on the other side.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. These are what one may call the pri-\nvate guests. Now, what in the world is Mr. James\nWilder doing in that den at this hour of night, and\nwho is the companion who comes to meet him\nthere? Come, Watson, we must really take a risk\nand try to investigate this a little more closely.\u201d\nTogether we stole down to the road and crept\nacross to the door of the inn. The bicycle still\nleaned against the wall. Holmes struck a match\nand held it to the back wheel, and I heard him\nchuckle as the light fell upon a patched Dunlop\ntyre.

Late at night I heard him consoling Dr. Huxtable,\nprostrated by the tragedy of his master\u2019s death,\nand later still he entered my room as alert and\nvigorous as he had been when he started in the\nmorning. \u201cAll goes well, my friend,\u201d said he. \u201cI\npromise that before to-morrow evening we shall\nhave reached the solution of the mystery.\u201d\nAt eleven o\u2019clock next morning my friend and I\nwere walking up the famous yew avenue of Hold-\nernesse Hall. We were ushered through the mag-\nni\ufb01cent Elizabethan doorway and into his Grace\u2019s\nstudy.

We\nreceived a telegram from Dr. Huxtable yesterday\nafternoon, which told us of your discovery.\u201d\n\u201cI must see the Duke, Mr. Wilder.\u201d\n\u201cBut he is in his room.\u201d\n\u201cThen I must go to his room.\u201d\n\u201cI believe he is in his bed.\u201d\n\u201cI will see him there.\u201d\nHolmes\u2019s cold and inexorable manner showed\nthe secretary that it was useless to argue with him. \u201cVery good, Mr. Holmes; I will tell him that\nyou are here.\u201d\nAfter half an hour\u2019s delay the great nobleman\nappeared. His face was more cadaverous than\never, his shoulders had rounded, and he seemed\nto me to be an altogether older man than he had\nbeen the morning before. He greeted us with a\nstately courtesy and seated himself at his desk, his\nred beard streaming down on to the table. \u201cWell, Mr. Holmes?\u201d said he. But my friend\u2019s eyes were \ufb01xed upon the sec-\nretary, who stood by his master\u2019s chair. \u201cI think, your Grace, that I could speak more\nfreely in Mr. Wilder\u2019s absence.\u201d\nThe man turned a shade paler and cast a ma-\nlignant glance at Holmes. \u201cIf your Grace wishes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes; you had better go. Now, Mr. Holmes,\nwhat have you to say?\u201d\nMy friend waited until the door had closed be-\nhind the retreating secretary. \u201cThe fact is, your Grace,\u201d said he, \u201cthat my col-\nleague, Dr. Watson, and myself had an assurance\nfrom Dr. Huxtable that a reward had been offered\nin this case. I should like to have this con\ufb01rmed\nfrom your own lips.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cIt amounted, if I am correctly informed, to\n\ufb01ve thousand pounds to anyone who will tell you\nwhere your son is?\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd another thousand to the man who will\nname the person or persons who keep him in cus-\ntody?\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cUnder the latter heading is included, no\ndoubt, not only those who may have taken him\naway, but also those who conspire to keep him in\nhis present position?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d cried the Duke, impatiently. \u201cIf\nyou do your work well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you\nwill have no reason to complain of niggardly treat-\nment.\u201d\nMy friend rubbed his thin hands together with\nan appearance of avidity which was a surprise to\nme, who knew his frugal tastes. \u201cI fancy that I see your Grace\u2019s cheque-book\nupon the table,\u201d said he. \u201cI should be glad if you\nwould make me out a cheque for six thousand\npounds. It would be as well, perhaps, for you to\ncross it. The Capital and Counties Bank, Oxford\nStreet branch, are my agents.\u201d\nHis Grace sat very stern and upright in his\nchair, and looked stonily at my friend. \u201cIs this a joke, Mr. Holmes? It is hardly a sub-\nject for pleasantry.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all, your Grace. I was never more\nearnest in my life.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, then?\u201d\n\u201cI mean that I have earned the reward.

No doubt you are right. But surely not in the eyes of the law. A man cannot\nbe condemned for a murder at which he was not\npresent, and which he loathes and abhors as much\nas you do.

I must beg you to be more explicit.\u201d\n\u201cI will conceal nothing from you. I agree with\nyou that complete frankness, however painful it\nmay be to me, is the best policy in this desper-\nate situation to which James\u2019s folly and jealousy\nhave reduced us. When I was a very young man,\nMr. Holmes, I loved with such a love as comes\nonly once in a lifetime. I offered the lady mar-\nriage, but she refused it on the grounds that such\na match might mar my career. Had she lived I\nwould certainly never have married anyone else. She died, and left this one child, whom for her\nsake I have cherished and cared for. I could not\nacknowledge the paternity to the world; but I gave\nhim the best of educations, and since he came to\nmanhood I have kept him near my person. He\nsurprised my secret, and has presumed ever since\nupon the claim which he has upon me and upon\nhis power of provoking a scandal, which would be\nabhorrent to me. His presence had something to\ndo with the unhappy issue of my marriage. Above\nall, he hated my young legitimate heir from the\n\ufb01rst with a persistent hatred. You may well ask me\nwhy, under these circumstances, I still kept James\n482\nThe Adventure of the Priory School\nunder my roof. I answer that it was because I could\nsee his mother\u2019s face in his, and that for her dear\nsake there was no end to my long-suffering. All\nher pretty ways, too\u2014there was not one of them\nwhich he could not suggest and bring back to my\nmemory. I could not send him away."

The fellow was a ras-\ncal from the beginning; but in some extraordinary\nway James became intimate with him. He had al-\nways a taste for low company. When James deter-\nmined to kidnap Lord Saltire it was of this man\u2019s\nservice that he availed himself. You remember\nthat I wrote to Arthur upon that last day. Well,\nJames opened the letter and inserted a note ask-\ning Arthur to meet him in a little wood called the\nRagged Shaw, which is near to the school. He\nused the Duchess\u2019s name, and in that way got\nthe boy to come. That evening James bicycled\nover\u2014I am telling you what he has himself con-\nfessed to me\u2014and he told Arthur, whom he met\nin the wood, that his mother longed to see him,\nthat she was awaiting him on the moor, and that\nif he would come back into the wood at midnight\nhe would \ufb01nd a man with a horse, who would\ntake him to her. Poor Arthur fell into the trap. He came to the appointment and found this fel-\nlow Hayes with a led pony. Arthur mounted,\nand they set off together. It appears\u2014though this\nJames only heard yesterday\u2014that they were pur-\nsued, that Hayes struck the pursuer with his stick,\nand that the man died of his injuries. Hayes\nbrought Arthur to his public-house, the Fighting\nCock, where he was con\ufb01ned in an upper room,\nunder the care of Mrs. Hayes, who is a kindly\nwoman, but entirely under the control of her bru-\ntal husband. \u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, that was the state of affairs\nwhen I \ufb01rst saw you two days ago. I had no more\nidea of the truth than you. You will ask me what\nwas James\u2019s motive in doing such a deed. I answer\nthat there was a great deal which was unreasoning\nand fanatical in the hatred which he bore my heir. In his view he should himself have been heir of\nall my estates, and he deeply resented those social\nlaws which made it impossible. At the same time\nhe had a de\ufb01nite motive also. He was eager that I\nshould break the entail, and he was of opinion that\nit lay in my power to do so. He intended to make\na bargain with me\u2014to restore Arthur if I would\nbreak the entail, and so make it possible for the es-\ntate to be left to him by will. He knew well that I\nshould never willingly invoke the aid of the police\nagainst him. I say that he would have proposed\nsuch a bargain to me, but he did not actually do\nso, for events moved too quickly for him, and he\nhad not time to put his plans into practice."

In deference\nto my promise, and much against my will, I con-\nsented to leave him there for three days under the\ncharge of Mrs. Hayes, since it was evident that it\nwas impossible to inform the police where he was\nwithout telling them also who was the murderer,\nand I could not see how that murderer could be\npunished without ruin to my unfortunate James. You asked for frankness, Mr. Holmes, and I have\ntaken you at your word, for I have now told you\neverything without an attempt at circumlocution\nor concealment. Do you in turn be as frank with\nme.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIn the \ufb01rst place, your\nGrace, I am bound to tell you that you have placed\nyourself in a most serious position in the eyes of\nthe law. You have condoned a felony and you have\naided the escape of a murderer; for I cannot doubt\nthat any money which was taken by James Wilder\nto aid his accomplice in his \ufb02ight came from your\nGrace\u2019s purse.\u201d\nThe Duke bowed his assent. \u201cThis is indeed a most serious matter. Even\nmore culpable in my opinion, your Grace, is your\nattitude towards your younger son. You leave him\nin this den for three days.\u201d\n\u201cUnder solemn promises\u2014\u201d\n483\n\u201cWhat are promises to such people as these? You have no guarantee that he will not be spir-\nited away again. To humour your guilty elder son\nyou have exposed your innocent younger son to\nimminent and unnecessary danger. It was a most\nunjusti\ufb01able action.\u201d\nThe proud lord of Holdernesse was not accus-\ntomed to be so rated in his own ducal hall. The\nblood \ufb02ushed into his high forehead, but his con-\nscience held him dumb. \u201cI will help you, but on one condition only. It is\nthat you ring for the footman and let me give such\norders as I like.\u201d\nWithout a word the Duke pressed the electric\nbell."

They are for the use\nof horses; but they are shaped below with a cloven\nfoot of iron, so as to throw pursuers off the track.

The Adventure of Black Peter\nThe Adventure of Black Peter\nI\nhave never known my friend to be in\nbetter form, both mental and physical,\nthan in the year \u201995. His increasing fame\nhad brought with it an immense prac-\ntice, and I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I\nwere even to hint at the identity of some of the il-\nlustrious clients who crossed our humble thresh-\nold in Baker Street. Holmes, however, like all\ngreat artists, lived for his art\u2019s sake, and, save in\nthe case of the Duke of Holdernesse, I have sel-\ndom known him claim any large reward for his\ninestimable services. So unworldly was he\u2014or\nso capricious\u2014that he frequently refused his help\nto the powerful and wealthy where the problem\nmade no appeal to his sympathies, while he would\ndevote weeks of most intense application to the af-\nfairs of some humble client whose case presented\nthose strange and dramatic qualities which ap-\npealed to his imagination and challenged his in-\ngenuity. In this memorable year \u201995 a curious and in-\ncongruous succession of cases had engaged his at-\ntention, ranging from his famous investigation of\nthe sudden death of Cardinal Tosca\u2014an inquiry\nwhich was carried out by him at the express de-\nsire of His Holiness the Pope\u2014down to his arrest\nof Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which re-\nmoved a plague-spot from the East-End of Lon-\ndon. Close on the heels of these two famous\ncases came the tragedy of Woodman\u2019s Lee, and the\nvery obscure circumstances which surrounded the\ndeath of Captain Peter Carey. No record of the do-\nings of Mr. Sherlock Holmes would be complete\nwhich did not include some account of this very\nunusual affair. During the \ufb01rst week of July my friend had\nbeen absent so often and so long from our lodg-\nings that I knew he had something on hand. The\nfact that several rough-looking men called during\nthat time and inquired for Captain Basil made me\nunderstand that Holmes was working somewhere\nunder one of the numerous disguises and names\nwith which he concealed his own formidable iden-\ntity. He had at least \ufb01ve small refuges in different\nparts of London in which he was able to change\nhis personality. He said nothing of his business to\nme, and it was not my habit to force a con\ufb01dence. The \ufb01rst positive sign which he gave me of the di-\nrection which his investigation was taking was an\nextraordinary one. He had gone out before break-\nfast, and I had sat down to mine, when he strode\ninto the room, his hat upon his head and a huge\nbarbed-headed spear tucked like an umbrella un-\nder his arm."

        "text": "Just\ngive us some short sketch of the essentials.\u201d\nStanley Hopkins drew a slip of paper from his\npocket. \u201cI have a few dates here which will give you the\ncareer of the dead man, Captain Peter Carey. He\nwas born in \u201945\u2014\ufb01fty years of age. He was a most\ndaring and successful seal and whale \ufb01sher. In\n1883 he commanded the steam sealer Sea Unicorn,\nof Dundee. He had then had several successful\nvoyages in succession, and in the following year,\n1884, he retired. After that he travelled for some\nyears, and \ufb01nally he bought a small place called\nWoodman\u2019s Lee, near Forest Row, in Sussex. There\nhe has lived for six years, and there he died just a\nweek ago to-day. \u201cThere were some most singular points about\nthe man. In ordinary life he was a strict Puritan\u2014a\nsilent, gloomy fellow. His household consisted of\nhis wife, his daughter, aged twenty, and two fe-\nmale servants. These last were continually chang-\ning, for it was never a very cheery situation, and\nsometimes it became past all bearing. The man\nwas an intermittent drunkard, and when he had\nthe \ufb01t on him he was a perfect \ufb01end. He has been\nknown to drive his wife and his daughter out of\ndoors in the middle of the night, and \ufb02og them\nthrough the park until the whole village outside\nthe gates was aroused by their screams. \u201cHe was summoned once for a savage assault\nupon the old vicar, who had called upon him to\nremonstrate with him upon his conduct. In short,\nMr. Holmes, you would go far before you found\na more dangerous man than Peter Carey, and I\nhave heard that he bore the same character when\nhe commanded his ship. He was known in the\ntrade as Black Peter, and the name was given him,\nnot only on account of his swarthy features and\nthe colour of his huge beard, but for the humours\nwhich were the terror of all around him. I need\nnot say that he was loathed and avoided by every\none of his neighbours, and that I have not heard\none single word of sorrow about his terrible end. \u201cYou must have read in the account of the in-\nquest about the man\u2019s cabin, Mr. Holmes; but per-\nhaps your friend here has not heard of it. He\nhad built himself a wooden outhouse\u2014he always\ncalled it \u2018the cabin\u2019\u2014a few hundred yards from his\nhouse, and it was here that he slept every night. It was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet by\nten. He kept the key in his pocket, made his own\nbed, cleaned it himself, and allowed no other foot\nto cross the threshold. There are small windows\non each side, which were covered by curtains and\nnever opened. One of these windows was turned\ntowards the high road, and when the light burned\nin it at night the folk used to point it out to each\nother and wonder what Black Peter was doing in\nthere."

        "text": "That\u2019s the window, Mr. Holmes, which gave\nus one of the few bits of positive evidence that\ncame out at the inquest. \u201cYou remember that a stonemason, named\nSlater,\nwalking\nfrom\nForest\nRow\nabout\none\no\u2019clock in the morning\u2014two days before the\nmurder\u2014stopped as he passed the grounds and\nlooked at the square of light still shining among\nthe trees. He swears that the shadow of a man\u2019s\nhead turned sideways was clearly visible on the\nblind, and that this shadow was certainly not that\nof Peter Carey, whom he knew well. It was that\nof a bearded man, but the beard was short and\nbristled forwards in a way very different from that\nof the captain. So he says, but he had been two\nhours in the public-house, and it is some distance\nfrom the road to the window. Besides, this refers\nto the Monday, and the crime was done upon the\nWednesday. \u201cOn the Tuesday Peter Carey was in one of his\nblackest moods, \ufb02ushed with drink and as savage\nas a dangerous wild beast. He roamed about the\nhouse, and the women ran for it when they heard\nhim coming. Late in the evening he went down\nto his own hut. About two o\u2019clock the following\nmorning his daughter, who slept with her window\nopen, heard a most fearful yell from that direc-\ntion, but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl\nand shout when he was in drink, so no notice was\ntaken. On rising at seven one of the maids noticed\nthat the door of the hut was open, but so great\nwas the terror which the man caused that it was\nmidday before anyone would venture down to see\nwhat had become of him. Peeping into the open\n488\nThe Adventure of Black Peter\ndoor they saw a sight which sent them \ufb02ying with\nwhite faces into the village. Within an hour I was\non the spot and had taken over the case. \u201cWell, I have fairly steady nerves, as you know,\nMr. Holmes, but I give you my word that I got a\nshake when I put my head into that little house. It was droning like a harmonium with the \ufb02ies\nand bluebottles, and the \ufb02oor and walls were like\na slaughter-house. He had called it a cabin, and\na cabin it was sure enough, for you would have\nthought that you were in a ship. There was a bunk\nat one end, a sea-chest, maps and charts, a picture\nof the Sea Unicorn, a line of log-books on a shelf, all\nexactly as one would expect to \ufb01nd it in a captain\u2019s\nroom. And there in the middle of it was the man\nhimself, his face twisted like a lost soul in torment,\nand his great brindled beard stuck upwards in his\nagony. Right through his broad breast a steel har-\npoon had been driven, and it had sunk deep into\nthe wood of the wall behind him. He was pinned\nlike a beetle on a card."

As long as the\ncriminal remains upon two legs so long must there\nbe some indentation, some abrasion, some tri\ufb02ing\ndisplacement which can be detected by the sci-\nenti\ufb01c searcher.

However, that\u2019s past praying for now. Yes, there were several objects in the room which\ncalled for special attention. One was the harpoon\nwith which the deed was committed. It had been\nsnatched down from a rack on the wall. Two oth-\ners remained there, and there was a vacant place\nfor the third. On the stock was engraved \u2018S.S.. Sea\nUnicorn, Dundee.\u2019 This seemed to establish that\nthe crime had been done in a moment of fury,\nand that the murderer had seized the \ufb01rst weapon\nwhich came in his way. The fact that the crime\nwas committed at two in the morning, and yet Pe-\nter Carey was fully dressed, suggested that he had\nan appointment with the murderer, which is borne\nout by the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty\nglasses stood upon the table.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cI think that both infer-\nences are permissible. Was there any other spirit\nbut rum in the room?\u201d\n\u201cYes; there was a tantalus containing brandy\nand whisky on the sea-chest. It is of no impor-\ntance to us, however, since the decanters were full,\nand it had therefore not been used.\u201d\n\u201cFor all that its presence has some signi\ufb01-\ncance,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHowever, let us hear some\nmore about the objects which do seem to you to\nbear upon the case.\u201d\n\u201cThere was this tobacco-pouch upon the table.\u201d\n\u201cWhat part of the table?\u201d\n\u201cIt lay in the middle. It was of coarse\nseal-skin\u2014the straight-haired skin, with a leather\nthong to bind it. Inside was \u2018P.C.\u2019 on the \ufb02ap. There was half an ounce of strong ship\u2019s tobacco\nin it.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! What more?\u201d\nStanley Hopkins drew from his pocket a drab-\ncovered note-book.

I told you that I\npicked the book off the \ufb02oor.\u201d\n\u201cWas the blood-stain above or below?\u201d\n\u201cOn the side next the boards.\u201d\n\u201cWhich proves, of course, that the book was\ndropped after the crime was committed.\u201d\n\u201cExactly, Mr. Holmes. I appreciated that point,\nand I conjectured that it was dropped by the mur-\nderer in his hurried \ufb02ight.

It was a terrible household\nthat Black Peter Carey had made for himself, and it\nwas with a sense of relief that we found ourselves\nin the sunlight again and making our way along a\npath which had been worn across the \ufb01elds by the\nfeet of the dead man. The outhouse was the simplest of dwellings,\nwooden-walled, shingle-roofed, one window be-\nside the door and one on the farther side. Stanley\nHopkins drew the key from his pocket, and had\nstooped to the lock, when he paused with a look\nof attention and surprise upon his face. \u201cSomeone has been tampering with it,\u201d he said. There could be no doubt of the fact. The wood-\nwork was cut and the scratches showed white\nthrough the paint, as if they had been that instant\ndone."

He must have\nbeen a very poor burglar.\u201d\n490\nThe Adventure of Black Peter\n\u201cThis is a most extraordinary thing,\u201d said the\ninspector; \u201cI could swear that these marks were\nnot here yesterday evening.\u201d\n\u201cSome curious person from the village, per-\nhaps,\u201d I suggested. \u201cVery unlikely. Few of them would dare to\nset foot in the grounds, far less try to force their\nway into the cabin. What do you think of it, Mr.\nHolmes?\u201d\n\u201cI think that fortune is very kind to us.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that the person will come again?\u201d\n\u201cIt is very probable. He came expecting to \ufb01nd\nthe door open. He tried to get in with the blade\nof a very small penknife. He could not manage it. What would he do?\u201d\n\u201cCome again next night with a more useful\ntool.\u201d\n\u201cSo I should say. It will be our fault if we are\nnot there to receive him. Meanwhile, let me see\nthe inside of the cabin.\u201d\nThe traces of the tragedy had been removed,\nbut the furniture within the little room still stood\nas it had been on the night of the crime. For two\nhours, with most intense concentration, Holmes\nexamined every object in turn, but his face showed\nthat his quest was not a successful one. Once only\nhe paused in his patient investigation. \u201cHave you taken anything off this shelf, Hop-\nkins?\u201d\n\u201cNo; I have moved nothing.\u201d\n\u201cSomething has been taken. There is less dust\nin this corner of the shelf than elsewhere. It may\nhave been a book lying on its side. It may have\nbeen a box. Well, well, I can do nothing more. Let\nus walk in these beautiful woods, Watson, and give\na few hours to the birds and the \ufb02owers. We shall\nmeet you here later, Hopkins, and see if we can\ncome to closer quarters with the gentleman who\nhas paid this visit in the night.\u201d\nIt was past eleven o\u2019clock when we formed\nour little ambuscade. Hopkins was for leaving\nthe door of the hut open, but Holmes was of the\nopinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the\nstranger. The lock was a perfectly simple one, and\nonly a strong blade was needed to push it back. Holmes also suggested that we should wait, not\ninside the hut, but outside it among the bushes\nwhich grew round the farther window. In this way\nwe should be able to watch our man if he struck a\nlight, and see what his object was in this stealthy\nnocturnal visit. It was a long and melancholy vigil, and yet\nbrought with it something of the thrill which the\nhunter feels when he lies beside the water pool\nand waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of\nprey. What savage creature was it which might\nsteal upon us out of the darkness? Was it a \ufb01erce\ntiger of crime, which could only be taken \ufb01ght-\ning hard with \ufb02ashing fang and claw, or would it\nprove to be some skulking jackal, dangerous only\nto the weak and unguarded?"

At \ufb01rst\nthe steps of a few belated villagers, or the sound of\nvoices from the village, lightened our vigil; but one\nby one these interruptions died away and an abso-\nlute stillness fell upon us, save for the chimes of\nthe distant church, which told us of the progress\nof the night, and for the rustle and whisper of a\n\ufb01ne rain falling amid the foliage which roofed us\nin. Half-past two had chimed, and it was the dark-\nest hour which precedes the dawn, when we all\nstarted as a low but sharp click came from the di-\nrection of the gate. Someone had entered the drive. Again there was a long silence, and I had begun to\nfear that it was a false alarm, when a stealthy step\nwas heard upon the other side of the hut, and a\nmoment later a metallic scraping and clinking. The\nman was trying to force the lock! This time his skill\nwas greater or his tool was better, for there was a\nsudden snap and the creak of the hinges. Then\na match was struck, and next instant the steady\nlight from a candle \ufb01lled the interior of the hut. Through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riv-\neted upon the scene within. The nocturnal visitor was a young man, frail\nand thin, with a black moustache which intensi\ufb01ed\nthe deadly pallor of his face. He could not have\nbeen much above twenty years of age. I have never\nseen any human being who appeared to be in such\na pitiable fright, for his teeth were visibly chatter-\ning and he was shaking in every limb. He was\ndressed like a gentleman, in Norfolk jacket and\nknickerbockers, with a cloth cap upon his head. We watched him staring round with frightened\neyes. Then he laid the candle-end upon the ta-\nble and disappeared from our view into one of the\ncorners. He returned with a large book, one of the\nlog-books which formed a line upon the shelves. Leaning on the table he rapidly turned over the\nleaves of this volume until he came to the entry\nwhich he sought. Then, with an angry gesture of\nhis clenched hand, he closed the book, replaced it\nin the corner, and put out the light. He had hardly\n491\nThe Adventure of Black Peter\nturned to leave the hut when Hopkins\u2019s hand was\non the fellow\u2019s collar, and I heard his loud gasp\nof terror as he understood that he was taken. The\ncandle was re-lit, and there was our wretched cap-\ntive shivering and cowering in the grasp of the de-\ntective. He sank down upon the sea-chest, and\nlooked helplessly from one of us to the other. \u201cNow, my \ufb01ne fellow,\u201d said Stanley Hopkins,\n\u201cwho are you, and what do you want here?\u201d\nThe man pulled himself together and faced us\nwith an effort at self-composure."

And yet I hate to think of this old scandal\ngaining a new lease of life. Did you ever hear of\nDawson and Neligan?\u201d\nI could see from Hopkins\u2019s face that he never\nhad; but Holmes was keenly interested. \u201cYou mean the West-country bankers,\u201d said he. \u201cThey failed for a million, ruined half the county\nfamilies of Cornwall, and Neligan disappeared.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Neligan was my father.\u201d\nAt last we were getting something positive, and\nyet it seemed a long gap between an absconding\nbanker and Captain Peter Carey pinned against\nthe wall with one of his own harpoons. We all\nlistened intently to the young man\u2019s words. \u201cIt was my father who was really concerned. Dawson had retired. I was only ten years of age at\nthe time, but I was old enough to feel the shame\nand horror of it all. It has always been said that\nmy father stole all the securities and \ufb02ed. It is not\ntrue. It was his belief that if he were given time in\nwhich to realize them all would be well and every\ncreditor paid in full. He started in his little yacht\nfor Norway just before the warrant was issued for\nhis arrest. I can remember that last night when\nhe bade farewell to my mother. He left us a list\nof the securities he was taking, and he swore that\nhe would come back with his honour cleared, and\nthat none who had trusted him would suffer. Well,\nno word was ever heard from him again. Both the\nyacht and he vanished utterly. We believed, my\nmother and I, that he and it, with the securities\nthat he had taken with him, were at the bottom of\nthe sea. We had a faithful friend, however, who is a\nbusiness man, and it was he who discovered some\ntime ago that some of the securities which my fa-\nther had with him have reappeared on the London\nmarket. You can imagine our amazement. I spent\nmonths in trying to trace them, and at last, after\nmany doublings and dif\ufb01culties, I discovered that\nthe original seller had been Captain Peter Carey,\nthe owner of this hut. \u201cNaturally, I made some inquiries about the\nman. I found that he had been in command of\na whaler which was due to return from the Arctic\nseas at the very time when my father was cross-\ning to Norway."

My father\u2019s yacht may well have\nbeen blown to the north, and there met by Captain\nPeter Carey\u2019s ship. If that were so, what had be-\ncome of my father? In any case, if I could prove\nfrom Peter Carey\u2019s evidence how these securities\ncame on the market it would be a proof that my\nfather had not sold them, and that he had no view\nto personal pro\ufb01t when he took them. \u201cI came down to Sussex with the intention of\nseeing the captain, but it was at this moment that\nhis terrible death occurred. I read at the inquest a\ndescription of his cabin, in which it stated that the\nold log-books of his vessel were preserved in it. It\nstruck me that if I could see what occurred in the\nmonth of August, 1883, on board the Sea Unicorn, I\nmight settle the mystery of my father\u2019s fate. I tried\nlast night to get at these log-books, but was unable\nto open the door.

He snatched one of them up, opened\nit, and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of\nlaughter. \u201cExcellent, Watson. The alternative develops. Have you telegraph forms?

What more\ncould one ask for?\u201d\n\u201cDoes your explanation cover every point?\u201d\n\u201cUndoubtedly. I \ufb01nd that young Neligan ar-\nrived at the Brambletye Hotel on the very day of\nthe crime. He came on the pretence of playing\ngolf. His room was on the ground-\ufb02oor, and he\ncould get out when he liked. That very night he\nwent down to Woodman\u2019s Lee, saw Peter Carey\nat the hut, quarrelled with him, and killed him\nwith the harpoon. Then, horri\ufb01ed by what he had\ndone, he \ufb02ed out of the hut, dropping the note-\nbook which he had brought with him in order to\nquestion Peter Carey about these different securi-\nties. You may have observed that some of them\nwere marked with ticks, and the others\u2014the great\nmajority\u2014were not. Those which are ticked have\nbeen traced on the London market; but the others\npresumably were still in the possession of Carey,\nand young Neligan, according to his own account,\nwas anxious to recover them in order to do the\nright thing by his father\u2019s creditors. After his \ufb02ight\nhe did not dare to approach the hut again for some\ntime; but at last he forced himself to do so in order\nto obtain the information which he needed. Surely\nthat is all simple and obvious?\u201d\nHolmes smiled and shook his head. \u201cIt seems to me to have only one drawback,\nHopkins, and that is that it is intrinsically impos-\nsible. Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a\nbody? No? Tut, tut, my dear sir, you must really\npay attention to these details.

We were coming out of the ice-pack\non our way home, with head winds and a week\u2019s\nsoutherly gale, when we picked up a little craft\nthat had been blown north. There was one man\non her\u2014a landsman. The crew had thought she\nwould founder, and had made for the Norwegian\ncoast in the dinghy. I guess they were all drowned. Well, we took him on board, this man, and he and\nthe skipper had some long talks in the cabin. All\nthe baggage we took off with him was one tin box. So far as I know, the man\u2019s name was never men-\ntioned, and on the second night he disappeared\nas if he had never been. It was given out that\nhe had either thrown himself overboard or fallen\noverboard in the heavy weather that we were hav-\ning. Only one man knew what had happened to\nhim, and that was me, for with my own eyes I saw\nthe skipper tip up his heels and put him over the\nrail in the middle watch of a dark night, two days\nbefore we sighted the Shetland lights. \u201cWell, I kept my knowledge to myself and\nwaited to see what would come of it. When we\ngot back to Scotland it was easily hushed up, and\nnobody asked any questions. A stranger died by\nan accident, and it was nobody\u2019s business to in-\nquire. Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the sea,\nand it was long years before I could \ufb01nd where he\nwas. I guessed that he had done the deed for the\nsake of what was in that tin box, and that he could\nafford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth\nshut. \u201cI found out where he was through a sailor\nman that had met him in London, and down I\nwent to squeeze him. The \ufb01rst night he was rea-\nsonable enough, and was ready to give me what\nwould make me free of the sea for life. We were\nto \ufb01x it all two nights later. When I came I found\nhim three parts drunk and in a vile temper. We\nsat down and we drank and we yarned about old\ntimes, but the more he drank the less I liked the\nlook on his face. I spotted that harpoon upon the\nwall, and I thought I might need it before I was\nthrough. Then at last he broke out at me, spitting\nand cursing, with murder in his eyes and a great\nclasp-knife in his hand. He had not time to get it\nfrom the sheath before I had the harpoon through\nhim. Heavens! what a yell he gave; and his face\ngets between me and my sleep! I stood there, with\nhis blood splashing round me, and I waited for a\nbit; but all was quiet, so I took heart once more. I\nlooked round, and there was the tin box on a shelf."

A man came slinking along, went into\nthe hut, gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost, and\nlegged it as hard as he could run until he was out\nof sight. Who he was or what he wanted is more\nthan I can tell. For my part I walked ten miles, got\na train at Tunbridge Wells, and so reached London,\nand no one the wiser. \u201cWell, when I came to examine the box I found\nthere was no money in it, and nothing but papers\nthat I would not dare to sell. I had lost my hold on\nBlack Peter, and was stranded in London without a\nshilling. There was only my trade left. I saw these\nadvertisements about harpooners and high wages,\nso I went to the shipping agents, and they sent me\nhere. That\u2019s all I know, and I say again that if I\nkilled Black Peter the law should give me thanks,\nfor I saved them the price of a hempen rope.\u201d\n\u201cA very clear statement,\u201d said Holmes, rising\nand lighting his pipe. \u201cI think, Hopkins, that you\nshould lose no time in conveying your prisoner to\na place of safety. This room is not well adapted for\na cell, and Mr. Patrick Cairns occupies too large a\nproportion of our carpet.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Holmes,\u201d said Hopkins, \u201cI do not know\nhow to express my gratitude. Even now I do not\nunderstand how you attained this result.\u201d\n\u201cSimply by having the good fortune to get the\nright clue from the beginning. It is very possible\nif I had known about this note-book it might have\nled away my thoughts, as it did yours. But all I\nheard pointed in the one direction. The amazing\nstrength, the skill in the use of the harpoon, the\nrum and water, the seal-skin tobacco-pouch, with\n495\nthe coarse tobacco\u2014all these pointed to a seaman,\nand one who had been a whaler. I was convinced\nthat the initials \u2018P.C.\u2019 upon the pouch were a coin-\ncidence, and not those of Peter Carey, since he sel-\ndom smoked, and no pipe was found in his cabin. You remember that I asked whether whisky and\nbrandy were in the cabin. You said they were. How many landsmen are there who would drink\nrum when they could get these other spirits? Yes,\nI was certain it was a seaman.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how did you \ufb01nd him?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear sir, the problem had become a very\nsimple one. If it were a seaman, it could only\nbe a seaman who had been with him on the Sea\nUnicorn. So far as I could learn he had sailed in\nno other ship."

For a\nlong time, even with the utmost discre-\ntion and reticence, it would have been impossible\nto make the facts public; but now the principal per-\nson concerned is beyond the reach of human law,\nand with due suppression the story may be told in\nsuch fashion as to injure no one. It records an abso-\nlutely unique experience in the career both of Mr.\nSherlock Holmes and of myself. The reader will\nexcuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by\nwhich he might trace the actual occurrence. We had been out for one of our evening ram-\nbles, Holmes and I, and had returned about six\no\u2019clock on a cold, frosty winter\u2019s evening. As\nHolmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a\ncard on the table. He glanced at it, and then, with\nan ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the \ufb02oor. I\npicked it up and read:\u2014\nCharles Augustus Milverton,\nAppledore Towers,\nHampstead. Agent. \u201cWho is he?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe worst man in London,\u201d Holmes an-\nswered, as he sat down and stretched his legs be-\nfore the \ufb01re. \u201cIs anything on the back of the card?\u201d\nI turned it over. \u201cWill call at 6.30\u2014C.A.M.,\u201d I read. \u201cHum!

Well, that\u2019s how\nMilverton impresses me. I\u2019ve had to do with \ufb01fty\nmurderers in my career, but the worst of them\nnever gave me the repulsion which I have for this\nfellow. And yet I can\u2019t get out of doing business\nwith him\u2014indeed, he is here at my invitation.\u201d\n\u201cBut who is he?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Watson."

His method is as follows: He\nallows it to be known that he is prepared to pay\nvery high sums for letters which compromise peo-\nple of wealth or position. He receives these wares\nnot only from treacherous valets or maids, but fre-\nquently from genteel ruf\ufb01ans who have gained the\ncon\ufb01dence and affection of trusting women.

There was\nsomething of Mr. Pickwick\u2019s benevolence in his\nappearance, marred only by the insincerity of the\n\ufb01xed smile and by the hard glitter of those rest-\nless and penetrating eyes. His voice was as smooth\nand suave as his countenance, as he advanced with\na plump little hand extended, murmuring his re-\ngret for having missed us at his \ufb01rst visit. Holmes\ndisregarded the outstretched hand and looked at\nhim with a face of granite. Milverton\u2019s smile\nbroadened; he shrugged his shoulders, removed\nhis overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over\nthe back of a chair, and then took a seat. \u201cThis gentleman?\u201d said he, with a wave in my\ndirection. \u201cIs it discreet?

Has she empowered\nyou to accept my terms?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are your terms?\u201d\n\u201cSeven thousand pounds.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the alternative?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it;\nbut if the money is not paid on the 14th there cer-\ntainly will be no marriage on the 18th.\u201d His insuf-\nferable smile was more complacent than ever. Holmes thought for a little. \u201cYou appear to me,\u201d he said, at last, \u201cto be tak-\ning matters too much for granted. I am, of course,\nfamiliar with the contents of these letters. My\nclient will certainly do what I may advise.

From the baf\ufb02ed look upon Holmes\u2019s face I\ncould see clearly that he did. \u201cWhat harm is there in the letters?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey are sprightly\u2014very sprightly,\u201d Milver-\nton answered. \u201cThe lady was a charming corre-\nspondent. But I can assure you that the Earl of\nDovercourt would fail to appreciate them. How-\never, since you think otherwise, we will let it rest\nat that. It is purely a matter of business. If you\nthink that it is in the best interests of your client\nthat these letters should be placed in the hands of\nthe Earl, then you would indeed be foolish to pay\nso large a sum of money to regain them.\u201d He rose\nand seized his astrachan coat.

This has been done so often, and what good\nhas ever come from it? I assure you that I am\narmed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to\nuse my weapons, knowing that the law will sup-\nport me. Besides, your supposition that I would\nbring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mis-\ntaken. I would do nothing so foolish.

With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Mil-\nverton was out of the room, and a few moments\nafter we heard the slam of the carriage door and\nthe rattle of the wheels as he drove away. Holmes sat motionless by the \ufb01re, his hands\nburied deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk\nupon his breast, his eyes \ufb01xed upon the glowing\nembers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his\ndecision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his\nbedroom. A little later a rakish young workman\nwith a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe\nat the lamp before descending into the street. \u201cI\u2019ll\nbe back some time, Watson,\u201d said he, and vanished\ninto the night.

For some days Holmes came and went at all\nhours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his\ntime was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not\nwasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening,\nwhen the wind screamed and rattled against the\nwindows, he returned from his last expedition,\nand having removed his disguise he sat before the\n\ufb01re and laughed heartily in his silent inward fash-\nion. \u201cYou would not call me a marrying man, Wat-\nson?\u201d\n\u201cNo, indeed!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be interested to hear that I am en-\ngaged.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow!

I am never precipitate in my actions, nor\nwould I adopt so energetic and indeed so danger-\nous a course if any other were possible. Let us\nlook at the matter clearly and fairly. I suppose that\nyou will admit that the action is morally justi\ufb01able,\n501\nThe Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\nthough technically criminal. To burgle his house is\nno more than to forcibly take his pocket-book\u2014an\naction in which you were prepared to aid me.\u201d\nI turned it over in my mind. \u201cYes,\u201d I said; \u201cit is morally justi\ufb01able so long\nas our object is to take no articles save those which\nare used for an illegal purpose.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.

Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress\nupon this when a lady is in most desperate need\nof his help?\u201d\n\u201cYou will be in such a false position.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that is part of the risk. There is no other\npossible way of regaining these letters. The un-\nfortunate lady has not the money, and there are\nnone of her people in whom she could con\ufb01de. To-morrow is the last day of grace, and unless we\ncan get the letters to-night this villain will be as\ngood as his word and will bring about her ruin. I must, therefore, abandon my client to her fate\nor I must play this last card. Between ourselves,\nWatson, it\u2019s a sporting duel between this fellow\nMilverton and me. He had, as you saw, the best\nof the \ufb01rst exchanges; but my self-respect and my\nreputation are concerned to \ufb01ght it to a \ufb01nish.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like it; but I suppose it must be,\u201d\nsaid I. \u201cWhen do we start?\u201d\n\u201cYou are not coming.\u201d\n\u201cThen you are not going,\u201d said I."

The thick, warm air of the conservatory\nand the rich, choking fragrance of exotic plants\ntook us by the throat. He seized my hand in the\ndarkness and led me swiftly past banks of shrubs\nwhich brushed against our faces. Holmes had re-\nmarkable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in\nthe dark. Still holding my hand in one of his he\nopened a door, and I was vaguely conscious that\nwe had entered a large room in which a cigar had\nbeen smoked not long before. He felt his way\namong the furniture, opened another door, and\nclosed it behind us. Putting out my hand I felt\nseveral coats hanging from the wall, and I under-\nstood that I was in a passage. We passed along it,\nand Holmes very gently opened a door upon the\nright-hand side. Something rushed out at us and\nmy heart sprang into my mouth, but I could have\nlaughed when I realized that it was the cat. A \ufb01re\nwas burning in this new room, and again the air\nwas heavy with tobacco smoke. Holmes entered\non tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and then very\ngently closed the door. We were in Milverton\u2019s\nstudy, and a portiere at the farther side showed the\nentrance to his bedroom. It was a good \ufb01re, and the room was illumi-\nnated by it. Near the door I saw the gleam of an\nelectric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it\nhad been safe, to turn it on. At one side of the \ufb01re-\nplace was a heavy curtain, which covered the bay\nwindow we had seen from outside. On the other\nside was the door which communicated with the\nveranda. A desk stood in the centre, with a turn-\ning chair of shining red leather. Opposite was a\nlarge bookcase, with a marble bust of Athene on\nthe top. In the corner between the bookcase and\nthe wall there stood a tall green safe, the \ufb01relight\n\ufb02ashing back from the polished brass knobs upon\nits face."

Meanwhile it had struck me\nthat it would be wise to secure our retreat through\nthe outer door, so I examined it. To my amazement\nit was neither locked nor bolted! I touched Holmes\non the arm, and he turned his masked face in that\ndirection. I saw him start, and he was evidently as\nsurprised as I. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he whispered, putting his lips\nto my very ear. \u201cI can\u2019t quite make it out. Anyhow,\nwe have no time to lose.\u201d\n\u201cCan I do anything?\u201d\n\u201cYes; stand by the door. If you hear anyone\ncome, bolt it on the inside, and we can get away\nas we came. If they come the other way, we can\nget through the door if our job is done, or hide\nbehind these window curtains if it is not. Do you\nunderstand?\u201d\nI nodded and stood by the door. My \ufb01rst feel-\ning of fear had passed away, and I thrilled now\nwith a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when\nwe were the defenders of the law instead of its\nde\ufb01ers. The high object of our mission, the con-\nsciousness that it was unsel\ufb01sh and chivalrous, the\nvillainous character of our opponent, all added to\nthe sporting interest of the adventure. Far from\nfeeling guilty, I rejoiced and exulted in our dan-\ngers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes\nunrolling his case of instruments and choosing his\ntool with the calm, scienti\ufb01c accuracy of a surgeon\nwho performs a delicate operation. I knew that\nthe opening of safes was a particular hobby with\nhim, and I understood the joy which it gave him\nto be confronted with this green and gold mon-\nster, the dragon which held in its maw the repu-\ntations of many fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs\nof his dress-coat\u2014he had placed his overcoat on a\nchair\u2014Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and\nseveral skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door\nwith my eyes glancing at each of the others, ready\nfor any emergency; though, indeed, my plans were\nsomewhat vague as to what I should do if we were\ninterrupted. For half an hour Holmes worked with\nconcentrated energy, laying down one tool, pick-\ning up another, handling each with the strength\nand delicacy of the trained mechanic. Finally I\nheard a click, the broad green door swung open,\nand inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper\npackets, each tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes\npicked one out, but it was hard to read by the \ufb02ick-\nering \ufb01re, and he drew out his little dark lantern,\nfor it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the\nnext room, to switch on the electric light. Suddenly\nI saw him halt, listen intently, and then in an in-\nstant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked\nup his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and\ndarted behind the window curtain, motioning me\nto do the same."

Then a confused, dull\n503\nThe Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\nmurmur broke itself into the measured thud of\nheavy footsteps rapidly approaching. They were in\nthe passage outside the room. They paused at the\ndoor. The door opened. There was a sharp snick\nas the electric light was turned on. The door closed\nonce more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar\nwas borne to our nostrils. Then the footsteps con-\ntinued backwards and forwards, backwards and\nforwards, within a few yards of us. Finally, there\nwas a creak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased. Then a key clicked in a lock and I heard the rustle\nof papers. So far I had not dared to look out, but now I\ngently parted the division of the curtains in front\nof me and peeped through. From the pressure of\nHolmes\u2019s shoulder against mine I knew that he\nwas sharing my observations. Right in front of\nus, and almost within our reach, was the broad,\nrounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we\nhad entirely miscalculated his movements, that he\nhad never been to his bedroom, but that he had\nbeen sitting up in some smoking or billiard room\nin the farther wing of the house, the windows of\nwhich we had not seen. His broad, grizzled head,\nwith its shining patch of baldness, was in the im-\nmediate foreground of our vision. He was lean-\ning far back in the red leather chair, his legs out-\nstretched, a long black cigar projecting at an angle\nfrom his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking\njacket, claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long legal document, which\nhe was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing\nrings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise of a speedy departure in his\ncomposed bearing and his comfortable attitude. I felt Holmes\u2019s hand steal into mine and give\nme a reassuring shake, as if to say that the situa-\ntion was within his powers and that he was easy\nin his mind. I was not sure whether he had seen\nwhat was only too obvious from my position, that\nthe door of the safe was imperfectly closed, and\nthat Milverton might at any moment observe it. In\nmy own mind I had determined that if I were sure,\nfrom the rigidity of his gaze, that it had caught his\neye, I would at once spring out, throw my great-\ncoat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest\nto Holmes. But Milverton never looked up. He\nwas languidly interested by the papers in his hand,\nand page after page was turned as he followed\nthe argument of the lawyer. At least, I thought,\nwhen he has \ufb01nished the document and the cigar\nhe will go to his room; but before he had reached\nthe end of either there came a remarkable devel-\nopment which turned our thoughts into quite an-\nother channel."

The\nidea, however, that he might have an appointment\nat so strange an hour never occurred to me until a\nfaint sound reached my ears from the veranda out-\nside. Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid\nin his chair. The sound was repeated, and then\nthere came a gentle tap at the door. Milverton rose\nand opened it. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, curtly, \u201cyou are nearly half an\nhour late.\u201d\nSo this was the explanation of the unlocked\ndoor and of the nocturnal vigil of Milverton. There\nwas the gentle rustle of a woman\u2019s dress. I had\nclosed the slit between the curtains as Milverton\u2019s\nface had turned in our direction, but now I ven-\ntured very carefully to open it once more. He had\nresumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an in-\nsolent angle from the corner of his mouth. In front\nof him, in the full glare of the electric light, there\nstood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over her face,\na mantle drawn round her chin. Her breath came\nquick and fast, and every inch of the lithe \ufb01gure\nwas quivering with strong emotion. \u201cWell,\u201d said Milverton, \u201cyou\u2019ve made me lose\na good night\u2019s rest, my dear.

If the\nCountess is a hard mistress you have your chance\nto get level with her now. Bless the girl, what are\nyou shivering about? That\u2019s right! Pull yourself\ntogether! Now, let us get down to business.\u201d He\ntook a note from the drawer of his desk. \u201cYou say\nthat you have \ufb01ve letters which compromise the\nCountess d\u2019Albert. You want to sell them. I want\nto buy them. So far so good. It only remains to\n\ufb01x a price. I should want to inspect the letters, of\ncourse. If they are really good specimens\u2014Great\nheavens, is it you?\u201d\nThe woman without a word had raised her veil\nand dropped the mantle from her chin. It was a\ndark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted\nMilverton, a face with a curved nose, strong,\ndark eyebrows shading hard, glittering eyes, and\na straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a dangerous\nsmile. \u201cIt is I,\u201d she said; \u201cthe woman whose life you\nhave ruined.\u201d\nMilverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his\nvoice. \u201cYou were so very obstinate,\u201d said he. \u201cWhy\ndid you drive me to such extremities? I assure you\n504\nThe Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\nI wouldn\u2019t hurt a \ufb02y of my own accord, but every\nman has his business, and what was I to do?

The woman looked at him\nintently and ground her heel into his upturned\nface. She looked again, but there was no sound\nor movement. I heard a sharp rustle, the night air\nblew into the heated room, and the avenger was\ngone. No interference upon our part could have\nsaved the man from his fate; but as the woman\npoured bullet after bullet into Milverton\u2019s shrink-\ning body I was about to spring out, when I felt\nHolmes\u2019s cold, strong grasp upon my wrist. I\nunderstood the whole argument of that \ufb01rm, re-\nstraining grip\u2014that it was no affair of ours; that\njustice had overtaken a villain; that we had our\nown duties and our own objects which were not\nto be lost sight of. But hardly had the woman\nrushed from the room when Holmes, with swift,\nsilent steps, was over at the other door. He turned\nthe key in the lock. At the same instant we heard\nvoices in the house and the sound of hurrying\nfeet. The revolver shots had roused the house-\nhold. With perfect coolness Holmes slipped across\nto the safe, \ufb01lled his two arms with bundles of let-\nters, and poured them all into the \ufb01re. Again and\nagain he did it, until the safe was empty. Some-\none turned the handle and beat upon the outside\nof the door. Holmes looked swiftly round. The\nletter which had been the messenger of death for\nMilverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the\ntable. Holmes tossed it in among the blazing pa-\npers."

The whole garden was alive with people, and\none fellow raised a view-halloa as we emerged\nfrom the veranda and followed hard at our heels.

No article\nof value was taken, as it is probable that the crimi-\nnals were men of good position, whose sole object\nwas to prevent social exposure.\u201d\n\u201cCriminals!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPlural!\u201d\n\u201cYes, there were two of them.

The assistant had\nleft the front shop for an instant when he heard a\ncrash, and hurrying in he found a plaster bust of\nNapoleon, which stood with several other works\nof art upon the counter, lying shivered into frag-\nments. He rushed out into the road, but, although\nseveral passers-by declared that they had noticed\na man run out of the shop, he could neither see\nanyone nor could he \ufb01nd any means of identify-\ning the rascal. It seemed to be one of those sense-\nless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to\ntime, and it was reported to the constable on the\nbeat as such. The plaster cast was not worth more\nthan a few shillings, and the whole affair appeared\nto be too childish for any particular investigation. \u201dThe second case, however, was more serious\nand also more singular. It occurred only last night. \u201cIn Kennington Road, and within a few hun-\ndred yards of Morse Hudson\u2019s shop, there lives a\nwell-known medical practitioner, named Dr. Bar-\nnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon\nthe south side of the Thames. His residence and\nprincipal consulting-room is at Kennington Road,\nbut he has a branch surgery and dispensary at\nLower Brixton Road, two miles away. This Dr. Bar-\nnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and\nhis house is full of books, pictures, and relics of\nthe French Emperor.

Well, when Dr. Barnicot came down this\nmorning he was astonished to \ufb01nd that his house\nhad been burgled during the night, but that noth-\ning had been taken save the plaster head from the\nhall. It had been carried out and had been dashed\nsavagely against the garden wall, under which its\nsplintered fragments were discovered.\u201d\nHolmes rubbed his hands. \u201cThis is certainly very novel,\u201d said he. \u201cI thought it would please you.

Dr. Barnicot was due at his\nsurgery at twelve o\u2019clock, and you can imagine\nhis amazement when, on arriving there, he found\nthat the window had been opened in the night,\nand that the broken pieces of his second bust were\nstrewn all over the room.

Now,\nMr. Holmes, you have got the facts.\u201d\n\u201cThey are singular, not to say grotesque,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cMay I ask whether the two busts\n509\nThe Adventure of the Six Napoleons\nsmashed in Dr. Barnicot\u2019s rooms were the ex-\nact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in\nMorse Hudson\u2019s shop?\u201d\n\u201cThey were taken from the same mould.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a fact must tell against the theory that\nthe man who breaks them is in\ufb02uenced by any\ngeneral hatred of Napoleon.

So, although, as you say, there are many\nhundreds of statues in London, it is very probable\nthat these three were the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local fanatic would begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?\u201d\n\u201cThere are no limits to the possibilities of\nmonomania,\u201d I answered. \u201cThere is the condi-\ntion which the modern French psychologists have\ncalled the \u2018id\u00b4ee \ufb01xe,\u2019 which may be tri\ufb02ing in char-\nacter, and accompanied by complete sanity in ev-\nery other way.

For example, in Dr.\nBarnicot\u2019s hall, where a sound might arouse the\nfamily, the bust was taken outside before being\nbroken, whereas in the surgery, where there was\nless danger of an alarm, it was smashed where it\nstood. The affair seems absurdly tri\ufb02ing, and yet\nI dare call nothing trivial when I re\ufb02ect that some\nof my most classic cases have had the least promis-\ning commencement. You will remember, Watson,\nhow the dreadful business of the Abernetty family\nwas \ufb01rst brought to my notice by the depth which\nthe parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot\nday. I can\u2019t afford, therefore, to smile at your three\nbroken busts, Lestrade, and I shall be very much\nobliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh\ndevelopments of so singular a chain of events.\u201d\nThe development for which my friend had\nasked came in a quicker and an in\ufb01nitely more\ntragic form than he could have imagined. I was\nstill dressing in my bedroom next morning when\nthere was a tap at the door and Holmes entered, a\ntelegram in his hand. He read it aloud:\n\u201cCome\ninstantly,\n131,\nPitt\nStreet,\nKensington. \u2014 \u201cLestrade.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d I asked. \u201cDon\u2019t know\u2014may be anything. But I suspect\nit is the sequel of the story of the statues. In that\ncase our friend, the image-breaker, has begun op-\nerations in another quarter of London. There\u2019s cof-\nfee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the\ndoor.\u201d\nIn half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a\nquiet little backwater just beside one of the brisk-\nest currents of London life. No. 131 was one of a\nrow, all \ufb02at-chested, respectable, and most unro-\nmantic dwellings. As we drove up we found the\nrailings in front of the house lined by a curious\ncrowd. Holmes whistled. \u201cBy George! it\u2019s attempted murder at the\nleast. Nothing less will hold the London message-\nboy. There\u2019s a deed of violence indicated in that\nfellow\u2019s round shoulders and outstretched neck. What\u2019s this, Watson? The top steps swilled down\nand the other ones dry. Footsteps enough, any-\nhow! Well, well, there\u2019s Lestrade at the front win-\ndow, and we shall soon know all about it.\u201d\nThe of\ufb01cial received us with a very grave face\nand showed us into a sitting-room, where an ex-\nceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly man, clad\nin a \ufb02annel dressing-gown, was pacing up and\ndown. He was introduced to us as the owner of the\nhouse\u2014Mr. Horace Harker, of the Central Press\nSyndicate. \u201cIt\u2019s the Napoleon bust business again,\u201d said\nLestrade. \u201cYou seemed interested last night, Mr.\nHolmes, so I thought perhaps you would be glad\nto be present now that the affair has taken a very\nmuch graver turn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has it turned to, then?\u201d\n\u201cTo murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gen-\ntlemen exactly what has occurred?\u201d\nThe man in the dressing-gown turned upon us\nwith a most melancholy face."

If I had come in\nhere as a journalist I should have interviewed my-\nself and had two columns in every evening paper. 510\nThe Adventure of the Six Napoleons\nAs it is I am giving away valuable copy by telling\nmy story over and over to a string of different peo-\nple, and I can make no use of it myself. However,\nI\u2019ve heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and\nif you\u2019ll only explain this queer business I shall be\npaid for my trouble in telling you the story.\u201d\nHolmes sat down and listened. \u201cIt all seems to centre round that bust of\nNapoleon which I bought for this very room about\nfour months ago. I picked it up cheap from Hard-\ning Brothers, two doors from the High Street Sta-\ntion. A great deal of my journalistic work is done\nat night, and I often write until the early morn-\ning. So it was to-day. I was sitting in my den,\nwhich is at the back of the top of the house, about\nthree o\u2019clock, when I was convinced that I heard\nsome sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were\nnot repeated, and I concluded that they came from\noutside. Then suddenly, about \ufb01ve minutes later,\nthere came a most horrible yell\u2014the most dreadful\nsound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring\nin my ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with hor-\nror for a minute or two. Then I seized the poker\nand went downstairs. When I entered this room\nI found the window wide open, and I at once ob-\nserved that the bust was gone from the mantel-\npiece. Why any burglar should take such a thing\npasses my understanding, for it was only a plaster\ncast and of no real value whatever. \u201cYou can see for yourself that anyone going out\nthrough that open window could reach the front\ndoorstep by taking a long stride. This was clearly\nwhat the burglar had done, so I went round and\nopened the door. Stepping out into the dark I\nnearly fell over a dead man who was lying there. I ran back for a light, and there was the poor fel-\nlow, a great gash in his throat and the whole place\nswimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees\ndrawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see\nhim in my dreams. I had just time to blow on my\npolice-whistle, and then I must have fainted, for\nI knew nothing more until I found the policeman\nstanding over me in the hall.\u201d\n\u201cWell, who was the murdered man?\u201d asked\nHolmes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to show who he was,\u201d said\nLestrade. \u201cYou shall see the body at the mortuary,\nbut we have made nothing of it up to now."

A horn-handled clasp knife\nwas lying in a pool of blood beside him. Whether\nit was the weapon which did the deed, or whether\nit belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There\nwas no name on his clothing, and nothing in his\npockets save an apple, some string, a shilling map\nof London, and a photograph. Here it is.\u201d\nIt was evidently taken by a snap-shot from\na small camera. It represented an alert, sharp-\nfeatured simian man with thick eyebrows, and a\nvery peculiar projection of the lower part of the\nface like the muzzle of a baboon. \u201cAnd\nwhat\nbecame\nof\nthe\nbust?\u201d\nasked\nHolmes, after a careful study of this picture. \u201cWe had news of it just before you came.

I must just take one look round.\u201d\nHe examined the carpet and the window. \u201cThe\nfellow had either very long legs or was a most ac-\ntive man,\u201d said he. \u201cWith an area beneath, it was\nno mean feat to reach that window-ledge and open\nthat window.

Are you coming with us to see the remains of\nyour bust, Mr. Harker?\u201d\nThe disconsolate journalist had seated himself\nat a writing-table. \u201cI must try and make something of it,\u201d said he,\n\u201cthough I have no doubt that the \ufb01rst editions of\nthe evening papers are out already with full de-\ntails. It\u2019s like my luck! You remember when the\nstand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only jour-\nnalist in the stand, and my journal the only one\nthat had no account of it, for I was too shaken to\nwrite it. And now I\u2019ll be too late with a murder\ndone on my own doorstep.\u201d\nAs we left the room we heard his pen travelling\nshrilly over the foolscap. The spot where the fragments of the bust had\nbeen found was only a few hundred yards away. For the \ufb01rst time our eyes rested upon this present-\nment of the great Emperor, which seemed to raise\nsuch frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of\nthe unknown. It lay scattered in splintered shards\nupon the grass. Holmes picked up several of them\nand examined them carefully. I was convinced\nfrom his intent face and his purposeful manner\nthat at last he was upon a clue. \u201cWell?\u201d asked Lestrade. Holmes shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWe have a long way to go yet,\u201d said he. \u201cAnd\nyet\u2014and yet\u2014well, we have some suggestive facts\nto act upon. The possession of this tri\ufb02ing bust\nwas worth more in the eyes of this strange crim-\ninal than a human life. That is one point."

He hardly knew what he was doing.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s likely enough. But I wish to call\nyour attention very particularly to the position of\nthis house in the garden of which the bust was de-\nstroyed.\u201d\nLestrade looked about him. \u201cIt was an empty house, and so he knew that\nhe would not be disturbed in the garden.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but there is another empty house farther\nup the street which he must have passed before he\ncame to this one. Why did he not break it there,\nsince it is evident that every yard that he carried it\nincreased the risk of someone meeting him?\u201d\n\u201cI give it up,\u201d said Lestrade. Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our\nheads. \u201cHe could see what he was doing here and he\ncould not there.

What\nsteps do you propose to take now, Lestrade?\u201d\n\u201cThe most practical way of getting at it, in my\nopinion, is to identify the dead man. There should\nbe no dif\ufb01culty about that. When we have found\nwho he is and who his associates are, we should\nhave a good start in learning what he was doing\nin Pitt Street last night, and who it was who met\nhim and killed him on the doorstep of Mr. Horace\nHarker.

I suggest that you go on your line and I on\nmine. We can compare notes afterwards, and each\nwill supplement the other.\u201d\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cIf you are going back to Pitt Street you might\nsee Mr. Horace Harker. Tell him from me that\nI have quite made up my mind, and that it is\ncertain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic with\nNapoleonic delusions was in his house last night. It will be useful for his article.\u201d\nLestrade stared. \u201cYou don\u2019t seriously believe that?\u201d\nHolmes smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t I? Well, perhaps I don\u2019t. But I am sure\nthat it will interest Mr. Horace Harker and the\nsubscribers of the Central Press Syndicate. Now,\nWatson, I think that we shall \ufb01nd that we have\na long and rather complex day\u2019s work before us.

Until then, good-bye\nand good luck!\u201d\nSherlock Holmes and I walked together to the\nHigh Street, where he stopped at the shop of Hard-\ning Brothers, whence the bust had been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding\nwould be absent until after noon, and that he was\nhimself a newcomer who could give us no infor-\nmation. Holmes\u2019s face showed his disappointment\nand annoyance. \u201cWell, well, we can\u2019t expect to have it all our\nown way, Watson,\u201d he said, at last. \u201cWe must come\nback in the afternoon if Mr. Harding will not be\nhere until then.

Yes, I do,\n512\nThe Adventure of the Six Napoleons\nthough. Why, it\u2019s Beppo. He was a kind of Ital-\nian piece-work man, who made himself useful in\nthe shop. He could carve a bit and gild and frame,\nand do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and\nI\u2019ve heard nothing of him since. No, I don\u2019t know\nwhere he came from nor where he went to. I have\nnothing against him while he was here. He was\ngone two days before the bust was smashed.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all we could reasonably expect\nto get from Morse Hudson,\u201d said Holmes, as we\nemerged from the shop. \u201cWe have this Beppo as a\ncommon factor, both in Kennington and in Kens-\nington, so that is worth a ten-mile drive."

I shall be surprised\nif we don\u2019t get some help down there.\u201d\nIn rapid succession we passed through the\nfringe of fashionable London, hotel London, the-\natrical London, literary London, commercial Lon-\ndon, and, \ufb01nally, maritime London, till we came\nto a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls,\nwhere the tenement houses swelter and reek with\nthe outcasts of Europe. Here, in a broad thorough-\nfare, once the abode of wealthy City merchants, we\nfound the sculpture works for which we searched. Outside was a considerable yard full of monumen-\ntal masonry. Inside was a large room in which \ufb01fty\nworkers were carving or moulding. The manager,\na big blond German, received us civilly, and gave a\nclear answer to all Holmes\u2019s questions. A reference\nto his books showed that hundreds of casts had\nbeen taken from a marble copy of Devine\u2019s head\nof Napoleon, but that the three which had been\nsent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been\nhalf of a batch of six, the other three being sent to\nHarding Brothers, of Kensington. There was no\nreason why those six should be different to any of\nthe other casts. He could suggest no possible cause\nwhy anyone should wish to destroy them\u2014in fact,\nhe laughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was\nsix shillings, but the retailer would get twelve or\nmore. The cast was taken in two moulds from\neach side of the face, and then these two pro\ufb01les\nof plaster of Paris were joined together to make the\ncomplete bust. The work was usually done by Ital-\nians in the room we were in. When \ufb01nished the\nbusts were put on a table in the passage to dry,\nand afterwards stored. That was all he could tell\nus. But the production of the photograph had a\nremarkable effect upon the manager. His face\n\ufb02ushed with anger, and his brows knotted over his\nblue Teutonic eyes. \u201cAh, the rascal!\u201d he cried. \u201cYes, indeed, I know\nhim very well. This has always been a respectable\nestablishment, and the only time that we have ever\nhad the police in it was over this very fellow. It was\nmore than a year ago now. He knifed another Ital-\nian in the street, and then he came to the works\nwith the police on his heels, and he was taken\nhere. Beppo was his name\u2014his second name I\nnever knew. Serve me right for engaging a man\nwith such a face. But he was a good workman,\none of the best.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he get?\u201d\n\u201cThe man lived and he got off with a year. I\nhave no doubt he is out now; but he has not dared\nto show his nose here. We have a cousin of his\nhere, and I dare say he could tell you where he is.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Holmes, \u201cnot a word to the\ncousin\u2014not a word, I beg you."

Mr. Horace Harker is a cus-\ntomer of ours. We supplied him with the bust\nsome months ago. We ordered three busts of that\nsort from Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all\nsold now. To whom?

Well, this\ndead man had some Catholic emblem round his\nneck, and that, along with his colour, made me\nthink he was from the South. Inspector Hill knew\nhim the moment he caught sight of him. His name\nis Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the\ngreatest cut-throats in London. He is connected\nwith the Ma\ufb01a, which, as you know, is a secret\npolitical society, enforcing its decrees by murder. Now you see how the affair begins to clear up. The other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a\nmember of the Ma\ufb01a. He has broken the rules in\nsome fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Proba-\nbly the photograph we found in his pocket is the\nman himself, so that he may not knife the wrong\nperson. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a\nhouse, he waits outside for him, and in the scuf-\n\ufb02e he receives his own death-wound.

In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you\nwould ring for an express messenger, for I have a\n514\nThe Adventure of the Six Napoleons\nletter to send, and it is important that it should go\nat once.\u201d\nHolmes\nspent\nthe\nevening\nin\nrummaging\namong the \ufb01les of the old daily papers with which\none of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at\nlast he descended it was with triumph in his eyes,\nbut he said nothing to either of us as to the result\nof his researches. For my own part, I had followed\nstep by step the methods by which he had traced\nthe various windings of this complex case, and,\nthough I could not yet perceive the goal which we\nwould reach, I understood clearly that Holmes ex-\npected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt\nupon the two remaining busts, one of which, I re-\nmembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object\nof our journey was to catch him in the very act, and\nI could not but admire the cunning with which my\nfriend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening pa-\nper, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could\ncontinue his scheme with impunity. I was not sur-\nprised when Holmes suggested that I should take\nmy revolver with me. He had himself picked up\nthe loaded hunting-crop which was his favourite\nweapon. A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and\nin it we drove to a spot at the other side of Ham-\nmersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was directed\nto wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded\nroad fringed with pleasant houses, each standing\nin its own grounds. In the light of a street lamp\nwe read \u201cLaburnum Villa\u201d upon the gate-post of\none of them."

The wooden fence which sep-\narated the grounds from the road threw a dense\nblack shadow upon the inner side, and here it was\nthat we crouched. \u201cI fear that you\u2019ll have a long wait,\u201d Holmes\nwhispered. \u201cWe may thank our stars that it is\nnot raining. I don\u2019t think we can even venture to\nsmoke to pass the time. However, it\u2019s a two to one\nchance that we get something to pay us for our\ntrouble.\u201d\nIt proved, however, that our vigil was not to\nbe so long as Holmes had led us to fear, and it\nended in a very sudden and singular fashion. In\nan instant, without the least sound to warn us of\nhis coming, the garden gate swung open, and a\nlithe, dark \ufb01gure, as swift and active as an ape,\nrushed up the garden path. We saw it whisk past\nthe light thrown from over the door and disappear\nagainst the black shadow of the house. There was\na long pause, during which we held our breath,\nand then a very gentle creaking sound came to our\nears. The window was being opened. The noise\nceased, and again there was a long silence. The\nfellow was making his way into the house. We\nsaw the sudden \ufb02ash of a dark lantern inside the\nroom. What he sought was evidently not there, for\nagain we saw the \ufb02ash through another blind, and\nthen through another. \u201cLet us get to the open window. We will nab\nhim as he climbs out,\u201d Lestrade whispered. But before we could move the man had\nemerged again. As he came out into the glimmer-\ning patch of light we saw that he carried some-\nthing white under his arm. He looked stealthily\nall round him. The silence of the deserted street\nreassured him. Turning his back upon us he laid\ndown his burden, and the next instant there was\nthe sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter\nand rattle. The man was so intent upon what he\nwas doing that he never heard our steps as we\nstole across the grass plot. With the bound of a\ntiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later\nLestrade and I had him by either wrist and the\nhandcuffs had been fastened. As we turned him\nover I saw a hideous, sallow face, with writhing,\nfurious features, glaring up at us, and I knew that\nit was indeed the man of the photograph whom\nwe had secured. But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes\nwas giving his attention. Squatted on the doorstep,\nhe was engaged in most carefully examining that\nwhich the man had brought from the house. It was\na bust of Napoleon like the one which we had seen\nthat morning, and it had been broken into similar\nfragments."

His name, it appeared, was Beppo, sec-\nond name unknown. He was a well-known ne\u2019er-\ndo-well among the Italian colony. He had once\nbeen a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest\nliving, but he had taken to evil courses and had\ntwice already been in jail\u2014once for a petty theft\nand once, as we had already heard, for stabbing\na fellow-countryman."

To all this information, much of\nwhich we already knew, Holmes listened with po-\nlite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could\nclearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I\ndetected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and ex-\npectation beneath that mask which he was wont to\nassume. At last he started in his chair and his eyes\nbrightened. There had been a ring at the bell. A\nminute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an\nelderly, red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers\nwas ushered in.

He began by taking a clean white cloth\nfrom a drawer and laying it over the table. Then\nhe placed his newly-acquired bust in the centre of\nthe cloth. Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop\n516\nThe Adventure of the Six Napoleons\nand struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of\nthe head. The \ufb01gure broke into fragments, and\nHolmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains. Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph, he held\nup one splinter, in which a round, dark object was\n\ufb01xed like a plum in a pudding. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he cried, \u201clet me introduce you\nto the famous black pearl of the Borgias.\u201d\nLestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and\nthen, with a spontaneous impulse, we both broke\nout clapping as at the well-wrought crisis of a play. A \ufb02ush of colour sprang to Holmes\u2019s pale cheeks,\nand he bowed to us like the master dramatist who\nreceives the homage of his audience. It was at\nsuch moments that for an instant he ceased to\nbe a reasoning machine, and betrayed his human\nlove for admiration and applause. The same sin-\ngularly proud and reserved nature which turned\naway with disdain from popular notoriety was ca-\npable of being moved to its depths by spontaneous\nwonder and praise from a friend. \u201cYes, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cit is the most fa-\nmous pearl now existing in the world, and it has\nbeen my good fortune, by a connected chain of in-\nductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of\nColonna\u2019s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it\nwas lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six\nbusts of Napoleon which were manufactured by\nGelder & Co., of Stepney. You will remember,\nLestrade, the sensation caused by the disappear-\nance of this valuable jewel, and the vain efforts of\nthe London police to recover it. I was myself con-\nsulted upon the case; but I was unable to throw\nany light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the maid of\nthe Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved\nthat she had a brother in London, but we failed to\ntrace any connection between them. The maid\u2019s\nname was Lucretia Venucci, and there is no doubt\nin my mind that this Pietro who was murdered\ntwo nights ago was the brother. I have been look-\ning up the dates in the old \ufb01les of the paper, and\nI \ufb01nd that the disappearance of the pearl was ex-\nactly two days before the arrest of Beppo for some\ncrime of violence, an event which took place in the\nfactory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when\nthese busts were being made. Now you clearly see\nthe sequence of events, though you see them, of\ncourse, in the inverse order to the way in which\nthey presented themselves to me."

It is of no consequence to us which is the\ncorrect solution. \u201cThe main fact is that he had the pearl, and\nat that moment, when it was on his person, he\nwas pursued by the police. He made for the fac-\ntory in which he worked, and he knew that he\nhad only a few minutes in which to conceal this\nenormously valuable prize, which would other-\nwise be found on him when he was searched. Six\nplaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the pas-\nsage. One of them was still soft. In an instant\nBeppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in\nthe wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a\nfew touches covered over the aperture once more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one could\npossibly \ufb01nd it. But Beppo was condemned to a\nyear\u2019s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six\nbusts were scattered over London. He could not\ntell which contained his treasure. Only by break-\ning them could he see. Even shaking would tell\nhim nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was\nprobable that the pearl would adhere to it\u2014as, in\nfact, it has done. Beppo did not despair, and he\nconducted his search with considerable ingenuity\nand perseverance. Through a cousin who works\nwith Gelder he found out the retail \ufb01rms who had\nbought the busts. He managed to \ufb01nd employ-\nment with Morse Hudson, and in that way tracked\ndown three of them. The pearl was not there. Then, with the help of some Italian employe, he suc-\nceeded in \ufb01nding out where the other three busts\nhad gone. The \ufb01rst was at Harker\u2019s. There he was\ndogged by his confederate, who held Beppo re-\nsponsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed\nhim in the scuf\ufb02e which followed.\u201d\n\u201cIf he was his confederate why should he carry\nhis photograph?\u201d I asked. \u201cAs a means of tracing him if he wished to in-\nquire about him from any third person. That was\nthe obvious reason. Well, after the murder I calcu-\nlated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than\ndelay his movements. He would fear that the po-\nlice would read his secret, and so he hastened on\nbefore they should get ahead of him. Of course, I\ncould not say that he had not found the pearl in\nHarker\u2019s bust. I had not even concluded for cer-\ntain that it was the pearl; but it was evident to me\nthat he was looking for something, since he carried\nthe bust past the other houses in order to break it\nin the garden which had a lamp overlooking it. Since Harker\u2019s bust was one in three the chances\nwere exactly as I told you, two to one against the\npearl being inside it."

I am one of the examiners. My subject is Greek, and the \ufb01rst of the papers\nconsists of a large passage of Greek translation\nwhich the candidate has not seen.

No one knew.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is Bannister now?\u201d\n\u201cHe was very ill, poor fellow. I left him col-\nlapsed in the chair. I was in such a hurry to come\nto you.\u201d\n\u201cYou left your door open?\u201d\n\u201cI locked up the papers \ufb01rst.\u201d\n\u201cThen it amounts to this, Mr. Soames, that un-\nless the Indian student recognised the roll as being\nproofs, the man who tampered with them came\nupon them accidentally without knowing that they\nwere there.\u201d\n\u201cSo it seems to me.\u201d\nHolmes gave an enigmatic smile. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201clet us go round. Not one\nof your cases, Watson\u2014mental, not physical. All\nright; come if you want to. Now, Mr. Soames\u2014at\nyour disposal!\u201d\nThe sitting-room of our client opened by a long,\nlow, latticed window on to the ancient lichen-\ntinted court of the old college. A Gothic arched\ndoor led to a worn stone staircase. On the ground\n\ufb02oor was the tutor\u2019s room. Above were three\nstudents, one on each story. It was already twi-\nlight when we reached the scene of our problem. Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the win-\ndow. Then he approached it, and, standing on tip-\ntoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room. \u201cHe must have entered through the door. There\nis no opening except the one pane,\u201d said our\nlearned guide. \u201cDear me!\u201d said Holmes, and he smiled in a\nsingular way as he glanced at our companion. \u201cWell, if there is nothing to be learned here we\nhad best go inside.\u201d\n522\nThe Adventure of the Three Students\nThe lecturer unlocked the outer door and ush-\nered us into his room."

Your servant seems to have quite recovered. You\nleft him in a chair, you say; which chair?\u201d\n\u201cBy the window there.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Near this little table. You can come in\nnow. I have \ufb01nished with the carpet. Let us take\nthe little table \ufb01rst. Of course, what has happened\nis very clear. The man entered and took the papers,\nsheet by sheet, from the central table. He carried\nthem over to the window table, because from there\nhe could see if you came across the courtyard, and\nso could effect an escape.\u201d\n\u201cAs a matter of fact he could not,\u201d said Soames,\n\u201cfor I entered by the side door.\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s good! Well, anyhow, that was in his\nmind. Let me see the three strips. No \ufb01nger im-\npressions\u2014no! Well, he carried over this one \ufb01rst\nand he copied it. How long would it take him to\ndo that, using every possible contraction? A quar-\nter of an hour, not less. Then he tossed it down and\nseized the next. He was in the midst of that when\nyour return caused him to make a very hurried\nretreat\u2014very hurried, since he had not time to re-\nplace the papers which would tell you that he had\nbeen there. You were not aware of any hurrying\nfeet on the stair as you entered the outer door?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say I was.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he wrote so furiously that he broke his\npencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it\nagain. This is of interest, Watson. The pencil was\nnot an ordinary one. It was above the usual size,\nwith a soft lead; the outer colour was dark blue,\nthe maker\u2019s name was printed in silver lettering,\nand the piece remaining is only about an inch and\na half long. Look for such a pencil, Mr. Soames,\nand you have got your man. When I add that he\npossesses a large and very blunt knife, you have\nan additional aid.\u201d\nMr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by\nthis \ufb02ood of information. \u201cI can follow the other\npoints,\u201d said he, \u201cbut really, in this matter of the\nlength\u2014\u201d\nHolmes held out a small chip with the letters\nNN and a space of clear wood after them. \u201cYou see?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I fear that even now\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWatson, I have always done you an injustice. There are others. What could this NN be? It is\nat the end of a word. You are aware that Johann\nFaber is the most common maker\u2019s name. Is it not\nclear that there is just as much of the pencil left\nas usually follows the Johann?\u201d He held the small\ntable sideways to the electric light. \u201cI was hoping\nthat if the paper on which he wrote was thin some\ntrace of it might come through upon this polished\nsurface."

Roughly pyra-\nmidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As\nyou say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this is very interesting. And the cut\u2014a\npositive tear, I see. It began with a thin scratch and\nended in a jagged hole. I am much indebted to you\nfor directing my attention to this case, Mr. Soames. Where does that door lead to?\u201d\n\u201cTo my bedroom.\u201d\n\u201cHave you been in it since your adventure?\u201d\n\u201cNo; I came straight away for you.\u201d\n\u201cI should like to have a glance round. What a\ncharming, old-fashioned room! Perhaps you will\nkindly wait a minute until I have examined the\n\ufb02oor. No, I see nothing. What about this curtain? You hang your clothes behind it. If anyone were\nforced to conceal himself in this room he must do\nit there, since the bed is too low and the wardrobe\ntoo shallow. No one there, I suppose?\u201d\nAs Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from\nsome little rigidity and alertness of his attitude,\nthat he was prepared for an emergency. As a mat-\nter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but\nthree or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of\npegs. Holmes turned away and stooped suddenly\nto the \ufb02oor. \u201cHalloa! What\u2019s this?\u201d said he. It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like\nstuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the\nstudy. Holmes held it out on his open palm in\nthe glare of the electric light. \u201cYour visitor seems to have left traces in your\nbedroom as well as in your sitting-room, Mr.\nSoames.\u201d\n\u201cWhat could he have wanted there?\u201d\n\u201cI think it is clear enough. You came back by an\nunexpected way, and so he had no warning until\nyou were at the very door. What could he do? He\ncaught up everything which would betray him and\nhe rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.\u201d\n\u201cGood gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to\ntell me that all the time I was talking to Bannister\n523\nThe Adventure of the Three Students\nin this room we had the man prisoner if we had\nonly known it?\u201d\n\u201cSo I read it.\u201d\n\u201cSurely\nthere\nis\nanother\nalternative,\nMr.\nHolmes. I don\u2019t know whether you observed my\nbedroom window?\u201d\n\u201cLattice-paned, lead framework, three sepa-\nrate windows, one swinging on hinge and large\nenough to admit a man.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. And it looks out on an angle of the\ncourtyard so as to be partly invisible. The man\nmight have effected his entrance there, left traces\nas he passed through the bedroom, and, \ufb01nally,\n\ufb01nding the door open have escaped that way.\u201d\nHolmes shook his head impatiently. \u201cLet us be practical,\u201d said he. \u201cI understand\nyou to say that there are three students who use\nthis stair and are in the habit of passing your\ndoor?\u201d\n\u201cYes, there are.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they are all in for this examination?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHave you any reason to suspect any one of\nthem more than the others?\u201d\nSoames hesitated."

I will look after the\nproofs.\u201c\n\u201cI will tell you, then, in a few words the charac-\nter of the three men who inhabit these rooms. The\nlower of the three is Gilchrist, a \ufb01ne scholar and\nathlete; plays in the Rugby team and the cricket\nteam for the college, and got his Blue for the hur-\ndles and the long jump. He is a \ufb01ne, manly fellow. His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist,\nwho ruined himself on the turf. My scholar has\nbeen left very poor, but he is hard-working and\nindustrious. He will do well. \u201cThe second \ufb02oor is inhabited by Daulat Ras,\nthe Indian. He is a quiet, inscrutable fellow, as\nmost of those Indians are. He is well up in his\nwork, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is\nsteady and methodical. \u201cThe top \ufb02oor belongs to Miles McLaren. He\nis a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work\u2014one\nof the brightest intellects of the University, but he\nis wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled. He was\nnearly expelled over a card scandal in his \ufb01rst year. He has been idling all this term, and he must look\nforward with dread to the examination.\u201d\n\u201cThen it is he whom you suspect?\u201d\n\u201cI dare not go so far as that. But of the three he\nis perhaps the least unlikely.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look\nat your servant, Bannister.\u201d\nHe was a little,\nwhite-faced,\nclean-shaven,\ngrizzly-haired fellow of \ufb01fty. He was still suffering\nfrom this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine\nof his life. His plump face was twitching with his\nnervousness, and his \ufb01ngers could not keep still. \u201cWe are investigating this unhappy business,\nBannister,\u201d said his master. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat you left\nyour key in the door?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWas it not very extraordinary that you should\ndo this on the very day when there were these pa-\npers inside?\u201d\n\u201cIt was most unfortunate, sir. But I have occa-\nsionally done the same thing at other times.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you enter the room?\u201d\n\u201cIt was about half-past four. That is Mr.\nSoames\u2019s tea time.\u201d\n\u201cHow long did you stay?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I saw that he was absent I withdrew at\nonce.\u201d\n\u201cDid you look at these papers on the table?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir; certainly not.\u201d\n\u201cHow came you to leave the key in the door?\u201d\n\u201cI had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I\nwould come back for the key. Then I forgot.\u201d\n\u201cHas the outer door a spring lock?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThen it was open all the time?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone in the room could get out?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Mr. Soames returned and called for\nyou, you were very much disturbed?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. Such a thing has never happened dur-\ning the many years that I have been here. I nearly\nfainted, sir.\u201d\n\u201cSo I understand."

Come along, and I will personally conduct you.\u201d\n\u201cNo names,\nplease!\u201d said Holmes,\nas we\nknocked at Gilchrist\u2019s door. A tall, \ufb02axen-haired,\nslim young fellow opened it, and made us wel-\ncome when he understood our errand. There were\nsome really curious pieces of mediaeval domes-\ntic architecture within. Holmes was so charmed\nwith one of them that he insisted on drawing it\non his note-book, broke his pencil, had to borrow\none from our host, and \ufb01nally borrowed a knife to\nsharpen his own. The same curious accident hap-\npened to him in the rooms of the Indian\u2014a silent,\nlittle, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance and\nwas obviously glad when Holmes\u2019s architectural\nstudies had come to an end. I could not see that\nin either case Holmes had come upon the clue for\nwhich he was searching. Only at the third did\nour visit prove abortive. The outer door would\nnot open to our knock, and nothing more substan-\ntial than a torrent of bad language came from be-\nhind it. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. You can go to\nblazes!\u201d roared the angry voice. \u201cTo-morrow\u2019s the\nexam, and I won\u2019t be drawn by anyone.\u201d\n\u201cA rude fellow,\u201d said our guide, \ufb02ushing with\nanger as we withdrew down the stair."

No,\nI see nothing in that. Pencils, too, and knives\u2014all\nwas satisfactory. But that fellow does puzzle me.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, Bannister, the servant.

Up to now you\nmay have spoken the truth, but now I know that\nyou have lied.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s face set in sullen de\ufb01ance. \u201cThere was no man, sir.\u201d\n\u201cCome, come, Bannister!\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir; there was no one.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case you can give us no further infor-\nmation. Would you please remain in the room? Stand over there near the bedroom door. Now,\nSoames, I am going to ask you to have the great\nkindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist,\nand to ask him to step down into yours.\u201d\nAn instant later the tutor returned, bringing\nwith him the student. He was a \ufb01ne \ufb01gure of\na man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step\nand a pleasant, open face. His troubled blue eyes\nglanced at each of us, and \ufb01nally rested with an\nexpression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the\nfarther corner. \u201cJust close the door,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, Mr.\nGilchrist, we are all quite alone here, and no one\nneed ever know one word of what passes between\nus. We can be perfectly frank with each other. We want to know, Mr. Gilchrist, how you, an hon-\nourable man, ever came to commit such an action\nas that of yesterday?\u201d\nThe unfortunate young man staggered back\nand cast a look full of horror and reproach at Ban-\nnister. \u201cNo, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir; I never said a\nword\u2014never one word!\u201d cried the servant. \u201cNo, but you have now,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow,\nsir, you must see that after Bannister\u2019s words your\nposition is hopeless, and that your only chance lies\nin a frank confession.\u201d\nFor a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand,\ntried to control his writhing features. The next he\nhad thrown himself on his knees beside the table\nand, burying his face in his hands, he had burst\ninto a storm of passionate sobbing. \u201cCome, come,\u201d said Holmes, kindly; \u201cit is hu-\nman to err, and at least no one can accuse you of\nbeing a callous criminal."

Listen, and see that I do you no injustice. \u201cFrom the moment, Mr. Soames, that you said\nto me that no one, not even Bannister, could have\ntold that the papers were in your room, the case\nbegan to take a de\ufb01nite shape in my mind. The\nprinter one could, of course, dismiss. He could ex-\namine the papers in his own of\ufb01ce. The Indian I\nalso thought nothing of. If the proofs were in a\nroll he could not possibly know what they were. On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coin-\ncidence that a man should dare to enter the room,\nand that by chance on that very day the papers\nwere on the table. I dismissed that. The man who\nentered knew that the papers were there. How did\nhe know? \u201cWhen I approached your room I examined the\nwindow. You amused me by supposing that I was\ncontemplating the possibility of someone having\nin broad daylight, under the eyes of all these op-\nposite rooms, forced himself through it. Such an\nidea was absurd. I was measuring how tall a man\nwould need to be in order to see as he passed\nwhat papers were on the central table. I am six\nfeet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one\nless than that would have a chance. Already you\nsee I had reason to think that if one of your three\nstudents was a man of unusual height he was the\nmost worth watching of the three. \u201cI entered and I took you into my con\ufb01dence\nas to the suggestions of the side table. Of the cen-\ntre table I could make nothing, until in your de-\nscription of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a\nlong-distance jumper. Then the whole thing came\nto me in an instant, and I only needed certain cor-\nroborative proofs, which I speedily obtained. \u201cWhat happened was this. This young fel-\nlow had employed his afternoon at the athletic\ngrounds, where he had been practising the jump. He returned carrying his jumping shoes, which are\nprovided, as you are aware, with several sharp\nspikes. As he passed your window he saw, by\nmeans of his great height, these proofs upon your\ntable, and conjectured what they were. No harm\nwould have been done had it not been that as he\npassed your door he perceived the key which had\nbeen left by the carelessness of your servant. A\nsudden impulse came over him to enter and see if\nthey were indeed the proofs. It was not a danger-\nous exploit, for he could always pretend that he\nhad simply looked in to ask a question. 527\n\u201cWell, when he saw that they were indeed the\nproofs, it was then that he yielded to temptation."

Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. \u201cHe\nput his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs,\nsheet by sheet, to copy them. He thought the\ntutor must return by the main gate, and that he\nwould see him. As we know, he came back by\nthe side gate. Suddenly he heard him at the very\ndoor. There was no possible escape. He forgot his\ngloves, but he caught up his shoes and darted into\nthe bedroom. You observe that the scratch on that\ntable is slight at one side, but deepens in the direc-\ntion of the bedroom door. That in itself is enough\nto show us that the shoe had been drawn in that di-\nrection and that the culprit had taken refuge there. The earth round the spike had been left on the ta-\nble, and a second sample was loosened and fell\nin the bedroom. I may add that I walked out to\nthe athletic grounds this morning, saw that tena-\ncious black clay is used in the jumping-pit, and\ncarried away a specimen of it, together with some\nof the \ufb01ne tan or sawdust which is strewn over it\nto prevent the athlete from slipping.

I have a letter\nhere, Mr. Soames, which I wrote to you early this\nmorning in the middle of a restless night. It was\nbefore I knew that my sin had found me out. Here\nit is, sir. You will see that I have said, \u2018I have deter-\nmined not to go in for the examination. I have been\noffered a commission in the Rhodesian Police, and\nI am going out to South Africa at once.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cI am indeed pleased to hear that you did not\nintend to pro\ufb01t by your unfair advantage,\u201d said\nSoames. \u201cBut why did you change your purpose?\u201d\nGilchrist pointed to Bannister. \u201cThere is the man who set me in the right\npath,\u201d said he. \u201cCome now, Bannister,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt will\nbe clear to you from what I have said that only\nyou could have let this young man out, since you\nwere left in the room, and must have locked the\ndoor when you went out. As to his escaping by\nthat window, it was incredible. Can you not clear\nup the last point in this mystery, and tell us the\nreasons for your action?\u201d\n\u201cIt was simple enough, sir, if you only had\nknown; but with all your cleverness it was impos-\nsible that you could know. Time was, sir, when\nI was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young\ngentleman\u2019s father. When he was ruined I came to\nthe college as servant, but I never forgot my old\nemployer because he was down in the world."

As\nI turn over the pages I see my notes upon the\nrepulsive story of the red leech and the terrible\ndeath of Crosby the banker. Here also I \ufb01nd an\naccount of the Addleton tragedy and the singu-\nlar contents of the ancient British barrow. The fa-\nmous Smith-Mortimer succession case comes also\nwithin this period, and so does the tracking and\narrest of Huret, the Boulevard assassin\u2014an ex-\nploit which won for Holmes an autograph letter\nof thanks from the French President and the Order\nof the Legion of Honour. Each of these would fur-\nnish a narrative, but on the whole I am of opinion\nthat none of them unite so many singular points of\ninterest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place, which\nincludes not only the lamentable death of young\nWilloughby Smith, but also those subsequent de-\nvelopments which threw so curious a light upon\nthe causes of the crime. It was a wild, tempestuous night towards the\nclose of November.

I walked to the win-\ndow and looked out on the deserted street. The oc-\ncasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy\nroad and shining pavement. A single cab was\nsplashing its way from the Oxford Street end. \u201cWell, Watson, it\u2019s as well we have not to turn\nout to-night,\u201d said Holmes, laying aside his lens\nand rolling up the palimpsest. \u201cI\u2019ve done enough\nfor one sitting.

The story, so far as I can make it out,\nis like this. Some years ago this country house,\nYoxley Old Place, was taken by an elderly man,\nwho gave the name of Professor Coram. He was\nan invalid, keeping his bed half the time, and the\nother half hobbling round the house with a stick\nor being pushed about the grounds by the gar-\ndener in a bath-chair. He was well liked by the\nfew neighbours who called upon him, and he has\nthe reputation down there of being a very learned\nman. His household used to consist of an elderly\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Marker, and of a maid, Susan\nTarlton. These have both been with him since his\narrival, and they seem to be women of excellent\ncharacter. The Professor is writing a learned book,\nand he found it necessary about a year ago to en-\ngage a secretary. The \ufb01rst two that he tried were\nnot successes; but the third, Mr. Willoughby Smith,\na very young man straight from the University,\nseems to have been just what his employer wanted. His work consisted in writing all the morning to\nthe Professor\u2019s dictation, and he usually spent\nthe evening in hunting up references and pas-\nsages which bore upon the next day\u2019s work. This\nWilloughby Smith has nothing against him either\nas a boy at Uppingham or as a young man at Cam-\nbridge. I have seen his testimonials, and from the\n\ufb01rst he was a decent, quiet, hardworking fellow,\nwith no weak spot in him at all. And yet this is\nthe lad who has met his death this morning in the\nProfessor\u2019s study under circumstances which can\npoint only to murder.\u201d\nThe wind howled and screamed at the win-\ndows. Holmes and I drew closer to the \ufb01re while\nthe young inspector slowly and point by point de-\nveloped his singular narrative. \u201cIf you were to search all England,\u201d said he,\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could \ufb01nd a household\nmore self-contained or free from outside in\ufb02u-\nences."

Young Smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood,\nand lived very much as his employer did. The two\nwomen had nothing to take them from the house. Mortimer the gardener, who wheels the bath-chair,\nis an Army pensioner\u2014an old Crimean man of ex-\ncellent character. He does not live in the house, but\nin a three-roomed cottage at the other end of the\ngarden. Those are the only people that you would\n\ufb01nd within the grounds of Yoxley Old Place. At\nthe same time, the gate of the garden is a hundred\nyards from the main London to Chatham road. It\nopens with a latch, and there is nothing to prevent\nanyone from walking in. \u201cNow I will give you the evidence of Susan\nTarlton, who is the only person who can say any-\nthing positive about the matter. It was in the\nforenoon, between eleven and twelve. She was en-\ngaged at the moment in hanging some curtains in\nthe upstairs front bedroom. Professor Coram was\nstill in bed, for when the weather is bad he sel-\ndom rises before midday. The housekeeper was\nbusied with some work in the back of the house. Willoughby Smith had been in his bedroom, which\nhe uses as a sitting-room; but the maid heard him\nat that moment pass along the passage and de-\nscend to the study immediately below her. She\ndid not see him, but she says that she could not\nbe mistaken in his quick, \ufb01rm tread. She did not\nhear the study door close, but a minute or so later\nthere was a dreadful cry in the room below. It was\na wild, hoarse scream, so strange and unnatural\nthat it might have come either from a man or a\nwoman. At the same instant there was a heavy\nthud, which shook the old house, and then all\nwas silence. The maid stood petri\ufb01ed for a mo-\nment, and then, recovering her courage, she ran\ndownstairs. The study door was shut, and she\nopened it. Inside young Mr. Willoughby Smith\nwas stretched upon the \ufb02oor. At \ufb01rst she could\nsee no injury, but as she tried to raise him she\nsaw that blood was pouring from the underside of\nhis neck. It was pierced by a very small but very\ndeep wound, which had divided the carotid artery. The instrument with which the injury had been in-\n\ufb02icted lay upon the carpet beside him. It was one\nof those small sealing-wax knives to be found on\nold-fashioned writing-tables, with an ivory handle\nand a stiff blade. It was part of the \ufb01ttings of the\nProfessor\u2019s own desk. \u201cAt \ufb01rst the maid thought that young Smith\nwas already dead, but on pouring some water\nfrom the carafe over his forehead he opened his\neyes for an instant. \u2018The Professor,\u2019 he mur-\nmured\u2014\u2018it was she.\u2019\nThe maid is prepared to\nswear that those were the exact words."

Leaving\n532\nThe Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez\nSusan with the body, she hurried to the Profes-\nsor\u2019s room. He was sitting up in bed horribly ag-\nitated, for he had heard enough to convince him\nthat something terrible had occurred.

What sort of job did you make of\nit?\u201d\n\u201cI must ask you \ufb01rst, Mr. Holmes, to glance\nat this rough plan, which will give you a general\nidea of the position of the Professor\u2019s study and\nthe various points of the case. It will help you in\nfollowing my investigation.\u201d\nHe unfolded the rough chart, which I here re-\nproduce, and he laid it across Holmes\u2019s knee. I\nrose, and, standing behind Holmes, I studied it\nover his shoulder. \u201cIt is very rough, of course, and it only deals\nwith the points which seem to me to be essential. All the rest you will see later for yourself. Now,\n\ufb01rst of all, presuming that the assassin entered the\nhouse, how did he or she come in? Undoubtedly\nby the garden path and the back door, from which\nthere is direct access to the study. Any other way\nwould have been exceedingly complicated. The es-\ncape must have also been made along that line,\nfor of the two other exits from the room one was\nblocked by Susan as she ran downstairs and the\nother leads straight to the Professor\u2019s bedroom. I\ntherefore directed my attention at once to the gar-\nden path, which was saturated with recent rain\nand would certainly show any footmarks. \u201cMy examination showed me that I was deal-\ning with a cautious and expert criminal."

Well, well, it can\u2019t be\nhelped. What did you do, Hopkins, after you had\nmade certain that you had made certain of noth-\ning?\u201d\n\u201cI think I made certain of a good deal, Mr.\nHolmes. I knew that someone had entered the\nhouse cautiously from without. I next examined\nthe corridor. It is lined with cocoanut matting and\nhad taken no impression of any kind. This brought\nme into the study itself. It is a scantily-furnished\nroom. The main article is a large writing-table with\na \ufb01xed bureau. This bureau consists of a dou-\nble column of drawers with a central small cup-\nboard between them. The drawers were open, the\ncupboard locked. The drawers, it seems, were al-\nways open, and nothing of value was kept in them. There were some papers of importance in the cup-\nboard, but there were no signs that this had been\ntampered with, and the Professor assures me that\nnothing was missing. It is certain that no robbery\nhas been committed. \u201cI come now to the body of the young man. It\nwas found near the bureau, and just to the left of\nit, as marked upon that chart. The stab was on the\n533\nThe Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez\nright side of the neck and from behind forwards,\nso that it is almost impossible that it could have\nbeen self-in\ufb02icted.\u201d\n\u201cUnless he fell upon the knife,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cExactly. The idea crossed my mind. But we\nfound the knife some feet away from the body, so\nthat seems impossible. Then, of course, there are\nthe man\u2019s own dying words. And, \ufb01nally, there\nwas this very important piece of evidence which\nwas found clasped in the dead man\u2019s right hand.\u201d\nFrom his pocket Stanley Hopkins drew a small\npaper packet."

He held them on his nose, endeavoured\nto read through them, went to the window and\nstared up the street with them, looked at them\nmost minutely in the full light of the lamp, and\n\ufb01nally, with a chuckle, seated himself at the table\nand wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper, which\nhe tossed across to Stanley Hopkins. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I can do for you,\u201d said he. \u201cIt\nmay prove to be of some use.\u201d\nThe astonished detective read the note aloud. It ran as follows:\n\u201cWanted, a woman of good address,\nattired like a lady. She has a remark-\nably thick nose, with eyes which are\nset close upon either side of it. She\nhas a puckered forehead, a peering ex-\npression, and probably rounded shoul-\nders. There are indications that she\nhas had recourse to an optician at least\ntwice during the last few months. As\nher glasses are of remarkable strength\nand as opticians are not very numer-\nous, there should be no dif\ufb01culty in\ntracing her.\u201d\nHolmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins,\nwhich must have been re\ufb02ected upon my features. \u201cSurely my deductions are simplicity itself,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cIt would be dif\ufb01cult to name any arti-\ncles which afford a \ufb01ner \ufb01eld for inference than a\npair of glasses, especially so remarkable a pair as\nthese. That they belong to a woman I infer from\ntheir delicacy, and also, of course, from the last\nwords of the dying man. As to her being a per-\nson of re\ufb01nement and well dressed, they are, as\nyou perceive, handsomely mounted in solid gold,\nand it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such\nglasses could be slatternly in other respects. You\nwill \ufb01nd that the clips are too wide for your nose,\nshowing that the lady\u2019s nose was very broad at\nthe base. This sort of nose is usually a short and\ncoarse one, but there are a suf\ufb01cient number of\nexceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or\nfrom insisting upon this point in my description. My own face is a narrow one, and yet I \ufb01nd that I\ncannot get my eyes into the centre, or near the cen-\ntre, of these glasses. Therefore the lady\u2019s eyes are\nset very near to the sides of the nose. You will per-\nceive, Watson, that the glasses are concave and of\nunusual strength. A lady whose vision has been so\nextremely contracted all her life is sure to have the\nphysical characteristics of such vision, which are\nseen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the shoul-\nders.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI can follow each of your argu-\nments."

One of these is discoloured and\nworn to some slight extent, but the other is new. Evidently one has fallen off and been replaced. I\nshould judge that the older of them has not been\nthere more than a few months.

I think that you know\nas much as I do now\u2014probably more. We have\nhad inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the\ncountry roads or at the railway station. We have\nheard of none.

There\u2019s a train from Charing Cross to Chatham at\nsix in the morning, and we should be at Yoxley\nOld Place between eight and nine.\u201d\n\u201cThen we shall take it. Your case has certainly\nsome features of great interest, and I shall be de-\nlighted to look into it. Well, it\u2019s nearly one, and we\nhad best get a few hours\u2019 sleep. I dare say you can\nmanage all right on the sofa in front of the \ufb01re. I\u2019ll\nlight my spirit-lamp and give you a cup of coffee\nbefore we start.\u201d\nThe gale had blown itself out next day, but it\nwas a bitter morning when we started upon our\njourney. We saw the cold winter sun rise over the\ndreary marshes of the Thames and the long, sullen\nreaches of the river, which I shall ever associate\nwith our pursuit of the Andaman Islander in the\nearlier days of our career. After a long and weary\njourney we alighted at a small station some miles\nfrom Chatham. While a horse was being put into a\ntrap at the local inn we snatched a hurried break-\nfast, and so we were all ready for business when\nwe at last arrived at Yoxley Old Place. A constable\nmet us at the garden gate. \u201cWell, Wilson, any news?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, nothing.\u201d\n\u201cNo reports of any stranger seen?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir. Down at the station they are certain\nthat no stranger either came or went yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cHave you had inquiries made at inns and\nlodgings?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir; there is no one that we cannot account\nfor.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s only a reasonable walk to Chatham."

The\nidea of murder was not in her mind, or she would\nhave provided herself with some sort of weapon,\ninstead of having to pick this knife off the writing-\ntable. She advanced along this corridor, leaving no\ntraces upon the cocoanut matting. Then she found\nherself in this study. How long was she there?

Just hold\na match, Watson. Why did you not tell me of this,\nHopkins?\u201d\nThe mark which he was examining began upon\nthe brass work on the right-hand side of the key-\nhole, and extended for about four inches, where it\nhad scratched the varnish from the surface. \u201cI noticed it, Mr. Holmes. But you\u2019ll always\n\ufb01nd scratches round a keyhole.\u201d\n\u201cThis is recent, quite recent. See how the brass\nshines where it is cut. An old scratch would be the\nsame colour as the surface. Look at it through my\nlens. There\u2019s the varnish, too, like earth on each\nside of a furrow. Is Mrs. Marker there?\u201d\nA sad-faced, elderly woman came into the\nroom. \u201cDid you dust this bureau yesterday morn-\ning?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cDid you notice this scratch?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, I did not.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure you did not, for a duster would have\nswept away these shreds of varnish."

Mrs. Marker, you can go. Now we\nare making a little progress. Our lady enters the\nroom, advances to the bureau, and either opens it\nor tries to do so. While she is thus engaged young\nWilloughby Smith enters the room. In her hurry\nto withdraw the key she makes this scratch upon\nthe door. He seizes her, and she, snatching up\nthe nearest object, which happens to be this knife,\nstrikes at him in order to make him let go his hold. The blow is a fatal one. He falls and she escapes,\neither with or without the object for which she has\ncome. Is Susan the maid there?

It was a very large chamber, lined with innu-\nmerable volumes, which had over\ufb02owed from the\nshelves and lay in piles in the corners, or were\nstacked all round at the base of the cases. The\nbed was in the centre of the room, and in it,\npropped up with pillows, was the owner of the\nhouse. I have seldom seen a more remarkable-\nlooking person. It was a gaunt, aquiline face which\nwas turned towards us, with piercing dark eyes,\nwhich lurked in deep hollows under overhung and\ntufted brows. His hair and beard were white, save\nthat the latter was curiously stained with yellow\naround his mouth. A cigarette glowed amid the\ntangle of white hair, and the air of the room was\nfetid with stale tobacco-smoke. As he held out his\nhand to Holmes I perceived that it also was stained\nyellow with nicotine. \u201cA smoker, Mr. Holmes?\u201d said he, speaking\nwell-chosen English with a curious little mincing\naccent."

He was more attentive when\nSusan, who waited upon us at lunch, volunteered\nthe information that she believed Mr. Smith had\nbeen out for a walk yesterday morning, and that he\nhad only returned half an hour before the tragedy\noccurred. I could not myself see the bearing of this\nincident, but I clearly perceived that Holmes was\nweaving it into the general scheme which he had\nformed in his brain. Suddenly he sprang from his\nchair and glanced at his watch. \u201cTwo o\u2019clock, gen-\ntlemen,\u201d said he. \u201cWe must go up and have it out\nwith our friend the Professor.\u201d\nThe old man had just \ufb01nished his lunch, and\ncertainly his empty dish bore evidence to the good\nappetite with which his housekeeper had credited\nhim.

I was my-\nself in my room, and I never left it during the day.\u201d\n\u201cI am aware of that, Professor Coram.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you mean to say that I could lie upon that\nbed and not be aware that a woman had entered\nmy room?\u201d\n\u201cI never said so.

Where is she now?\u201d\n\u201cShe is there,\u201d said Holmes, and he pointed to\na high bookcase in the corner of the room. I saw the old man throw up his arms, a ter-\nrible convulsion passed over his grim face, and\nhe fell back in his chair. At the same instant the\nbookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round\nupon a hinge, and a woman rushed out into the\nroom. \u201cYou are right!\u201d she cried, in a strange for-\neign voice. \u201cYou are right! I am here.\u201d\nShe was brown with the dust and draped with\nthe cobwebs which had come from the walls of\nher hiding-place. Her face, too, was streaked with\ngrime, and at the best she could never have been\nhandsome, for she had the exact physical charac-\nteristics which Holmes had divined, with, in ad-\ndition, a long and obstinate chin. What with her\nnatural blindness, and what with the change from\ndark to light, she stood as one dazed, blinking\nabout her to see where and who we were. And yet,\nin spite of all these disadvantages, there was a cer-\ntain nobility in the woman\u2019s bearing, a gallantry in\nthe de\ufb01ant chin and in the upraised head, which\ncompelled something of respect and admiration. Stanley Hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm\nand claimed her as his prisoner, but she waved him\naside gently, and yet with an overmastering dig-\nnity which compelled obedience. The old man lay\nback in his chair, with a twitching face, and stared\nat her with brooding eyes. \u201cYes, sir, I am your prisoner,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom\nwhere I stood I could hear everything, and I know\nthat you have learned the truth. I confess it all. It was I who killed the young man. But you are\nright, you who say it was an accident. I did not\neven know that it was a knife which I held in my\nhand, for in my despair I snatched anything from\nthe table and struck at him to make him let me go. It is the truth that I tell.\u201d\n\u201cMadam,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI am sure that it is\nthe truth."

But I must speak\nor I shall be too late. \u201cI have said, gentlemen, that I am this man\u2019s\nwife. He was \ufb01fty and I a foolish girl of twenty\nwhen we married.

Then\nthere came a time of trouble, a police of\ufb01cer was\nkilled, many were arrested, evidence was wanted,\nand in order to save his own life and to earn a great\nreward my husband betrayed his own wife and his\ncompanions. Yes, we were all arrested upon his\nconfession. Some of us found our way to the gal-\nlows and some to Siberia. I was among these last,\nbut my term was not for life. My husband came to\nEngland with his ill-gotten gains, and has lived in\nquiet ever since, knowing well that if the Brother-\nhood knew where he was not a week would pass\nbefore justice would be done.\u201d\nThe old man reached out a trembling hand and\nhelped himself to a cigarette. \u201cI am in your hands,\nAnna,\u201d said he. \u201cYou were always good to me.\u201d\n\u201cI have not yet told you the height of his vil-\nlainy,\u201d said she. \u201cAmong our comrades of the Or-\nder there was one who was the friend of my heart. He was noble, unsel\ufb01sh, loving\u2014all that my hus-\nband was not. He hated violence. We were all\nguilty\u2014if that is guilt\u2014but he was not. He wrote\nfor ever dissuading us from such a course. These\nletters would have saved him. So would my diary,\nin which from day to day I had entered both my\nfeelings towards him and the view which each of\nus had taken. My husband found and kept both\ndiary and letters. He hid them, and he tried hard\nto swear away the young man\u2019s life. In this he\nfailed, but Alexis was sent a convict to Siberia,\nwhere now, at this moment, he works in a salt\nmine."

Yet I was sure that with his\nrevengeful nature he would never give it to me of\nhis own free will. I must get it for myself. With\nthis object I engaged an agent from a private de-\ntective \ufb01rm, who entered my husband\u2019s house as\nsecretary\u2014it was your second secretary, Sergius,\nthe one who left you so hurriedly.

He furnished me with a plan of the house, and he\ntold me that in the forenoon the study was always\nempty, as the secretary was employed up here. So\nat last I took my courage in both hands and I came\ndown to get the papers for myself. I succeeded,\nbut at what a cost! \u201cI had just taken the papers and was locking\nthe cupboard when the young man seized me. I\nhad seen him already that morning.

He spoke of giving me up. I showed him that if he did so his life was in my\nhands. If he gave me to the law I could give him\nto the Brotherhood. It was not that I wished to\nlive for my own sake, but it was that I desired to\naccomplish my purpose. He knew that I would\ndo what I said\u2014that his own fate was involved in\nmine."

I took the poison before I left my hiding-\nplace. My head swims! I am going! I charge you,\nsir, to remember the packet.\u201d\n\u201cA simple case, and yet in some ways an in-\nstructive one,\u201d Holmes remarked, as we travelled\nback to town. \u201cIt hinged from the outset upon the\npince-nez. But for the fortunate chance of the dy-\ning man having seized these I am not sure that\nwe could ever have reached our solution. It was\nclear to me from the strength of the glasses that\nthe wearer must have been very blind and help-\nless when deprived of them. When you asked me\nto believe that she walked along a narrow strip of\ngrass without once making a false step I remarked,\nas you may remember, that it was a noteworthy\nperformance. In my mind I set it down as an\nimpossible performance, save in the unlikely case\nthat she had a second pair of glasses. I was forced,\ntherefore, to seriously consider the hypothesis that\nshe had remained within the house. On perceiving\nthe similarity of the two corridors it became clear\nthat she might very easily have made such a mis-\ntake, and in that case it was evident that she must\nhave entered the Professor\u2019s room. I was keenly\non the alert, therefore, for whatever would bear\nout this supposition, and I examined the room nar-\nrowly for anything in the shape of a hiding-place. The carpet seemed continuous and \ufb01rmly nailed,\nso I dismissed the idea of a trap-door. There might\nwell be a recess behind the books. As you are\naware, such devices are common in old libraries. I observed that books were piled on the \ufb02oor at\nall other points, but that one bookcase was left\nclear. This, then, might be the door. I could see\nno marks to guide me, but the carpet was of a dun\ncolour, which lends itself very well to examination. I therefore smoked a great number of those excel-\nlent cigarettes, and I dropped the ash all over the\nspace in front of the suspected bookcase."

I won-\nder my hair isn\u2019t grey. Godfrey Staunton\u2014you\u2019ve\nheard of him, of course? He\u2019s simply the hinge\nthat the whole team turns on. I\u2019d rather spare\ntwo from the pack and have Godfrey for my three-\nquarter line. Whether it\u2019s passing, or tackling, or\ndribbling, there\u2019s no one to touch him; and then,\nhe\u2019s got the head and can hold us all together. What am I to do? That\u2019s what I ask you, Mr.\nHolmes. There\u2019s Moorhouse, \ufb01rst reserve, but he\nis trained as a half, and he always edges right in on\nto the scrum instead of keeping out on the touch-\nline. He\u2019s a \ufb01ne place-kick, it\u2019s true, but, then,\nhe has no judgment, and he can\u2019t sprint for nuts. Why, Morton or Johnson, the Oxford \ufb02iers, could\nromp round him. Stevenson is fast enough, but\nhe couldn\u2019t drop from the twenty-\ufb01ve line, and a\nthree-quarter who can\u2019t either punt or drop isn\u2019t\nworth a place for pace alone. No, Mr. Holmes, we\nare done unless you can help me to \ufb01nd Godfrey\nStaunton.\u201d\nMy friend had listened with amused surprise\nto this long speech, which was poured forth with\nextraordinary vigour and earnestness, every point\nbeing driven home by the slapping of a brawny\nhand upon the speaker\u2019s knee.

Good Lord! Mr. Holmes, where have you\nlived?\u201d\nHolmes laughed at the young giant\u2019s naive as-\ntonishment. \u201cYou live in a different world to me, Mr. Over-\nton, a sweeter and healthier one.

To-\nmorrow we play Oxford. Yesterday we all came up\nand we settled at Bentley\u2019s private hotel. At ten\no\u2019clock I went round and saw that all the fellows\nhad gone to roost, for I believe in strict training\nand plenty of sleep to keep a team \ufb01t. I had a\nword or two with Godfrey before he turned in. He\nseemed to me to be pale and bothered. I asked him\nwhat was the matter. He said he was all right\u2014just\na touch of headache. I bade him good-night and\nleft him. Half an hour later the porter tells me\nthat a rough-looking man with a beard called with\na note for Godfrey. He had not gone to bed and\nthe note was taken to his room. Godfrey read it\nand fell back in a chair as if he had been pole-\naxed. The porter was so scared that he was going\nto fetch me, but Godfrey stopped him, had a drink\nof water, and pulled himself together. Then he\nwent downstairs, said a few words to the man who\nwas waiting in the hall, and the two of them went\noff together. The last that the porter saw of them,\nthey were almost running down the street in the\ndirection of the Strand. This morning Godfrey\u2019s\nroom was empty, his bed had never been slept in,\nand his things were all just as I had seen them the\nnight before. He had gone off at a moment\u2019s no-\ntice with this stranger, and no word has come from\nhim since. I don\u2019t believe he will ever come back. He was a sportsman, was Godfrey, down to his\nmarrow, and he wouldn\u2019t have stopped his train-\ning and let in his skipper if it were not for some\ncause that was too strong for him. No; I feel as if\nhe were gone for good and we should never see\nhim again.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes listened with the deepest at-\ntention to this singular narrative. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he asked. \u201cI wired to Cambridge to learn if anything had\nbeen heard of him there. I have had an answer. No\none has seen him.\u201d\n\u201cCould he have got back to Cambridge?\u201d\n\u201cYes, there is a late train\u2014quarter-past eleven.\u201d\n\u201cBut so far as you can ascertain he did not take\nit?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he has not been seen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you do next?\u201d\n\u201cI wired to Lord Mount-James.\u201d\n\u201cWhy to Lord Mount-James?\u201d\n\u201cGodfrey is an orphan, and Lord Mount-James\nis his nearest relative\u2014his uncle, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. This throws new light upon the mat-\nter. Lord Mount-James is one of the richest men in\nEngland.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard Godfrey say.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your friend was closely related?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he was his heir, and the old boy is nearly\neighty\u2014cram full of gout, too.

I was standing by the door, and he\nwith his back turned at that table. When he had\nwritten it he said, \u2018All right, porter, I will take this\nmyself.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cWhat did he write it with?\u201d\n\u201cA pen, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWas the telegraphic form one of these on the\ntable?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir; it was the top one.\u201d\nHolmes rose. Taking the forms he carried them\nover to the window and carefully examined that\nwhich was uppermost. \u201cIt is a pity he did not write in pencil,\u201d said\nhe, throwing them down again with a shrug of\ndisappointment. \u201cAs you have no doubt fre-\nquently observed, Watson, the impression usually\ngoes through\u2014a fact which has dissolved many\na happy marriage. However, I can \ufb01nd no trace\nhere. I rejoice, however, to perceive that he wrote\nwith a broad-pointed quill pen, and I can hardly\ndoubt that we will \ufb01nd some impression upon\nthis blotting-pad. Ah, yes, surely this is the very\nthing!\u201d\nHe tore off a strip of the blotting-paper and\nturned towards us the following hieroglyphic:\nekas sdoG rof su yb dnatS\nCyril Overton was much excited. \u201cHold it to\nthe glass!\u201d he cried. \u201cThat is unnecessary,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThe pa-\nper is thin, and the reverse will give the message.

Another\nperson was involved. Who should it be but the\npale-faced, bearded man, who seemed himself in\nso nervous a state? What, then, is the connec-\ntion between Godfrey Staunton and the bearded\nman? And what is the third source from which\neach of them sought for help against pressing dan-\nger? Our inquiry has already narrowed down to\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cWe have only to \ufb01nd to whom that telegram\nis addressed,\u201d I suggested. \u201cExactly, my dear Watson. Your re\ufb02ection,\nthough profound, had already crossed my mind. But I dare say it may have come to your notice\nthat if you walk into a post-of\ufb01ce and demand to\nsee the counterfoil of another man\u2019s message there\nmay be some disinclination on the part of the of-\n\ufb01cials to oblige you. There is so much red tape\nin these matters! However, I have no doubt that\n547\nThe Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\nwith a little delicacy and \ufb01nesse the end may be at-\ntained. Meanwhile, I should like in your presence,\nMr. Overton, to go through these papers which\nhave been left upon the table.\u201d\nThere were a number of letters, bills, and note-\nbooks, which Holmes turned over and examined\nwith quick, nervous \ufb01ngers and darting, penetrat-\ning eyes."

The fame\nof your wealth has gone abroad, Lord Mount-\nJames, and it is entirely possible that a gang of\nthieves have secured your nephew in order to gain\nfrom him some information as to your house, your\nhabits, and your treasure.\u201d\nThe face of our unpleasant little visitor turned\nas white as his neckcloth. \u201cHeavens, sir, what an idea! I never thought\nof such villainy! What inhuman rogues there are\nin the world! But Godfrey is a \ufb01ne lad\u2014a staunch\nlad. Nothing would induce him to give his old un-\ncle away. I\u2019ll have the plate moved over to the bank\nthis evening. In the meantime spare no pains, Mr.\nDetective! I beg you to leave no stone unturned to\nbring him safely back.

We\nhad shaken off Lord Mount-James, and Overton\nhad gone to consult with the other members of his\nteam over the misfortune which had befallen them. There was a telegraph-of\ufb01ce at a short distance\nfrom the hotel. We halted outside it. 548\nThe Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth trying, Watson,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cOf\ncourse, with a warrant we could demand to see the\ncounterfoils, but we have not reached that stage\nyet. I don\u2019t suppose they remember faces in so\nbusy a place. Let us venture it.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry to trouble you,\u201d said he, in his\nblandest manner, to the young woman behind the\ngrating; \u201cthere is some small mistake about a tele-\ngram I sent yesterday. I have had no answer, and\nI very much fear that I must have omitted to put\nmy name at the end. Could you tell me if this was\nso?\u201d\nThe young woman turned over a sheaf of coun-\nterfoils. \u201cWhat o\u2019clock was it?\u201d she asked. \u201cA little after six.\u201d\n\u201cWhom was it to?\u201d\nHolmes put his \ufb01nger to his lips and glanced at\nme. \u201cThe last words in it were \u2018for God\u2019s sake,\u2019 \u201d\nhe whispered, con\ufb01dentially; \u201cI am very anxious\nat getting no answer.\u201d\nThe young woman separated one of the forms. \u201cThis is it. There is no name,\u201d said she, smooth-\ning it out upon the counter. \u201cThen that, of course, accounts for my getting\nno answer,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cDear me, how very\nstupid of me, to be sure!

All the indications seem to me to point\nin that direction.\u201d\n\u201cTell me,\u201d I asked, as we rattled up Gray\u2019s Inn\nRoad, \u201chave you any suspicion yet as to the cause\nof the disappearance? I don\u2019t think that among all\nour cases I have known one where the motives are\nmore obscure. Surely you don\u2019t really imagine that\nhe may be kidnapped in order to give information\nagainst his wealthy uncle?\u201d\n\u201cI confess, my dear Watson, that that does not\nappeal to me as a very probable explanation. It\nstruck me, however, as being the one which was\nmost likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant\nold person.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly did that. But what are your alter-\nnatives?\u201d\n\u201cI could mention several. You must admit\nthat it is curious and suggestive that this incident\nshould occur on the eve of this important match,\nand should involve the only man whose presence\nseems essential to the success of the side. It may,\nof course, be coincidence, but it is interesting. Am-\nateur sport is free from betting, but a good deal of\noutside betting goes on among the public, and it\nis possible that it might be worth someone\u2019s while\nto get at a player as the ruf\ufb01ans of the turf get at\na race-horse. There is one explanation. A second\nvery obvious one is that this young man really is\nthe heir of a great property, however modest his\nmeans may at present be, and it is not impossible\nthat a plot to hold him for ransom might be con-\ncocted.\u201d\n\u201cThese theories take no account of the tele-\ngram.\u201d\n\u201cQuite true, Watson. The telegram still remains\nthe only solid thing with which we have to deal,\nand we must not permit our attention to wander\naway from it. It is to gain light upon the purpose\nof this telegram that we are now upon our way\nto Cambridge. The path of our investigation is\nat present obscure, but I shall be very much sur-\nprised if before evening we have not cleared it up\nor made a considerable advance along it.\u201d\nIt was already dark when we reached the old\nUniversity city. Holmes took a cab at the station,\nand ordered the man to drive to the house of Dr.\nLeslie Armstrong. A few minutes later we had\nstopped at a large mansion in the busiest thor-\noughfare. We were shown in, and after a long wait\nwere at last admitted into the consulting-room,\nwhere we found the doctor seated behind his ta-\nble. It argues the degree in which I had lost touch\nwith my profession that the name of Leslie Arm-\nstrong was unknown to me."

Where\nyour calling is more open to criticism is when you\npry into the secrets of private individuals, when\nyou rake up family matters which are better hid-\nden, and when you incidentally waste the time of\nmen who are more busy than yourself. At the\npresent moment, for example, I should be writing\na treatise instead of conversing with you.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt, doctor; and yet the conversation\nmay prove more important than the treatise. In-\ncidentally I may tell you that we are doing the re-\nverse of what you very justly blame, and that we\nare endeavouring to prevent anything like public\nexposure of private matters which must necessar-\nily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands\nof the of\ufb01cial police.

The young man\u2019s fate interests me deeply,\nsince I know him and like him.

This little inn just opposite Armstrong\u2019s\nhouse is singularly adapted to our needs. If you\nwould engage a front room and purchase the nec-\nessaries for the night, I may have time to make a\nfew inquiries.\u201d\n550\nThe Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\nThese few inquiries proved, however, to be a\nmore lengthy proceeding than Holmes had imag-\nined, for he did not return to the inn until nearly\nnine o\u2019clock. He was pale and dejected, stained\nwith dust, and exhausted with hunger and fatigue. A cold supper was ready upon the table, and when\nhis needs were satis\ufb01ed and his pipe alight he was\nready to take that half comic and wholly philo-\nsophic view which was natural to him when his\naffairs were going awry.

He is a lecturer and a consultant, but he does\nnot care for general practice, which distracts him\nfrom his literary work. Why, then, does he make\nthese long journeys, which must be exceedingly\nirksome to him, and who is it that he visits?\u201d\n\u201cHis coachman\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Watson, can you doubt that it was to\nhim that I \ufb01rst applied? I do not know whether it\ncame from his own innate depravity or from the\npromptings of his master, but he was rude enough\nto set a dog at me. Neither dog nor man liked\nthe look of my stick, however, and the matter fell\nthrough. Relations were strained after that, and\nfurther inquiries out of the question. All that I\nhave learned I got from a friendly native in the\nyard of our own inn. It was he who told me of the\ndoctor\u2019s habits and of his daily journey. At that in-\nstant, to give point to his words, the carriage came\nround to the door.\u201d\n\u201cCould you not follow it?\u201d\n\u201cExcellent, Watson! You are scintillating this\nevening. The idea did cross my mind. There is, as\nyou may have observed, a bicycle shop next to our\ninn. Into this I rushed, engaged a bicycle, and was\nable to get started before the carriage was quite out\nof sight. I rapidly overtook it, and then, keeping\nat a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so, I\nfollowed its lights until we were clear of the town. We had got well out on the country road when a\nsomewhat mortifying incident occurred. The car-\nriage stopped, the doctor alighted, walked swiftly\nback to where I had also halted, and told me in an\nexcellent sardonic fashion that he feared the road\nwas narrow, and that he hoped his carriage did not\nimpede the passage of my bicycle. Nothing could\nhave been more admirable than his way of putting\nit. I at once rode past the carriage, and, keeping to\nthe main road, I went on for a few miles, and then\nhalted in a convenient place to see if the carriage\npassed. There was no sign of it, however, and so\nit became evident that it had turned down one of\nseveral side roads which I had observed. I rode\nback, but again saw nothing of the carriage, and\nnow, as you perceive, it has returned after me. Of\ncourse, I had at the outset no particular reason to\nconnect these journeys with the disappearance of\nGodfrey Staunton, and was only inclined to inves-\ntigate them on the general grounds that everything\nwhich concerns Dr. Armstrong is at present of in-\nterest to us; but, now that I \ufb01nd he keeps so keen\na look-out upon anyone who may follow him on\nthese excursions, the affair appears more impor-\ntant, and I shall not be satis\ufb01ed until I have made\nthe matter clear.\u201d\n\u201cWe can follow him to-morrow.\u201d\n\u201cCan we?"

Meanwhile, I can inform\nyou that no spying upon me can in any\n551\nThe Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\nway help Mr. Godfrey Staunton, and I\nam convinced that the best service you\ncan do to that gentleman is to return at\nonce to London and to report to your\nemployer that you are unable to trace\nhim. Your time in Cambridge will cer-\ntainly be wasted. Yours faithfully,\nLeslie Armstrong. \u201cAn outspoken, honest antagonist is the doc-\ntor,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWell, well, he excites my cu-\nriosity, and I must really know more before I leave\nhim.\u201d\n\u201cHis carriage is at his door now,\u201d said I. \u201cThere\nhe is stepping into it. I saw him glance up at our\nwindow as he did so. Suppose I try my luck upon\nthe bicycle?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, my dear Watson! With all respect for\nyour natural acumen I do not think that you are\nquite a match for the worthy doctor. I think that\npossibly I can attain our end by some independent\nexplorations of my own. I am afraid that I must\nleave you to your own devices, as the appearance\nof two inquiring strangers upon a sleepy country-\nside might excite more gossip than I care for. No\ndoubt you will \ufb01nd some sights to amuse you in\nthis venerable city, and I hope to bring back a more\nfavourable report to you before evening.\u201d\nOnce more, however, my friend was destined\nto be disappointed."

Having\ngot the doctor\u2019s general direction, I spent the\nday in visiting all the villages upon that side of\nCambridge, and comparing notes with publicans\nand other local news agencies. I have covered\nsome ground:\nChesterton, Histon, Waterbeach,\nand Oakington have each been explored and have\neach proved disappointing. The daily appearance\nof a brougham and pair could hardly have been\noverlooked in such Sleepy Hollows. The doctor\nhas scored once more. Is there a telegram for me?\u201d\n\u201cYes; I opened it. Here it is:\n\u201c \u2018Ask for Pompey from Jeremy Dixon,\nTrinity College.\u2019\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it is clear enough. It is from our friend\nOverton, and is in answer to a question from me. I\u2019ll just send round a note to Mr. Jeremy Dixon,\nand then I have no doubt that our luck will turn. By the way, is there any news of the match?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the local evening paper has an excellent\naccount in its last edition. Oxford won by a goal\nand two tries. The last sentences of the description\nsay:\n\u201c \u2018The defeat of the Light Blues may be\nentirely attributed to the unfortunate ab-\nsence of the crack International, Godfrey\nStaunton, whose want was felt at every in-\nstant of the game. The lack of combination\nin the three-quarter line and their weak-\nness both in attack and defence more than\nneutralized the efforts of a heavy and hard-\nworking pack.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cThen our friend Overton\u2019s forebodings have been\njusti\ufb01ed,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPersonally I am in agree-\nment with Dr. Armstrong, and football does not\ncome within my horizon. Early to bed to-night,\nWatson, for I foresee that to-morrow may be an\neventful day.\u201d\nI was horri\ufb01ed by my \ufb01rst glimpse of Holmes\nnext morning, for he sat by the \ufb01re holding his\ntiny hypodermic syringe. I associated that instru-\nment with the single weakness of his nature, and\nI feared the worst when I saw it glittering in his\nhand. He laughed at my expression of dismay, and\nlaid it upon the table. \u201cNo, no, my dear fellow, there is no cause for\nalarm. It is not upon this occasion the instrument\nof evil, but it will rather prove to be the key which\nwill unlock our mystery. On this syringe I base\nall my hopes. I have just returned from a small\nscouting expedition and everything is favourable. Eat a good breakfast, Watson, for I propose to get\nupon Dr. Armstrong\u2019s trail to-day, and once on it I\nwill not stop for rest or food until I run him to his\nburrow.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said I, \u201cwe had best carry our\nbreakfast with us, for he is making an early start. His carriage is at the door.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind. Let him go. He will be clever if\nhe can drive where I cannot follow him. When you\nhave \ufb01nished come downstairs with me, and I will\nintroduce you to a detective who is a very eminent\nspecialist in the work that lies before us.\u201d\nWhen we descended I followed Holmes into\nthe stable yard, where he opened the door of a\nloose-box and led out a squat, lop-eared, white-\nand-tan dog, something between a beagle and a\nfoxhound."

Well, Pompey, you may\n552\nThe Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\nnot be fast, but I expect you will be too fast for\na couple of middle-aged London gentlemen, so I\nwill take the liberty of fastening this leather leash\nto your collar. Now, boy, come along, and show\nwhat you can do.\u201d He led him across to the doc-\ntor\u2019s door. The dog sniffed round for an instant,\nand then with a shrill whine of excitement started\noff down the street, tugging at his leash in his ef-\nforts to go faster. In half an hour, we were clear of\nthe town and hastening down a country road. \u201cWhat have you done, Holmes?\u201d I asked. \u201cA threadbare and venerable device, but useful\nupon occasion. I walked into the doctor\u2019s yard this\nmorning and shot my syringe full of aniseed over\nthe hind wheel. A draghound will follow aniseed\nfrom here to John o\u2019 Groat\u2019s, and our friend Arm-\nstrong would have to drive through the Cam be-\nfore he would shake Pompey off his trail. Oh, the\ncunning rascal! This is how he gave me the slip\nthe other night.\u201d\nThe dog had suddenly turned out of the main\nroad into a grass-grown lane. Half a mile farther\nthis opened into another broad road, and the trail\nturned hard to the right in the direction of the\ntown, which we had just quitted. The road took\na sweep to the south of the town and continued in\nthe opposite direction to that in which we started. \u201cThis d\u00b4etour has been entirely for our bene\ufb01t,\nthen?\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNo wonder that my in-\nquiries among those villages led to nothing. The\ndoctor has certainly played the game for all it is\nworth, and one would like to know the reason for\nsuch elaborate deception. This should be the vil-\nlage of Trumpington to the right of us. And, by\nJove! here is the brougham coming round the cor-\nner. Quick, Watson, quick, or we are done!\u201d\nHe sprang through a gate into a \ufb01eld, dragging\nthe reluctant Pompey after him. We had hardly got\nunder the shelter of the hedge when the carriage\nrattled past. I caught a glimpse of Dr. Armstrong\nwithin, his shoulders bowed, his head sunk on his\nhands, the very image of distress. I could tell by\nmy companion\u2019s graver face that he also had seen. \u201cI fear there is some dark ending to our quest,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cIt cannot be long before we know it. Come, Pompey! Ah, it is the cottage in the \ufb01eld!\u201d\nThere could be no doubt that we had reached\nthe end of our journey. Pompey ran about and\nwhined eagerly outside the gate where the marks\nof the brougham\u2019s wheels were still to be seen. A\nfootpath led across to the lonely cottage."

And yet the\ncottage was not deserted, for a low sound came to\nour ears\u2014a kind of drone of misery and despair,\nwhich was indescribably melancholy. Holmes\npaused irresolute, and then he glanced back at the\nroad which we had just traversed. A brougham\nwas coming down it, and there could be no mis-\ntaking those grey horses. \u201cBy Jove, the doctor is coming back!\u201d cried\nHolmes. \u201cThat settles it. We are bound to see what\nit means before he comes.\u201d\nHe opened the door and we stepped into the\nhall. The droning sound swelled louder upon our\nears until it became one long, deep wail of distress. It came from upstairs. Holmes darted up and I\nfollowed him. He pushed open a half-closed door\nand we both stood appalled at the sight before us. A woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead\nupon the bed. Her calm, pale face, with dim,\nwide-opened blue eyes, looked upward from amid\na great tangle of golden hair. At the foot of the\nbed, half sitting, half kneeling, his face buried in\nthe clothes, was a young man, whose frame was\nracked by his sobs. So absorbed was he by his bit-\nter grief that he never looked up until Holmes\u2019s\nhand was on his shoulder. \u201cAre you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes; I am\u2014but you are too late. She is\ndead.\u201d\nThe man was so dazed that he could not\nbe made to understand that we were anything\nbut doctors who had been sent to his assistance. Holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of\nconsolation, and to explain the alarm which had\nbeen caused to his friends by his sudden disap-\npearance, when there was a step upon the stairs,\nand there was the heavy, stern, questioning face of\nDr. Armstrong at the door. \u201cSo, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cyou have attained\nyour end, and have certainly chosen a particularly\ndelicate moment for your intrusion. I would not\nbrawl in the presence of death, but I can assure\nyou that if I were a younger man your monstrous\nconduct would not pass with impunity.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me, Dr. Armstrong, I think we are a\nlittle at cross-purposes,\u201d said my friend, with dig-\nnity. \u201cIf you could step downstairs with us we may\neach be able to give some light to the other upon\nthis miserable affair.\u201d\nA minute later the grim doctor and ourselves\nwere in the sitting-room below. \u201cWell, sir?\u201d said he. 553\n\u201cI wish you to understand, in the \ufb01rst place,\nthat I am not employed by Lord Mount-James,\nand that my sympathies in this matter are entirely\nagainst that nobleman. When a man is lost it is\nmy duty to ascertain his fate, but having done so\nthe matter ends so far as I am concerned; and so\nlong as there is nothing criminal, I am much more\nanxious to hush up private scandals than to give\nthem publicity."

I thank Heaven that my compunction\nat leaving poor Staunton all alone in this plight\ncaused me to turn my carriage back, and so to\nmake your acquaintance. Knowing as much as\nyou do, the situation is very easily explained. A\nyear ago Godfrey Staunton lodged in London for\na time, and became passionately attached to his\nlandlady\u2019s daughter, whom he married. She was\nas good as she was beautiful, and as intelligent as\nshe was good. No man need be ashamed of such a\nwife. But Godfrey was the heir to this crabbed old\nnobleman, and it was quite certain that the news\nof his marriage would have been the end of his in-\nheritance. I knew the lad well, and I loved him for\nhis many excellent qualities. I did all I could to\nhelp him to keep things straight. We did our very\nbest to keep the thing from everyone, for when\nonce such a whisper gets about it is not long be-\nfore everyone has heard it. Thanks to this lonely\ncottage and his own discretion, Godfrey has up to\nnow succeeded. Their secret was known to no one\nsave to me and to one excellent servant who has\nat present gone for assistance to Trumpington. But\nat last there came a terrible blow in the shape of\ndangerous illness to his wife. It was consumption\nof the most virulent kind. The poor boy was half\ncrazed with grief, and yet he had to go to London\nto play this match, for he could not get out of it\nwithout explanations which would expose his se-\ncret. I tried to cheer him up by a wire, and he sent\nme one in reply imploring me to do all I could. This was the telegram which you appear in some\ninexplicable way to have seen. I did not tell him\nhow urgent the danger was, for I knew that he\ncould do no good here, but I sent the truth to the\ngirl\u2019s father, and he very injudiciously communi-\ncated it to Godfrey. The result was that he came\nstraight away in a state bordering on frenzy, and\nhas remained in the same state, kneeling at the end\nof her bed, until this morning death put an end to\nher sufferings. That is all, Mr. Holmes, and I am\nsure that I can rely upon your discretion and that\nof your friend.\u201d\nHolmes grasped the doctor\u2019s hand. \u201cCome, Watson,\u201d said he, and we passed from\nthat house of grief into the pale sunlight of the\nwinter day.

It was not until we had consumed some\nhot tea at the station, and taken our places in the\nKentish train, that we were suf\ufb01ciently thawed, he\nto speak and I to listen.

Your fatal habit of looking at ev-\nerything from the point of view of a story instead\nof as a scienti\ufb01c exercise has ruined what might\nhave been an instructive and even classical series\nof demonstrations.

At present I am,\nas you know, fairly busy, but I propose to devote\nmy declining years to the composition of a text-\nbook which shall focus the whole art of detection\ninto one volume. Our present research appears to\nbe a case of murder.\u201d\n\u201cYou think this Sir Eustace is dead, then?\u201d\n\u201cI should say so. Hopkins\u2019s writing shows con-\nsiderable agitation, and he is not an emotional\nman. Yes, I gather there has been violence, and\nthat the body is left for our inspection. A mere sui-\ncide would not have caused him to send for me. As\nto the release of the lady, it would appear that she\nhas been locked in her room during the tragedy."

I \ufb02ung the curtain aside and found myself\nface to face with a broad-shouldered, elderly man\nwho had just stepped into the room. The window\nis a long French one, which really forms a door\nleading to the lawn.

I must have\nbeen unconscious for a few minutes, for when I\ncame to myself I found that they had torn down\nthe bell-rope and had secured me tightly to the\noaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-\nroom table. I was so \ufb01rmly bound that I could not\nmove, and a handkerchief round my mouth pre-\nvented me from uttering any sound. It was at this\ninstant that my unfortunate husband entered the\nroom.

That is really all that I\ncan tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not\nbe necessary for me to go over so painful a story\nagain.\u201d\n\u201cAny questions, Mr. Holmes?\u201d asked Hopkins. \u201cI will not impose any further tax upon Lady\nBrackenstall\u2019s patience and time,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cBefore I go into the dining-room I should like to\nhear your experience.\u201d He looked at the maid. \u201cI saw the men before ever they came into the\nhouse,\u201d said she. \u201cAs I sat by my bedroom win-\ndow I saw three men in the moonlight down by\nthe lodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it\nat the time. It was more than an hour after that I\nheard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to \ufb01nd\nher, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the\n\ufb02oor with his blood and brains over the room. It\nwas enough to drive a woman out of her wits, tied\nthere, and her very dress spotted with him; but she\nnever wanted courage, did Miss Mary Fraser of\nAdelaide, and Lady Brackenstall of Abbey Grange\nhasn\u2019t learned new ways. You\u2019ve questioned her\nlong enough, you gentlemen, and now she is com-\ning to her own room, just with her old Theresa, to\nget the rest that she badly needs.\u201d\nWith a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman\nput her arm round her mistress and led her from\nthe room. \u201cShe has been with her all her life,\u201d said Hop-\nkins. \u201cNursed her as a baby, and came with her\nto England when they \ufb01rst left Australia eighteen\nmonths ago. Theresa Wright is her name, and the\nkind of maid you don\u2019t pick up nowadays. This\nway, Mr. Holmes, if you please!\u201d\nThe keen interest had passed out of Holmes\u2019s\nexpressive face, and I knew that with the mystery\nall the charm of the case had departed. There still\nremained an arrest to be effected, but what were\nthese commonplace rogues that he should soil his\nhands with them? An abstruse and learned spe-\ncialist who \ufb01nds that he has been called in for a\ncase of measles would experience something of the\nannoyance which I read in my friend\u2019s eyes. Yet\nthe scene in the dining-room of the Abbey Grange\nwas suf\ufb01ciently strange to arrest his attention and\nto recall his waning interest. It was a very large and high chamber, with\ncarved oak ceiling, oaken panelling, and a \ufb01ne ar-\nray of deer\u2019s heads and ancient weapons around\nthe walls. At the farther end from the door was\nthe high French window of which we had heard."

On\nthe left was a large, deep \ufb01replace, with a mas-\nsive, over-hanging oak mantelpiece. Beside the\n\ufb01replace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and\ncross-bars at the bottom. In and out through the\nopen woodwork was woven a crimson cord, which\nwas secured at each side to the crosspiece below. In releasing the lady the cord had been slipped off\nher, but the knots with which it had been secured\nstill remained. These details only struck our at-\ntention afterwards, for our thoughts were entirely\nabsorbed by the terrible object which lay upon the\ntiger-skin hearthrug in front of the \ufb01re. It was the body of a tall, well-made man, about\nforty years of age. He lay upon his back, his face\nupturned, with his white teeth grinning through\nhis short black beard. His two clenched hands\nwere raised above his head, and a heavy black-\nthorn stick lay across them. His dark, handsome,\n559\nThe Adventure of the Abbey Grange\naquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of\nvindictive hatred, which had set his dead face in\na terribly \ufb01endish expression. He had evidently\nbeen in his bed when the alarm had broken out, for\nhe wore a foppish embroidered night-shirt, and his\nbare feet projected from his trousers. His head was\nhorribly injured, and the whole room bore witness\nto the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck\nhim down. Beside him lay the heavy poker, bent\ninto a curve by the concussion. Holmes examined\nboth it and the indescribable wreck which it had\nwrought. \u201cHe must be a powerful man, this elder Ran-\ndall,\u201d he remarked. \u201cYes,\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cI have some record of\nthe fellow, and he is a rough customer.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have no dif\ufb01culty in getting him.\u201d\n\u201cNot the slightest. We have been on the look-\nout for him, and there was some idea that he had\ngot away to America. Now that we know the gang\nare here I don\u2019t see how they can escape. We have\nthe news at every seaport already, and a reward\nwill be offered before evening. What beats me is\nhow they could have done so mad a thing, know-\ning that the lady could describe them, and that we\ncould not fail to recognise the description.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. One would have expected that they\nwould have silenced Lady Brackenstall as well.\u201d\n\u201cThey may not have realized,\u201d I suggested,\n\u201cthat she had recovered from her faint.\u201d\n\u201cThat is likely enough. If she seemed to be\nsenseless they would not take her life. What about\nthis poor fellow, Hopkins? I seem to have heard\nsome queer stories about him.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a good-hearted man when he was\nsober, but a perfect \ufb01end when he was drunk, or\nrather when he was half drunk, for he seldom re-\nally went the whole way. The devil seemed to be\nin him at such times, and he was capable of any-\nthing."

There was a scandal about his drenching a\ndog with petroleum and setting it on \ufb01re\u2014her la-\ndyship\u2019s dog, to make the matter worse\u2014and that\nwas only hushed up with dif\ufb01culty. Then he threw\na decanter at that maid, Theresa Wright; there was\ntrouble about that. On the whole, and between\nourselves, it will be a brighter house without him. What are you looking at now?\u201d\nHolmes was down on his knees examining\nwith great attention the knots upon the red cord\nwith which the lady had been secured. Then he\ncarefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end\nwhere it had snapped off when the burglar had\ndragged it down. \u201cWhen this was pulled down the bell in the\nkitchen must have rung loudly,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNo one could hear it. The kitchen stands right\nat the back of the house.\u201d\n\u201cHow did the burglar know no one would hear\nit? How dared he pull at a bell-rope in that reck-\nless fashion?\u201d\n\u201cExactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly. You put the\nvery question which I have asked myself again\nand again. There can be no doubt that this fel-\nlow must have known the house and its habits. He\nmust have perfectly understood that the servants\nwould all be in bed at that comparatively early\nhour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell\nring in the kitchen. Therefore he must have been\nin close league with one of the servants. Surely\nthat is evident. But there are eight servants, and\nall of good character.\u201d\n\u201cOther things being equal,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cone\nwould suspect the one at whose head the mas-\nter threw a decanter. And yet that would in-\nvolve treachery towards the mistress to whom this\nwoman seems devoted. Well, well, the point is a\nminor one, and when you have Randall you will\nprobably \ufb01nd no dif\ufb01culty in securing his accom-\nplice. The lady\u2019s story certainly seems to be cor-\nroborated, if it needed corroboration, by every de-\ntail which we see before us.\u201d He walked to the\nFrench window and threw it open. \u201cThere are no\nsigns here, but the ground is iron hard, and one\nwould not expect them. I see that these candles on\nthe mantelpiece have been lighted.\u201d\n\u201cYes; it was by their light and that of the lady\u2019s\nbedroom candle that the burglars saw their way\nabout.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did they take?\u201d\n\u201cWell, they did not take much\u2014only half-a-\ndozen articles of plate off the sideboard. Lady\nBrackenstall thinks that they were themselves so\ndisturbed by the death of Sir Eustace that they\ndid not ransack the house as they would otherwise\nhave done.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt that is true. And yet they drank\nsome wine, I understand.\u201d\n\u201cTo steady their own nerves.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. These three glasses upon the side-\nboard have been untouched, I suppose?\u201d\n\u201cYes; and the bottle stands as they left it.\u201d\n\u201cLet us look at it."

The bottle stood\n560\nThe Adventure of the Abbey Grange\nnear them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long,\ndeeply-stained cork. Its appearance and the dust\nupon the bottle showed that it was no common\nvintage which the murderers had enjoyed. A change had come over Holmes\u2019s manner. He\nhad lost his listless expression, and again I saw an\nalert light of interest in his keen, deep-set eyes. He\nraised the cork and examined it minutely. \u201cHow did they draw it?\u201d he asked. Hopkins pointed to a half-opened drawer. In it\nlay some table linen and a large cork-screw. \u201cDid Lady Brackenstall say that screw was\nused?\u201d\n\u201cNo; you remember that she was senseless at\nthe moment when the bottle was opened.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. As a matter of fact that screw was\nnot used. This bottle was opened by a pocket-\nscrew, probably contained in a knife, and not more\nthan an inch and a half long. If you examine the\ntop of the cork you will observe that the screw\nwas driven in three times before the cork was ex-\ntracted. It has never been trans\ufb01xed. This long\nscrew would have trans\ufb01xed it and drawn it with\na single pull. When you catch this fellow you will\n\ufb01nd that he has one of these multiplex knives in\nhis possession.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cBut these glasses do puzzle me, I confess. Lady Brackenstall actually saw the three men\ndrinking, did she not?\u201d\n\u201cYes; she was clear about that.\u201d\n\u201cThen there is an end of it. What more is to\nbe said? And yet you must admit that the three\nglasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. What, you\nsee nothing remarkable! Well, well, let it pass. Per-\nhaps when a man has special knowledge and spe-\ncial powers like my own it rather encourages him\nto seek a complex explanation when a simpler one\nis at hand. Of course, it must be a mere chance\nabout the glasses. Well, good morning, Hopkins. I\ndon\u2019t see that I can be of any use to you, and you\nappear to have your case very clear. You will let\nme know when Randall is arrested, and any fur-\nther developments which may occur. I trust that\nI shall soon have to congratulate you upon a suc-\ncessful conclusion. Come, Watson, I fancy that we\nmay employ ourselves more pro\ufb01tably at home.\u201d\nDuring our return journey I could see by\nHolmes\u2019s face that he was much puzzled by some-\nthing which he had observed. Every now and\nthen, by an effort, he would throw off the impres-\nsion and talk as if the matter were clear, but then\nhis doubts would settle down upon him again, and\nhis knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show\nthat his thoughts had gone back once more to the\ngreat dining-room of the Abbey Grange in which\nthis midnight tragedy had been enacted."

Every instinct that I possess cries out\nagainst it. It\u2019s wrong\u2014it\u2019s all wrong\u2014I\u2019ll swear\nthat it\u2019s wrong. And yet the lady\u2019s story was com-\nplete, the maid\u2019s corroboration was suf\ufb01cient, the\ndetail was fairly exact. What have I to put against\nthat? Three wine-glasses, that is all. But if I had\nnot taken things for granted, if I had examined ev-\nerything with care which I would have shown had\nwe approached the case de novo and had no cut-\nand-dried story to warp my mind, would I not\nthen have found something more de\ufb01nite to go\nupon? Of course I should. Sit down on this bench,\nWatson, until a train for Chislehurst arrives, and\nallow me to lay the evidence before you, imploring\nyou in the \ufb01rst instance to dismiss from your mind\nthe idea that anything which the maid or her mis-\ntress may have said must necessarily be true. The\nlady\u2019s charming personality must not be permitted\nto warp our judgment. \u201cSurely there are details in her story which, if\nwe looked at it in cold blood, would excite our sus-\npicion. These burglars made a considerable haul at\nSydenham a fortnight ago. Some account of them\nand of their appearance was in the papers, and\nwould naturally occur to anyone who wished to\ninvent a story in which imaginary robbers should\nplay a part. As a matter of fact, burglars who have\ndone a good stroke of business are, as a rule, only\ntoo glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet\nwithout embarking on another perilous undertak-\ning. Again, it is unusual for burglars to operate\nat so early an hour; it is unusual for burglars to\nstrike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one\nwould imagine that was the sure way to make her\nscream; it is unusual for them to commit murder\nwhen their numbers are suf\ufb01cient to overpower\none man; it is unusual for them to be content with\na limited plunder when there is much more within\ntheir reach; and \ufb01nally I should say that it was very\nunusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty. How do all these unusuals strike you, Watson?\u201d\n561\nThe Adventure of the Abbey Grange\n\u201cTheir cumulative effect is certainly consider-\nable, and yet each of them is quite possible in it-\nself. The most unusual thing of all, as it seems to\nme, is that the lady should be tied to the chair.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I am not so clear about that, Watson; for\nit is evident that they must either kill her or else\nsecure her in such a way that she could not give\nimmediate notice of their escape."

Does that strike you as likely?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? There was wine in each glass.\u201d\n\u201cExactly; but there was bees-wing only in one\nglass. You must have noticed that fact. What does\nthat suggest to your mind?\u201d\n\u201cThe last glass \ufb01lled would be most likely to\ncontain bees-wing.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. The bottle was full of it, and it is\ninconceivable that the \ufb01rst two glasses were clear\nand the third heavily charged with it. There are\ntwo possible explanations, and only two. One is\nthat after the second glass was \ufb01lled the bottle was\nviolently agitated, and so the third glass received\nthe bees-wing. That does not appear probable. No,\nno; I am sure that I am right.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, then, do you suppose?\u201d\n\u201cThat only two glasses were used, and that the\ndregs of both were poured into a third glass, so as\nto give the false impression that three people had\nbeen here. In that way all the bees-wing would be\nin the last glass, would it not? Yes, I am convinced\nthat this is so. But if I have hit upon the true ex-\nplanation of this one small phenomenon, then in\nan instant the case rises from the commonplace to\nthe exceedingly remarkable, for it can only mean\nthat Lady Brackenstall and her maid have deliber-\nately lied to us, that not one word of their story\nis to be believed, that they have some very strong\nreason for covering the real criminal, and that we\nmust construct our case for ourselves without any\nhelp from them. That is the mission which now\nlies before us, and here, Watson, is the Chislehurst\ntrain.\u201d\nThe household of the Abbey Grange were\nmuch\nsurprised\nat\nour\nreturn,\nbut\nSherlock\nHolmes, \ufb01nding that Stanley Hopkins had gone\noff to report to head-quarters, took possession of\nthe dining-room, locked the door upon the inside,\nand devoted himself for two hours to one of those\nminute and laborious investigations which formed\nthe solid basis on which his brilliant edi\ufb01ces of de-\nduction were reared. Seated in a corner like an\ninterested student who observes the demonstra-\ntion of his professor, I followed every step of that\nremarkable research. The window, the curtains,\nthe carpet, the chair, the rope\u2014each in turn was\nminutely examined and duly pondered. The body\nof the unfortunate baronet had been removed, but\nall else remained as we had seen it in the morning. Then, to my astonishment, Holmes climbed up on\nto the massive mantelpiece. Far above his head\nhung the few inches of red cord which were still\nattached to the wire. For a long time he gazed up-\nward at it, and then in an attempt to get nearer to it\nhe rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the\nwall."

But, dear me, how slow-witted I have\nbeen, and how nearly I have committed the blun-\nder of my lifetime! Now, I think that with a few\nmissing links my chain is almost complete.\u201d\n\u201cYou have got your men?\u201d\n\u201cMan, Watson, man. Only one, but a very\nformidable person.

Six foot three in height,\nactive as a squirrel, dexterous with his \ufb01ngers; \ufb01-\nnally, remarkably quick-witted, for this whole in-\ngenious story is of his concoction.

And yet in that bell-rope he has\ngiven us a clue which should not have left us a\ndoubt.\u201d\n\u201cWhere was the clue?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you were to pull down a bell-rope,\nWatson, where would you expect it to break? Surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire. Why should it break three inches from the top as\nthis one has done?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it is frayed there?\u201d\n\u201cExactly. This end, which we can examine, is\nfrayed. He was cunning enough to do that with his\nknife. But the other end is not frayed. You could\nnot observe that from here, but if you were on the\nmantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off\n562\nThe Adventure of the Abbey Grange\nwithout any mark of fraying whatever. You can\nreconstruct what occurred. The man needed the\nrope. He would not tear it down for fear of giv-\ning the alarm by ringing the bell. What did he do? He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite\nreach it, put his knee on the bracket\u2014you will see\nthe impression in the dust\u2014and so got his knife to\nbear upon the cord. I could not reach the place by\nat least three inches, from which I infer that he is\nat least three inches a bigger man than I. Look at\nthat mark upon the seat of the oaken chair! What\nis it?\u201d\n\u201cBlood.\u201d\n\u201cUndoubtedly it is blood. This alone puts the\nlady\u2019s story out of court. If she were seated on\nthe chair when the crime was done, how comes\nthat mark? No, no; she was placed in the chair\nafter the death of her husband. I\u2019ll wager that the\nblack dress shows a corresponding mark to this. We have not yet met our Waterloo, Watson, but\nthis is our Marengo, for it begins in defeat and\nends in victory.

He lived at Sydenham,\nbut he was likely to be in that morning for instruc-\ntions, if we cared to wait for him. No; Mr. Holmes had no desire to see him, but\nwould be glad to know more about his record and\ncharacter. His record was magni\ufb01cent. There was not an\nof\ufb01cer in the \ufb02eet to touch him. As to his character,\nhe was reliable on duty, but a wild, desperate fel-\nlow off the deck of his ship, hot-headed, excitable,\nbut loyal, honest, and kind-hearted. That was the\npith of the information with which Holmes left\nthe of\ufb01ce of the Adelaide-Southampton company. Thence he drove to Scotland Yard, but instead of\nentering he sat in his cab with his brows drawn\ndown, lost in profound thought. Finally he drove\nround to the Charing Cross telegraph of\ufb01ce, sent\noff a message, and then, at last, we made for Baker\nStreet once more."

Once\nor twice in my career I feel that I have done more\nreal harm by my discovery of the criminal than\never he had done by his crime. I have learned cau-\ntion now, and I had rather play tricks with the law\nof England than with my own conscience. Let us\nknow a little more before we act.\u201d\nBefore evening we had a visit from Inspector\nStanley Hopkins. Things were not going very well\nwith him. \u201cI believe that you are a wizard, Mr. Holmes. I really do sometimes think that you have powers\nthat are not human. Now, how on earth could you\nknow that the stolen silver was at the bottom of\nthat pond?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\u201cBut you told me to examine it.\u201d\n\u201cYou got it, then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I got it.\u201d\n\u201cI am very glad if I have helped you.\u201d\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t helped me. You have made\nthe affair far more dif\ufb01cult. What sort of burglars\nare they who steal silver and then throw it into the\nnearest pond?\u201d\n\u201cIt was certainly rather eccentric behaviour. I\nwas merely going on the idea that if the silver\nhad been taken by persons who did not want it,\nwho merely took it for a blind as it were, then they\nwould naturally be anxious to get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cBut why should such an idea cross your\nmind?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I thought it was possible. When they\ncame out through the French window there was\nthe pond, with one tempting little hole in the ice,\nright in front of their noses. Could there be a better\nhiding-place?\u201d\n\u201cAh, a hiding-place\u2014that is better!\u201d cried Stan-\nley Hopkins. \u201cYes, yes, I see it all now! It was\nearly, there were folk upon the roads, they were\nafraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank\nit in the pond, intending to return for it when the\ncoast was clear. Excellent, Mr. Holmes\u2014that is bet-\nter than your idea of a blind.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so; you have got an admirable theory. I\nhave no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild,\nbut you must admit that they have ended in dis-\ncovering the silver.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, yes. It was all your doing. But I have\nhad a bad set-back.\u201d\n\u201cA set-back?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Mr. Holmes. The Randall gang were ar-\nrested in New York this morning.\u201d\n\u201cDear me, Hopkins! That is certainly rather\nagainst your theory that they committed a murder\nin Kent last night.\u201d\n\u201cIt is fatal, Mr. Holmes, absolutely fatal. Still,\nthere are other gangs of three besides the Randalls,\nor it may be some new gang of which the police\nhave never heard.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so; it is perfectly possible. What, are\nyou off?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Mr. Holmes; there is no rest for me until\nI have got to the bottom of the business."

Every day\nof that voyage I loved her more, and many a time\nsince have I kneeled down in the darkness of the\nnight watch and kissed the deck of that ship be-\ncause I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was\nnever engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as\never a woman treated a man. I have no complaint\nto make. It was all love on my side, and all good\ncomradeship and friendship on hers. When we\nparted she was a free woman, but I could never\nagain be a free man. \u201cNext time I came back from sea I heard of her\nmarriage. Well, why shouldn\u2019t she marry whom\nshe liked? Title and money\u2014who could carry\nthem better than she? She was born for all that\nis beautiful and dainty. I didn\u2019t grieve over her\nmarriage. I was not such a sel\ufb01sh hound as that. I\njust rejoiced that good luck had come her way, and\nthat she had not thrown herself away on a penni-\nless sailor. That\u2019s how I loved Mary Fraser. 565\nThe Adventure of the Abbey Grange\n\u201cWell, I never thought to see her again; but\nlast voyage I was promoted, and the new boat was\nnot yet launched, so I had to wait for a couple of\nmonths with my people at Sydenham.

Theresa was always my friend, for\nshe loved Mary and hated this villain almost as\nmuch as I did. From her I learned the ways of the\nhouse. Mary used to sit up reading in her own lit-\ntle room downstairs. I crept round there last night\nand scratched at the window. At \ufb01rst she would\nnot open to me, but in her heart I know that now\nshe loves me, and she could not leave me in the\nfrosty night. She whispered to me to come round\nto the big front window, and I found it open before\nme so as to let me into the dining-room. Again\nI heard from her own lips things that made my\nblood boil, and again I cursed this brute who mis-\nhandled the woman that I loved. Well, gentlemen,\nI was standing with her just inside the window,\nin all innocence, as Heaven is my judge, when he\nrushed like a madman into the room, called her\nthe vilest name that a man could use to a woman,\nand welted her across the face with the stick he\nhad in his hand.

It was his life or mine, but far more than that it\nwas his life or hers, for how could I leave her in\nthe power of this madman? That was how I killed\nhim. Was I wrong? Well, then, what would either\nof you gentlemen have done if you had been in my\nposition? \u201cShe had screamed when he struck her, and\nthat brought old Theresa down from the room\nabove.

The\nreal reason lay in the reluctance which Mr. Holmes\nhas shown to the continued publication of his ex-\nperiences. So long as he was in actual professional\npractice the records of his successes were of some\npractical value to him; but since he has de\ufb01nitely\nretired from London and betaken himself to study\nand bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety\nhas become hateful to him, and he has perempto-\nrily requested that his wishes in this matter should\nbe strictly observed. It was only upon my rep-\nresenting to him that I had given a promise that\n\u201cThe Adventure of the Second Stain\u201d should be\npublished when the times were ripe, and pointing\nout to him that it is only appropriate that this long\nseries of episodes should culminate in the most im-\nportant international case which he has ever been\ncalled upon to handle, that I at last succeeded in\nobtaining his consent that a carefully-guarded ac-\ncount of the incident should at last be laid before\nthe public.

It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade,\nthat shall be nameless, that upon one Tuesday\nmorning in autumn we found two visitors of Euro-\npean fame within the walls of our humble room in\nBaker Street. The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-\neyed, and dominant, was none other than the il-\nlustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain. The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet\nof middle age, and endowed with every beauty\nof body and of mind, was the Right Honourable\nTrelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs,\nand the most rising statesman in the country. They\nsat side by side upon our paper-littered settee, and\nit was easy to see from their worn and anxious\nfaces that it was business of the most pressing im-\nportance which had brought them."

No\ndoubt you are right, and it is unreasonable for us\nto expect you to act unless we give you our entire\ncon\ufb01dence.\u201d\n\u201cI agree with you, sir,\u201d said the younger states-\nman. \u201cThen I will tell you, relying entirely upon your\nhonour and that of your colleague, Dr. Watson. I\nmay appeal to your patriotism also, for I could not\nimagine a greater misfortune for the country than\nthat this affair should come out.\u201d\n\u201cYou may safely trust us.\u201d\n\u201cThe letter, then, is from a certain foreign po-\ntentate who has been ruf\ufb02ed by some recent Colo-\nnial developments of this country. It has been\nwritten hurriedly and upon his own responsibility\nentirely. Inquiries have shown that his Ministers\nknow nothing of the matter. At the same time it is\ncouched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain\nphrases in it are of so provocative a character, that\nits publication would undoubtedly lead to a most\ndangerous state of feeling in this country. There\nwould be such a ferment, sir, that I do not hesi-\ntate to say that within a week of the publication\nof that letter this country would be involved in a\ngreat war.\u201d\n572\nThe Adventure of the Second Stain\nHolmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and\nhanded it to the Premier. \u201cExactly. It was he. And it is this letter\u2014this\nletter which may well mean the expenditure of a\nthousand millions and the lives of a hundred thou-\nsand men\u2014which has become lost in this unac-\ncountable fashion.\u201d\n\u201cHave you informed the sender?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\nsir,\na\ncipher\ntelegram\nhas\nbeen\ndespatched.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he desires the publication of the let-\nter.\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, we have strong reason to believe that\nhe already understands that he has acted in an in-\ndiscreet and hot-headed manner. It would be a\ngreater blow to him and to his country than to us\nif this letter were to come out.\u201d\n\u201cIf this is so, whose interest is it that the letter\nshould come out? Why should anyone desire to\nsteal it or to publish it?\u201d\n\u201cThere, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions\nof high international politics. But if you consider\nthe European situation you will have no dif\ufb01culty\nin perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is\nan armed camp. There is a double league which\nmakes a fair balance of military power. Great\nBritain holds the scales. If Britain were driven\ninto war with one confederacy, it would assure the\nsupremacy of the other confederacy, whether they\njoined in the war or not. Do you follow?\u201d\n\u201cVery clearly. It is then the interest of the en-\nemies of this potentate to secure and publish this\nletter, so as to make a breach between his country\nand ours?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to whom would this document be sent if\nit fell into the hands of an enemy?\u201d\n\u201cTo any of the great Chancelleries of Europe."

Now, Mr. Holmes, you are in full\npossession of the facts. What course do you rec-\nommend?\u201d\nHolmes shook his head mournfully. \u201cYou think, sir, that unless this document is re-\ncovered there will be war?\u201d\n\u201cI think it is very probable.\u201d\n\u201cThen, sir, prepare for war.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cConsider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that\nit was taken after eleven-thirty at night, since I un-\nderstand that Mr. Hope and his wife were both in\nthe room from that hour until the loss was found\nout. It was taken, then, yesterday evening between\nseven-thirty and eleven-thirty, probably near the\nearlier hour, since whoever took it evidently knew\nthat it was there and would naturally secure it as\nearly as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this\nimportance were taken at that hour, where can it\nbe now? No one has any reason to retain it. It\nhas been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What chance have we now to overtake or even to\ntrace it? It is beyond our reach.\u201d\nThe Prime Minister rose from the settee. \u201cWhat you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands.\u201d\n\u201cLet us presume, for argument\u2019s sake, that\nthe document was taken by the maid or by the\nvalet\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey are both old and tried servants.\u201d\n\u201cI understand you to say that your room is on\nthe second \ufb02oor, that there is no entrance from\nwithout, and that from within no one could go up\nunobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the\nhouse who has taken it. To whom would the thief\ntake it? To one of several international spies and\nsecret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar\nto me. There are three who may be said to be the\nheads of their profession. I will begin my research\nby going round and \ufb01nding if each of them is at\nhis post. If one is missing\u2014especially if he has\ndisappeared since last night\u2014we will have some\nindication as to where the document has gone.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should he be missing?\u201d asked the Euro-\npean Secretary. \u201cHe would take the letter to an\nEmbassy in London, as likely as not.\u201d\n\u201cI fancy not. These agents work independently,\nand their relations with the Embassies are often\nstrained.\u201d\nThe Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence. \u201cI believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would\ntake so valuable a prize to head-quarters with his\nown hands. I think that your course of action is\nan excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot ne-\nglect all our other duties on account of this one\nmisfortune."

When our illustrious visitors had departed\nHolmes lit his pipe in silence, and sat for some\ntime lost in the deepest thought. I had opened the\nmorning paper and was immersed in a sensational\ncrime which had occurred in London the night be-\nfore, when my friend gave an exclamation, sprang\nto his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the man-\ntelpiece. \u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cthere is no better way of ap-\nproaching it.

He stared in amazement, and then\nsnatched the paper from my hands. This was the\nparagraph which I had been engaged in reading\nwhen he rose from his chair:\nMurder in Westminster\nA crime of mysterious character was com-\nmitted last night at 16, Godolphin Street,\none of the old-fashioned and secluded rows\nof eighteenth-century houses which lie be-\ntween the river and the Abbey, almost in\nthe shadow of the great Tower of the Houses\nof Parliament. This small but select man-\nsion has been inhabited for some years by\nMr. Eduardo Lucas, well known in soci-\nety circles both on account of his charm-\ning personality and because he has the well-\ndeserved reputation of being one of the best\namateur tenors in the country. Mr. Lucas\nis an unmarried man, thirty-four years of\nage, and his establishment consists of Mrs.\nPringle, an elderly housekeeper, and of Mit-\nton, his valet. The former retires early and\nsleeps at the top of the house. The valet\nwas out for the evening, visiting a friend at\nHammersmith. From ten o\u2019clock onwards\nMr. Lucas had the house to himself.

He then pushed open\nthe door and entered. The room was in a\nstate of wild disorder, the furniture being\nall swept to one side, and one chair lying\non its back in the centre. Beside this chair,\nand still grasping one of its legs, lay the un-\nfortunate tenant of the house. He had been\nstabbed to the heart and must have died in-\nstantly. The knife with which the crime had\nbeen committed was a curved Indian dag-\nger, plucked down from a trophy of Orien-\ntal arms which adorned one of the walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the\nmotive of the crime, for there had been no\nattempt to remove the valuable contents of\nthe room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well\nknown and popular that his violent and\nmysterious fate will arouse painful inter-\nest and intense sympathy in a wide-spread\ncircle of friends. \u201cWell, Watson, what do you make of this?\u201d asked\nHolmes, after a long pause. \u201cIt is an amazing coincidence.\u201d\n\u201cA coincidence! Here is one of the three men\nwhom we had named as possible actors in this\ndrama, and he meets a violent death during the\nvery hours when we know that that drama was\nbeing enacted.

They know\u2014and shall\nknow\u2014nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only we\nknow of both events, and can trace the relation\nbetween them. There is one obvious point which\n574\nThe Adventure of the Second Stain\nwould, in any case, have turned my suspicions\nagainst Lucas. Godolphin Street, Westminster, is\nonly a few minutes\u2019 walk from Whitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have named live\nin the extreme West-end. It was easier, therefore,\nfor Lucas than for the others to establish a connec-\ntion or receive a message from the European Sec-\nretary\u2019s household\u2014a small thing, and yet where\nevents are compressed into a few hours it may\nprove essential. Halloa! what have we here?\u201d\nMrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady\u2019s card\nupon her salver. Holmes glanced at it, raised his\neyebrows, and handed it over to me. \u201cAsk Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be\nkind enough to step up,\u201d said he. A moment later our modest apartment, already\nso distinguished that morning, was further hon-\noured by the entrance of the most lovely woman\nin London. I had often heard of the beauty of\nthe youngest daughter of the Duke of Belmin-\nster, but no description of it, and no contempla-\ntion of colourless photographs, had prepared me\nfor the subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful\ncolouring of that exquisite head."

He would say nothing of the case, and it\nwas from the papers that I learned the particulars\nof the inquest, and the arrest with the subsequent\nrelease of John Mitton, the valet of the deceased. The coroner\u2019s jury brought in the obvious \u201cWilful\nMurder,\u201d but the parties remained as unknown as\never. No motive was suggested. The room was\nfull of articles of value, but none had been taken. The dead man\u2019s papers had not been tampered\nwith. They were carefully examined, and showed\nthat he was a keen student of international poli-\ntics, an indefatigable gossip, a remarkable linguist,\nand an untiring letter-writer. He had been on inti-\nmate terms with the leading politicians of several\ncountries. But nothing sensational was discovered\namong the documents which \ufb01lled his drawers. As\nto his relations with women, they appeared to have\nbeen promiscuous but super\ufb01cial. He had many\nacquaintances among them, but few friends, and\nno one whom he loved. His habits were regular,\nhis conduct inoffensive. His death was an abso-\nlute mystery, and likely to remain so. As to the arrest of John Mitton, the valet, it\nwas a counsel of despair as an alternative to ab-\nsolute inaction. But no case could be sustained\nagainst him. He had visited friends in Hammer-\nsmith that night. The alibi was complete. It is true\nthat he started home at an hour which should have\nbrought him to Westminster before the time when\nthe crime was discovered, but his own explana-\ntion that he had walked part of the way seemed\nprobable enough in view of the \ufb01neness of the\nnight. He had actually arrived at twelve o\u2019clock,\nand appeared to be overwhelmed by the unex-\npected tragedy. He had always been on good\nterms with his master. Several of the dead man\u2019s\npossessions\u2014notably a small case of razors\u2014had\nbeen found in the valet\u2019s boxes, but he explained\nthat they had been presents from the deceased,\nand the housekeeper was able to corroborate the\nstory. Mitton had been in Lucas\u2019s employment for\nthree years. It was noticeable that Lucas did not\ntake Mitton on the Continent with him. Some-\ntimes he visited Paris for three months on end, but\nMitton was left in charge of the Godolphin Street\nhouse. As to the housekeeper, she had heard noth-\ning on the night of the crime. If her master had a\nvisitor he had himself admitted him. So for three mornings the mystery remained,\nso far as I could follow it in the papers. If Holmes\nknew more he kept his own counsel, but, as he\ntold me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into\nhis con\ufb01dence in the case, I knew that he was in\nclose touch with every development. Upon the\nfourth day there appeared a long telegram from\nParis which seemed to solve the whole question. A discovery has just been made by the\nParisian police [said the Daily Telegraph]\nwhich raises the veil which hung round the\ntragic fate of Mr. Eduardo Lucas, who met\nhis death by violence last Monday night at\n576\nThe Adventure of the Second Stain\nGodolphin Street, Westminster."

Yesterday a lady, who has been known as\nMme. Henri Fournaye, occupying a small\nvilla in the Rue Austerlitz, was reported\nto the authorities by her servants as being\ninsane. An examination showed that she\nhad indeed developed mania of a dangerous\nand permanent form. On inquiry the police\nhave discovered that Mme. Henri Fournaye\nonly returned from a journey to London on\nTuesday last, and there is evidence to con-\nnect her with the crime at Westminster. A\ncomparison of photographs has proved con-\nclusively that M. Henri Fournaye and Ed-\nuardo Lucas were really one and the same\nperson, and that the deceased had for some\nreason lived a double life in London and\nParis. Mme. Fournaye, who is of Creole\norigin, is of an extremely excitable nature,\nand has suffered in the past from attacks of\njealousy which have amounted to frenzy. It\nis conjectured that it was in one of these\nthat she committed the terrible crime which\nhas caused such a sensation in London. Her\nmovements upon the Monday night have\nnot yet been traced, but it is undoubted\nthat a woman answering to her description\nattracted much attention at Charing Cross\nStation on Tuesday morning by the wild-\nness of her appearance and the violence of\nher gestures. It is probable, therefore, that\nthe crime was either committed when in-\nsane, or that its immediate effect was to\ndrive the unhappy woman out of her mind. At present she is unable to give any co-\nherent account of the past, and the doctors\nhold out no hopes of the re-establishment\nof her reason. There is evidence that a\nwoman, who might have been Mme. Four-\nnaye, was seen for some hours on Mon-\nday night watching the house in Godolphin\nStreet. \u201cWhat do you think of that, Holmes?\u201d I had read\nthe account aloud to him, while he \ufb01nished his\nbreakfast. \u201cMy dear Watson,\u201d said he, as he rose from the\ntable and paced up and down the room, \u201cyou are\nmost long-suffering, but if I have told you nothing\nin the last three days it is because there is nothing\nto tell.

In\nthe window was a sumptuous writing-desk, and\nevery detail of the apartment, the pictures, the\nrugs, and the hangings, all pointed to a taste which\nwas luxurious to the verge of effeminacy. \u201cSeen the Paris news?\u201d asked Lestrade. Holmes nodded. \u201cOur French friends seem to have touched the\nspot this time. No doubt it\u2019s just as they say. She\n577\nThe Adventure of the Second Stain\nknocked at the door\u2014surprise visit, I guess, for he\nkept his life in water-tight compartments. He let\nher in\u2014couldn\u2019t keep her in the street. She told\nhim how she had traced him, reproached him, one\nthing led to another, and then with that dagger so\nhandy the end soon came. It wasn\u2019t all done in\nan instant, though, for these chairs were all swept\nover yonder, and he had one in his hand as if he\nhad tried to hold her off with it. We\u2019ve got it all\nclear as if we had seen it.\u201d\nHolmes raised his eyebrows. \u201cAnd yet you have sent for me?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, that\u2019s another matter\u2014a mere tri\ufb02e,\nbut the sort of thing you take an interest in\u2014queer,\nyou know, and what you might call freakish."

Nothing has been moved. Of\ufb01cer in charge here\nday and night. This morning, as the man was\nburied and the investigation over\u2014so far as this\nroom is concerned\u2014we thought we could tidy up\na bit. This carpet. You see, it is not fastened down;\nonly just laid there. We had occasion to raise it. We found\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes? You found\u2014\u201d\nHolmes\u2019s face grew tense with anxiety. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you would never guess in a\nhundred years what we did \ufb01nd. You see that stain\non the carpet? Well, a great deal must have soaked\nthrough, must it not?\u201d\n\u201cUndoubtedly it must.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you will be surprised to hear that there\nis no stain on the white woodwork to correspond.\u201d\n\u201cNo stain! But there must\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes; so you would say. But the fact remains\nthat there isn\u2019t.\u201d\nHe took the corner of the carpet in his hand\nand, turning it over, he showed that it was indeed\nas he said. \u201cBut the underside is as stained as the upper. It must have left a mark.\u201d\nLestrade chuckled with delight at having puz-\nzled the famous expert. \u201cNow I\u2019ll show you the explanation. There is a\nsecond stain, but it does not correspond with the\nother. See for yourself.\u201d As he spoke he turned\nover another portion of the carpet, and there, sure\nenough, was a great crimson spill upon the square\nwhite facing of the old-fashioned \ufb02oor. \u201cWhat do\nyou make of that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, it is simple enough. The two stains\ndid correspond, but the carpet has been turned\nround. As it was square and unfastened it was\neasily done.\u201d\n\u201cThe\nof\ufb01cial\npolice\ndon\u2019t\nneed\nyou,\nMr.\nHolmes, to tell them that the carpet must have\nbeen turned round. That\u2019s clear enough, for the\nstains lie above each other\u2014if you lay it over this\nway. But what I want to know is, who shifted the\ncarpet, and why?\u201d\nI could see from Holmes\u2019s rigid face that he\nwas vibrating with inward excitement. \u201cLook here, Lestrade,\u201d said he, \u201chas that con-\nstable in the passage been in charge of the place all\nthe time?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he has.\u201d\n\u201cWell, take my advice. Examine him carefully. Don\u2019t do it before us. We\u2019ll wait here. You take\nhim into the back room. You\u2019ll be more likely to\nget a confession out of him alone. Ask him how\nhe dared to admit people and leave them alone in\nthis room. Don\u2019t ask him if he has done it. Take it\nfor granted. Tell him you know someone has been\nhere. Press him. Tell him that a full confession is\nhis only chance of forgiveness. Do exactly what I\ntell you!\u201d\n\u201cBy George, if he knows I\u2019ll have it out of him!\u201d\ncried Lestrade. He darted into the hall, and a few\nmoments later his bullying voice sounded from the\nback room."

He tore the drugget from\nthe \ufb02oor, and in an instant was down on his hands\nand knees clawing at each of the squares of wood\nbeneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his\nnails into the edge of it. It hinged back like the lid\nof a box. A small black cavity opened beneath it. Holmes plunged his eager hand into it, and drew\nit out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappoint-\nment. It was empty. \u201cQuick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!\u201d\nThe wooden lid was replaced, and the drugget\nhad only just been drawn straight when Lestrade\u2019s\nvoice was heard in the passage. He found Holmes\nleaning languidly against the mantelpiece, re-\nsigned and patient, endeavouring to conceal his\nirrepressible yawns. \u201cSorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Holmes. I can\nsee that you are bored to death with the whole af-\nfair. Well, he has confessed, all right. Come in\n578\nThe Adventure of the Second Stain\nhere, MacPherson. Let these gentlemen hear of\nyour most inexcusable conduct.\u201d\nThe big constable, very hot and penitent, sidled\ninto the room. \u201cI meant no harm, sir, I\u2019m sure. The young\nwoman came to the door last evening\u2014mistook\nthe house, she did. And then we got talking. It\u2019s\nlonesome, when you\u2019re on duty here all day.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what happened then?\u201d\n\u201cShe wanted to see where the crime was\ndone\u2014had read about it in the papers, she said. She was a very respectable, well-spoken young\nwoman, sir, and I saw no harm in letting her have\na peep. When she saw that mark on the carpet,\ndown she dropped on the \ufb02oor, and lay as if she\nwere dead. I ran to the back and got some water,\nbut I could not bring her to. Then I went round the\ncorner to the Ivy Plant for some brandy, and by the\ntime I had brought it back the young woman had\nrecovered and was off\u2014ashamed of herself, I dare\nsay, and dared not face me.\u201d\n\u201cHow about moving that drugget?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly, when\nI came back. You see, she fell on it, and it lies on\na polished \ufb02oor with nothing to keep it in place. I\nstraightened it out afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson to you that you can\u2019t deceive me,\nConstable MacPherson,\u201d said Lestrade, with dig-\nnity. \u201cNo doubt you thought that your breach of\nduty could never be discovered, and yet a mere\nglance at that drugget was enough to convince me\nthat someone had been admitted to the room. It\u2019s\nlucky for you, my man, that nothing is missing,\nor you would \ufb01nd yourself in Queer Street. I\u2019m\nsorry to have called you down over such a petty\nbusiness, Mr. Holmes, but I thought the point of\nthe second stain not corresponding with the \ufb01rst\nwould interest you.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, it was most interesting."

There are some points\nwhich are as dark as ever. But we have so much\nthat it will be our own fault if we cannot get the\nrest. We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and\nbring the matter to a head.\u201d\nWhen we arrived at the residence of the Euro-\npean Secretary it was for Lady Hilda Trelawney\nHope that Sherlock Holmes inquired. We were\nshown into the morning-room. \u201cMr. Holmes!\u201d said the lady, and her face was\npink with her indignation, \u201cthis is surely most un-\nfair and ungenerous upon your part.

And yet you compromise me by\ncoming here and so showing that there are busi-\nness relations between us.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, madam, I had no possible al-\nternative.

I be-\nlieve you have eyes in the back of your head.\u201d\n\u201cI have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated\ncoffee-pot in front of me,\u201d said he. \u201cBut, tell me,\nWatson, what do you make of our visitor\u2019s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him\nand have no notion of his errand, this accidental\nsouvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you\nreconstruct the man by an examination of it.\u201d\n\u201cI think,\u201d said I, following as far as I could the\nmethods of my companion, \u201cthat Dr. Mortimer is\na successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed\nsince those who know him give him this mark of\ntheir appreciation.\u201d\n\u201cGood!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cExcellent!\u201d\n\u201cI think also that the probability is in favour of\nhis being a country practitioner who does a great\ndeal of his visiting on foot.\u201d\n\u201cWhy so?\u201d\n\u201cBecause this stick, though originally a very\nhandsome one has been so knocked about that I\ncan hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evi-\ndent that he has done a great amount of walking\nwith it.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly sound!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAnd then again, there is the \u2018friends of the\nC.C.H.\u2019 I should guess that to be the Something\nHunt, the local hunt to whose members he has\npossibly given some surgical assistance, and which\nhas made him a small presentation in return.\u201d\n\u201cReally,\nWatson,\nyou excel yourself,\u201d said\nHolmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a\ncigarette. \u201cI am bound to say that in all the ac-\ncounts which you have been so good as to give\nof my own small achievements you have habitu-\nally underrated your own abilities. It may be that\nyou are not yourself luminous, but you are a con-\nductor of light. Some people without possessing\ngenius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in\nyour debt.\u201d\nHe had never said as much before, and I must\nadmit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for\nI had often been piqued by his indifference to my\nadmiration and to the attempts which I had made\nto give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too,\nto think that I had so far mastered his system as to\napply it in a way which earned his approval. He\nnow took the stick from my hands and examined it\nfor a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with\nan expression of interest he laid down his cigarette,\nand carrying the cane to the window, he looked\nover it again with a convex lens."

It gives us the basis for several deduc-\ntions.\u201d\n\u201cHas anything escaped me?\u201d I asked with some\nself-importance. \u201cI trust that there is nothing of\nconsequence which I have overlooked?\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of\nyour conclusions were erroneous. When I said that\nyou stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in\nnoting your fallacies I was occasionally guided to-\nwards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong\nin this instance. The man is certainly a country\npractitioner. And he walks a good deal.\u201d\n\u201cThen I was right.\u201d\n\u201cTo that extent.\u201d\n\u201cBut that was all.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, my dear Watson, not all\u2014by no\nmeans all. I would suggest, for example, that a\npresentation to a doctor is more likely to come\nfrom a hospital than from a hunt, and that when\nthe initials \u2018C.C.\u2019 are placed before that hospital\nthe words \u2018Charing Cross\u2019 very naturally suggest\nthemselves.\u201d\n\u201cYou may be right.\u201d\n\u201cThe probability lies in that direction. And if\nwe take this as a working hypothesis we have a\n587\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nfresh basis from which to start our construction of\nthis unknown visitor.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, supposing that \u2018C.C.H.\u2019 does stand\nfor \u2018Charing Cross Hospital,\u2019 what further infer-\nences may we draw?\u201d\n\u201cDo none suggest themselves? You know my\nmethods. Apply them!\u201d\n\u201cI can only think of the obvious conclusion that\nthe man has practised in town before going to the\ncountry.\u201d\n\u201cI think that we might venture a little farther\nthan this. Look at it in this light. On what occasion\nwould it be most probable that such a presentation\nwould be made? When would his friends unite to\ngive him a pledge of their good will? Obviously\nat the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from\nthe service of the hospital in order to start in prac-\ntice for himself. We know there has been a presen-\ntation. We believe there has been a change from\na town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,\nstretching our inference too far to say that the pre-\nsentation was on the occasion of the change?\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly seems probable.\u201d\n\u201cNow, you will observe that he could not have\nbeen on the staff of the hospital, since only a\nman well-established in a London practice could\nhold such a position, and such a one would not\ndrift into the country. What was he, then? If he\nwas in the hospital and yet not on the staff he\ncould only have been a house-surgeon or a house-\nphysician\u2014little more than a senior student. And\nhe left \ufb01ve years ago\u2014the date is on the stick. So\nyour grave, middle-aged family practitioner van-\nishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there\nemerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, un-\nambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a\nfavourite dog, which I should describe roughly as\nbeing larger than a terrier and smaller than a mas-\ntiff.\u201d\nI laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes\nleaned back in his settee and blew little wavering\nrings of smoke up to the ceiling."

I think that\nI am fairly justi\ufb01ed in my inferences. As to the\nadjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, un-\nambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience\nthat it is only an amiable man in this world who re-\nceives testimonials, only an unambitious one who\nabandons a London career for the country, and\nonly an absent-minded one who leaves his stick\nand not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in\nyour room.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the dog?\u201d\n\u201cHas been in the habit of carrying this stick be-\nhind his master. Being a heavy stick the dog has\nheld it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his\nteeth are very plainly visible. The dog\u2019s jaw, as\nshown in the space between these marks, is too\nbroad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad\nenough for a mastiff. It may have been\u2014yes, by\nJove, it is a curly-haired spaniel.\u201d\nHe had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess of the window. There\nwas such a ring of conviction in his voice that I\nglanced up in surprise. \u201cMy dear fellow, how can you possibly be so\nsure of that?\u201d\n\u201cFor the very simple reason that I see the dog\nhimself on our very door-step, and there is the ring\nof its owner. Don\u2019t move, I beg you, Watson. He\nis a professional brother of yours, and your pres-\nence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dra-\nmatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a\nstep upon the stair which is walking into your life,\nand you know not whether for good or ill. What\ndoes Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask\nof Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come\nin!\u201d\nThe appearance of our visitor was a surprise\nto me, since I had expected a typical country\n588\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\npractitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with\na long nose like a beak, which jutted out be-\ntween two keen, gray eyes, set closely together\nand sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-\nrimmed glasses."

A cast of your skull,\nsir, until the original is available, would be an or-\nnament to any anthropological museum.

Have no hesitation in lighting\none.\u201d\nThe man drew out paper and tobacco and\ntwirled the one up in the other with surprising\ndexterity. He had long, quivering \ufb01ngers as agile\nand restless as the antennae of an insect. Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances\nshowed me the interest which he took in our curi-\nous companion. \u201cI presume, sir,\u201d said he at last, \u201cthat it was\nnot merely for the purpose of examining my skull\nthat you have done me the honour to call here last\nnight and again to-day?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, no; though I am happy to have had\nthe opportunity of doing that as well.

I\nmay say that I was his personal friend as well as\nhis medical attendant. He was a strong-minded\nman, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative\nas I am myself. Yet he took this document very\nseriously, and his mind was prepared for just such\nan end as did eventually overtake him.\u201d\nHolmes\nstretched\nout\nhis\nhand\nfor\nthe\nmanuscript and \ufb02attened it upon his knee. \u201cYou will observe, Watson, the alternative use\nof the long s and the short. It is one of several\nindications which enabled me to \ufb01x the date.\u201d\nI looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper\nand the faded script. At the head was written:\n\u201cBaskerville Hall,\u201d and below in large, scrawling\n\ufb01gures: \u201c1742.\u201d\n\u201cIt appears to be a statement of some sort.\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is a statement of a certain legend which\nruns in the Baskerville family.\u201d\n\u201cBut I understand that it is something more\nmodern and practical upon which you wish to\nconsult me?\u201d\n\u201cMost modern. A most practical, pressing mat-\nter, which must be decided within twenty-four\nhours. But the manuscript is short and is inti-\nmately connected with the affair. With your per-\nmission I will read it to you.\u201d\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, placed his\n\ufb01nger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with\nan air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the\nmanuscript to the light and read in a high, crack-\ning voice the following curious, old-world narra-\ntive:\u2014\n\u201cOf the origin of the Hound of the\nBaskervilles there have been many state-\nments, yet as I come in a direct line from\nHugo Baskerville, and as I had the story\nfrom my father, who also had it from his,\nI have set it down with all belief that it\noccurred even as is here set forth."

Learn then from\nthis story not to fear the fruits of the past,\nbut rather to be circumspect in the future,\nthat those foul passions whereby our family\nhas suffered so grievously may not again be\nloosed to our undoing. \u201cKnow then that in the time of the Great\nRebellion (the history of which by the\nlearned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly\ncommend to your attention) this Manor of\nBaskerville was held by Hugo of that name,\nnor can it be gainsaid that he was a most\nwild, profane, and godless man. This, in\ntruth, his neighbours might have pardoned,\nseeing that saints have never \ufb02ourished in\nthose parts, but there was in him a cer-\ntain wanton and cruel humour which made\nhis name a byword through the West. It\nchanced that this Hugo came to love (if, in-\ndeed, so dark a passion may be known un-\nder so bright a name) the daughter of a yeo-\nman who held lands near the Baskerville es-\ntate. But the young maiden, being discreet\nand of good repute, would ever avoid him,\nfor she feared his evil name. So it came to\npass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with\n\ufb01ve or six of his idle and wicked compan-\nions, stole down upon the farm and carried\noff the maiden, her father and brothers be-\ning from home, as he well knew. When they\nhad brought her to the Hall the maiden was\nplaced in an upper chamber, while Hugo\nand his friends sat down to a long carouse,\nas was their nightly custom. Now, the\npoor lass upstairs was like to have her wits\nturned at the singing and shouting and ter-\nrible oaths which came up to her from be-\n590\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nlow, for they say that the words used by\nHugo Baskerville, when he was in wine,\nwere such as might blast the man who said\nthem. At last in the stress of her fear she did\nthat which might have daunted the bravest\nor most active man, for by the aid of the\ngrowth of ivy which covered (and still cov-\ners) the south wall she came down from un-\nder the eaves, and so homeward across the\nmoor, there being three leagues betwixt the\nHall and her father\u2019s farm. \u201cIt chanced that some little time later\nHugo left his guests to carry food and\ndrink\u2014with\nother\nworse\nthings,\nper-\nchance\u2014to his captive, and so found the\ncage empty and the bird escaped. Then,\nas it would seem, he became as one that\nhath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs\ninto the dining-hall, he sprang upon the\ngreat table, \ufb02agons and trenchers \ufb02ying be-\nfore him, and he cried aloud before all the\ncompany that he would that very night ren-\nder his body and soul to the Powers of Evil\nif he might but overtake the wench."

But at length some sense came back to their\ncrazed minds, and the whole of them, thir-\nteen in number, took horse and started in\npursuit. The moon shone clear above them,\nand they rode swiftly abreast, taking that\ncourse which the maid must needs have\ntaken if she were to reach her own home. \u201cThey had gone a mile or two when they\npassed one of the night shepherds upon the\nmoorlands, and they cried to him to know\nif he had seen the hunt.

These, though known for their val-\nour and their breed, were whimpering in a\ncluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,\nas we call it, upon the moor, some slinking\naway and some, with starting hackles and\nstaring eyes, gazing down the narrow val-\nley before them. \u201cThe company had come to a halt, more\nsober men, as you may guess, than when\nthey started. The most of them would by no\nmeans advance, but three of them, the bold-\nest, or it may be the most drunken, rode for-\nward down the goyal. Now, it opened into\na broad space in which stood two of those\ngreat stones, still to be seen there, which\nwere set by certain forgotten peoples in the\ndays of old."

But it was not\nthe sight of her body, nor yet was it that\nof the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near\nher, which raised the hair upon the heads\nof these three daredevil roysterers, but it\nwas that, standing over Hugo, and pluck-\ning at his throat, there stood a foul thing,\na great, black beast, shaped like a hound,\nyet larger than any hound that ever mor-\ntal eye has rested upon. And even as they\nlooked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo\nBaskerville, on which, as it turned its blaz-\ning eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the\nthree shrieked with fear and rode for dear\nlife, still screaming, across the moor.

This is the Devon County\nChronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short ac-\ncount of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles\nBaskerville which occurred a few days before that\ndate.\u201d\nMy friend leaned a little forward and his ex-\npression became intent. Our visitor readjusted his\nglasses and began:\u2014\n\u201cThe recent sudden death of Sir Charles\nBaskerville, whose name has been men-\ntioned as the probable Liberal candidate for\nMid-Devon at the next election, has cast a\ngloom over the county."

In\nthese days of nouveaux riches it is refresh-\ning to \ufb01nd a case where the scion of an old\ncounty family which has fallen upon evil\ndays is able to make his own fortune and to\nbring it back with him to restore the fallen\ngrandeur of his line. Sir Charles, as is well\nknown, made large sums of money in South\nAfrican speculation. More wise than those\nwho go on until the wheel turns against\nthem, he realized his gains and returned to\nEngland with them. It is only two years\nsince he took up his residence at Baskerville\nHall, and it is common talk how large were\nthose schemes of reconstruction and im-\nprovement which have been interrupted by\nhis death. Being himself childless, it was\nhis openly expressed desire that the whole\ncountry-side should, within his own life-\ntime, pro\ufb01t by his good fortune, and many\nwill have personal reasons for bewailing his\nuntimely end. His generous donations to\nlocal and county charities have been fre-\nquently chronicled in these columns. \u201cThe circumstances connected with the\ndeath of Sir Charles cannot be said to have\nbeen entirely cleared up by the inquest, but\nat least enough has been done to dispose\nof those rumours to which local supersti-\ntion has given rise. There is no reason\nwhatever to suspect foul play, or to imag-\nine that death could be from any but nat-\nural causes. Sir Charles was a widower,\nand a man who may be said to have been in\nsome ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In\nspite of his considerable wealth he was sim-\nple in his personal tastes, and his indoor\nservants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a\nmarried couple named Barrymore, the hus-\nband acting as butler and the wife as house-\nkeeper. Their evidence, corroborated by that\nof several friends, tends to show that Sir\nCharles\u2019s health has for some time been im-\npaired, and points especially to some af-\nfection of the heart, manifesting itself in\nchanges of colour, breathlessness, and acute\nattacks of nervous depression. Dr. James\nMortimer, the friend and medical attendant\nof the deceased, has given evidence to the\nsame effect. \u201cThe facts of the case are simple. Sir\nCharles Baskerville was in the habit every\nnight before going to bed of walking down\nthe famous Yew Alley of Baskerville Hall. The evidence of the Barrymores shows that\nthis had been his custom. On the 4th of\n592\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nMay Sir Charles had declared his inten-\ntion of starting next day for London, and\nhad ordered Barrymore to prepare his lug-\ngage. That night he went out as usual for\nhis nocturnal walk, in the course of which\nhe was in the habit of smoking a cigar."

The day had\nbeen wet, and Sir Charles\u2019s footmarks were\neasily traced down the Alley. Half-way\ndown this walk there is a gate which leads\nout on to the moor. There were indications\nthat Sir Charles had stood for some little\ntime here. He then proceeded down the Al-\nley, and it was at the far end of it that his\nbody was discovered. One fact which has\nnot been explained is the statement of Bar-\nrymore that his master\u2019s footprints altered\ntheir character from the time that he passed\nthe moor-gate, and that he appeared from\nthence onward to have been walking upon\nhis toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer,\nwas on the moor at no great distance at the\ntime, but he appears by his own confession\nto have been the worse for drink. He de-\nclares that he heard cries, but is unable to\nstate from what direction they came. No\nsigns of violence were to be discovered upon\nSir Charles\u2019s person, and though the doc-\ntor\u2019s evidence pointed to an almost incredi-\nble facial distortion\u2014so great that Dr. Mor-\ntimer refused at \ufb01rst to believe that it was\nindeed his friend and patient who lay before\nhim\u2014it was explained that that is a symp-\ntom which is not unusual in cases of dys-\npnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by the post-\nmortem examination, which showed long-\nstanding organic disease, and the coroner\u2019s\njury returned a verdict in accordance with\nthe medical evidence. It is well that this is\nso, for it is obviously of the utmost impor-\ntance that Sir Charles\u2019s heir should settle at\nthe Hall and continue the good work which\nhas been so sadly interrupted. Had the pro-\nsaic \ufb01nding of the coroner not \ufb01nally put an\nend to the romantic stories which have been\nwhispered in connection with the affair, it\nmight have been dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd a tenant\nfor Baskerville Hall. It is understood that\nthe next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,\nif he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles\nBaskerville\u2019s younger brother. The young\nman when last heard of was in America,\nand inquiries are being instituted with a\nview to informing him of his good fortune.\u201d\nDr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced\nit in his pocket. \u201cThose are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in con-\nnection with the death of Sir Charles Baskerville.\u201d\n\u201cI must thank you,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes,\n\u201cfor calling my attention to a case which certainly\npresents some features of interest. I had observed\nsome newspaper comment at the time, but I was\nexceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the\nVatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the\nPope I lost touch with several interesting English\ncases. This article, you say, contains all the public\nfacts?\u201d\n\u201cIt does.\u201d\n\u201cThen let me have the private ones.\u201d He leaned\nback, put his \ufb01nger-tips together, and assumed his\nmost impassive and judicial expression."

My motive for withholding it from the coroner\u2019s\ninquiry is that a man of science shrinks from plac-\ning himself in the public position of seeming to in-\ndorse a popular superstition. I had the further mo-\ntive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would\ncertainly remain untenanted if anything were done\nto increase its already rather grim reputation. For\nboth these reasons I thought that I was justi\ufb01ed in\ntelling rather less than I knew, since no practical\ngood could result from it, but with you there is no\nreason why I should not be perfectly frank. \u201cThe moor is very sparsely inhabited, and\nthose who live near each other are thrown very\nmuch together. For this reason I saw a good deal\nof Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of\nMr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton,\nthe naturalist, there are no other men of education\nwithin many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man,\nbut the chance of his illness brought us together,\nand a community of interests in science kept us so. He had brought back much scienti\ufb01c information\nfrom South Africa, and many a charming evening\nwe have spent together discussing the comparative\nanatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot. \u201cWithin the last few months it became increas-\ningly plain to me that Sir Charles\u2019s nervous system\nwas strained to the breaking point. He had taken\nthis legend which I have read you exceedingly to\nheart\u2014so much so that, although he would walk\nin his own grounds, nothing would induce him to\n593\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\ngo out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it\nmay appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly\nconvinced that a dreadful fate overhung his fam-\nily, and certainly the records which he was able to\ngive of his ancestors were not encouraging. The\nidea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted\nhim, and on more than one occasion he has asked\nme whether I had on my medical journeys at night\never seen any strange creature or heard the baying\nof a hound. The latter question he put to me sev-\neral times, and always with a voice which vibrated\nwith excitement. \u201cI can well remember driving up to his house\nin the evening some three weeks before the fatal\nevent. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had\ndescended from my gig and was standing in front\nof him, when I saw his eyes \ufb01x themselves over\nmy shoulder, and stare past me with an expres-\nsion of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round\nand had just time to catch a glimpse of something\nwhich I took to be a large black calf passing at the\nhead of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he\nthat I was compelled to go down to the spot where\nthe animal had been and look around for it."

I stayed with\nhim all the evening, and it was on that occasion,\nto explain the emotion which he had shown, that\nhe con\ufb01ded to my keeping that narrative which\nI read to you when \ufb01rst I came. I mention this\nsmall episode because it assumes some importance\nin view of the tragedy which followed, but I was\nconvinced at the time that the matter was entirely\ntrivial and that his excitement had no justi\ufb01cation. \u201cIt was at my advice that Sir Charles was about\nto go to London. His heart was, I knew, affected,\nand the constant anxiety in which he lived, how-\never chimerical the cause of it might be, was ev-\nidently having a serious effect upon his health. I\nthought that a few months among the distractions\nof town would send him back a new man. Mr. Sta-\npleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned\nat his state of health, was of the same opinion. At\nthe last instant came this terrible catastrophe. \u201cOn the night of Sir Charles\u2019s death Barrymore\nthe butler, who made the discovery, sent Perkins\nthe groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting\nup late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within\nan hour of the event. I checked and corroborated\nall the facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the Yew Alley, I saw\nthe spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have\nwaited, I remarked the change in the shape of the\nprints after that point, I noted that there were no\nother footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft\ngravel, and \ufb01nally I carefully examined the body,\nwhich had not been touched until my arrival. Sir\nCharles lay on his face, his arms out, his \ufb01ngers\ndug into the ground, and his features convulsed\nwith some strong emotion to such an extent that I\ncould hardly have sworn to his identity. There was\ncertainly no physical injury of any kind. But one\nfalse statement was made by Barrymore at the in-\nquest. He said that there were no traces upon the\nground round the body. He did not observe any.

The Problem\nI confess at these words a shudder passed\nthrough me. There was a thrill in the doctor\u2019s\nvoice which showed that he was himself deeply\nmoved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned\nforward in his excitement and his eyes had the\nhard, dry glitter which shot from them when he\nwas keenly interested. \u201cYou saw this?\u201d\n\u201cAs clearly as I see you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you said nothing?\u201d\n594\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\u201cWhat was the use?\u201d\n\u201cHow was it that no one else saw it?\u201d\n\u201cThe marks were some twenty yards from the\nbody and no one gave them a thought."

The only other kinsman whom we\nhave been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville,\nthe youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir\nCharles was the elder. The second brother, who\ndied young, is the father of this lad Henry. The\nthird, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain,\nand was the very image, they tell me, of the family\npicture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to\nhold him, \ufb02ed to Central America, and died there\nin 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the\nBaskervilles.

Good morning.\u201d\nHolmes returned to his seat with that quiet\nlook of inward satisfaction which meant that he\nhad a congenial task before him. \u201cGoing out, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cUnless I can help you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action\nthat I turn to you for aid.

It would be as well if you could make it convenient\nnot to return before evening. Then I should be\nvery glad to compare impressions as to this most\ninteresting problem which has been submitted to\nus this morning.\u201d\nI knew that seclusion and solitude were very\nnecessary for my friend in those hours of intense\nmental concentration during which he weighed\nevery particle of evidence, constructed alternative\ntheories, balanced one against the other, and made\nup his mind as to which points were essential and\nwhich immaterial. I therefore spent the day at\nmy club and did not return to Baker Street until\nevening. It was nearly nine o\u2019clock when I found\nmyself in the sitting-room once more. My \ufb01rst impression as I opened the door was\nthat a \ufb01re had broken out, for the room was so\n\ufb01lled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon\nthe table was blurred by it. As I entered, how-\never, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid\nfumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by\nthe throat and set me coughing. Through the haze\nI had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-\ngown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay\npipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay\naround him. \u201cCaught cold, Watson?\u201d said he. \u201cNo, it\u2019s this poisonous atmosphere.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it is pretty thick, now that you men-\ntion it.\u201d\n\u201cThick! It is intolerable.\u201d\n\u201cOpen the window, then! You have been at\nyour club all day, I perceive.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\n\u201cAm I right?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, but how?\u201d\nHe laughed at my bewildered expression. \u201cThere is a delightful freshness about you, Wat-\nson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any\nsmall powers which I possess at your expense. A\ngentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the\ngloss still on his hat and his boots. He has been\na \ufb01xture therefore all day. He is not a man with in-\ntimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not obvious?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is rather obvious.\u201d\n\u201cThe world is full of obvious things which no-\nbody by any chance ever observes. Where do you\nthink that I have been?\u201d\n\u201cA \ufb01xture also.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.\u201d\n\u201cIn spirit?\u201d\n\u201cExactly. My body has remained in this arm-\nchair and has, I regret to observe, consumed in my\nabsence two large pots of coffee and an incredible\namount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to\nStamford\u2019s for the Ordnance map of this portion of\nthe moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day. I \ufb02atter myself that I could \ufb01nd my way about.\u201d\n\u201cA large scale map, I presume?\u201d\n\u201cVery large.\u201d He unrolled one section and held\nit over his knee. \u201cHere you have the particular dis-\ntrict which concerns us."

I fancy the Yew Alley, though not\nmarked under that name, must stretch along this\nline, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right\nof it. This small clump of buildings here is the\nhamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer\nhas his headquarters. Within a radius of \ufb01ve miles\nthere are, as you see, only a very few scattered\ndwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was men-\ntioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated\nhere which may be the residence of the natural-\nist\u2014Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farm-houses, High Tor and\nFoulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great con-\nvict prison of Princetown. Between and around\nthese scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless\nmoor. This, then, is the stage upon which tragedy\nhas been played, and upon which we may help to\nplay it again.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be a wild place.\u201d\n597\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\u201cYes, the setting is a worthy one.

There are two questions waiting for\nus at the outset. The one is whether any crime has\nbeen committed at all; the second is, what is the\ncrime and how was it committed? Of course, if\nDr. Mortimer\u2019s surmise should be correct, and we\nare dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws\nof Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But\nwe are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses be-\nfore falling back upon this one. I think we\u2019ll shut\nthat window again, if you don\u2019t mind. It is a sin-\ngular thing, but I \ufb01nd that a concentrated atmo-\nsphere helps a concentration of thought. I have\nnot pushed it to the length of getting into a box to\nthink, but that is the logical outcome of my con-\nvictions. Have you turned the case over in your\nmind?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have thought a good deal of it in the\ncourse of the day.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d\n\u201cIt is very bewildering.\u201d\n\u201cIt has certainly a character of its own. There\nare points of distinction about it. That change in\nthe footprints, for example. What do you make of\nthat?\u201d\n\u201cMortimer said that the man had walked on\ntiptoe down that portion of the alley.\u201d\n\u201cHe only repeated what some fool had said at\nthe inquest. Why should a man walk on tiptoe\ndown the alley?\u201d\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\u201cHe was running, Watson\u2014running desper-\nately, running for his life, running until he burst\nhis heart and fell dead upon his face.\u201d\n\u201cRunning from what?\u201d\n\u201cThere lies our problem. There are indications\nthat the man was crazed with fear before ever he\nbegan to run.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d\n\u201cI am presuming that the cause of his fears\ncame to him across the moor."

Our clients were punctual to\ntheir appointment, for the clock had just struck\nten when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed\nby the young baronet. The latter was a small, alert,\ndark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very stur-\ndily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong,\npugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed\nsuit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one\n598\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nwho has spent most of his time in the open air, and\nyet there was something in his steady eye and the\nquiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the\ngentleman. \u201cThis is Sir Henry Baskerville,\u201d said Dr. Mor-\ntimer. \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d said he, \u201cand the strange thing is,\nMr. Sherlock Holmes, that if my friend here had\nnot proposed coming round to you this morning\nI should have come on my own account. I under-\nstand that you think out little puzzles, and I\u2019ve had\none this morning which wants more thinking out\nthan I am able to give it.\u201d\n\u201cPray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I under-\nstand you to say that you have yourself had some\nremarkable experience since you arrived in Lon-\ndon?\u201d\n\u201cNothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not. It was this letter, if you\ncan call it a letter, which reached me this morn-\ning.\u201d\nHe laid an envelope upon the table, and we\nall bent over it.

We only decided\nafter I met Dr. Mortimer.\u201d\n\u201cBut Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stop-\nping there?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I had been staying with a friend,\u201d said the\ndoctor. \u201cThere was no possible indication that we\nintended to go to this hotel.\u201d\n\u201cHum! Someone seems to be very deeply in-\nterested in your movements.\u201d Out of the envelope\nhe took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into\nfour. This he opened and spread \ufb02at upon the ta-\nble. Across the middle of it a single sentence had\nbeen formed by the expedient of pasting printed\nwords upon it. It ran:\nAs you value your life or your reason\nkeep away from the moor.

Permit\nme to give you an extract from it. \u201c \u2018You may be cajoled into imagining that\nyour own special trade or your own indus-\ntry will be encouraged by a protective tar-\niff, but it stands to reason that such legisla-\ntion must in the long run keep away wealth\nfrom the country, diminish the value of our\nimports, and lower the general conditions\nof life in this island.\u2019\n\u201cWhat do you think of that,\nWatson?\u201d cried\nHolmes in high glee, rubbing his hands together\nwith satisfaction. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that is an ad-\nmirable sentiment?\u201d\nDr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air\nof professional interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville\nturned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about the tariff and things\nof that kind,\u201d said he; \u201cbut it seems to me we\u2019ve\ngot a bit off the trail so far as that note is con-\ncerned.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, I think we are particularly\nhot upon the trail, Sir Henry."

There is as much dif-\nference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois\ntype of a Times article and the slovenly print of\nan evening half-penny paper as there could be be-\ntween your negro and your Esquimau. The de-\ntection of types is one of the most elementary\nbranches of knowledge to the special expert in\ncrime, though I confess that once when I was very\nyoung I confused the Leeds Mercury with the West-\nern Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely\ndistinctive, and these words could have been taken\nfrom nothing else. As it was done yesterday the\nstrong probability was that we should \ufb01nd the\nwords in yesterday\u2019s issue.\u201d\n\u201cSo far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,\u201d\nsaid Sir Henry Baskerville, \u201csomeone cut out this\nmessage with a scissors\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNail-scissors,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou can see that\nit was a very short-bladed scissors, since the cutter\nhad to take two snips over \u2018keep away.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cThat is so. Someone, then, cut out the mes-\nsage with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it\nwith paste\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGum,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWith gum on to the paper. But I want to know\nwhy the word \u2018moor\u2019 should have been written?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he could not \ufb01nd it in print. The other\nwords were all simple and might be found in any\nissue, but \u2018moor\u2019 would be less common.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, of course, that would explain it. Have\nyou read anything else in this message,\nMr.\nHolmes?\u201d\n\u201cThere are one or two indications, and yet the\nutmost pains have been taken to remove all clues."

We may take it, therefore, that the letter\nwas composed by an educated man who wished\nto pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to\nconceal his own writing suggests that that writ-\ning might be known, or come to be known, by\nyou. Again, you will observe that the words are\nnot gummed on in an accurate line, but that some\nare much higher than others. \u2018Life,\u2019 for example\nis quite out of its proper place. That may point to\ncarelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry\nupon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline\nto the latter view, since the matter was evidently\nimportant, and it is unlikely that the composer of\nsuch a letter would be careless. If he were in a\nhurry it opens up the interesting question why he\nshould be in a hurry, since any letter posted up\nto early morning would reach Sir Henry before he\nwould leave his hotel.

It is the\nscienti\ufb01c use of the imagination, but we have al-\nways some material basis on which to start our\nspeculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no\ndoubt, but I am almost certain that this address\nhas been written in a hotel.\u201d\n\u201cHow in the world can you say that?\u201d\n\u201cIf you examine it carefully you will see that\nboth the pen and the ink have given the writer\ntrouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single\nword, and has run dry three times in a short ad-\ndress, showing that there was very little ink in the\nbottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom\nallowed to be in such a state, and the combination\nof the two must be quite rare. But you know the\nhotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get\nanything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in\nsaying that could we examine the waste-paper bas-\nkets of the hotels around Charing Cross until we\nfound the remains of the mutilated Times leader\nwe could lay our hands straight upon the person\nwho sent this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What\u2019s this?\u201d\nHe was carefully examining the foolscap, upon\nwhich the words were pasted, holding it only an\ninch or two from his eyes. \u201cWell?\u201d\n600\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said he, throwing it down. \u201cIt is\na blank half-sheet of paper, without even a water-\nmark upon it.

Among other things I bought these\nbrown boots\u2014gave six dollars for them\u2014and had\none stolen before ever I had them on my feet.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems a singularly useless thing to steal,\u201d\nsaid Sherlock Holmes. \u201cI confess that I share Dr.\nMortimer\u2019s belief that it will not be long before the\nmissing boot is found.\u201d\n\u201cAnd, now, gentlemen,\u201d said the baronet with\ndecision, \u201cit seems to me that I have spoken quite\nenough about the little that I know.

But the practical point which\nwe now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it\nis or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville\nHall.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I not go?\u201d\n\u201cThere seems to be danger.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean danger from this family \ufb01end or\ndo you mean danger from human beings?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that is what we have to \ufb01nd out.\u201d\n601\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\u201cWhichever it is, my answer is \ufb01xed. There is\nno devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man\nupon earth who can prevent me from going to the\nhome of my own people, and you may take that to\nbe my \ufb01nal answer.\u201d His dark brows knitted and\nhis face \ufb02ushed to a dusky red as he spoke. It was\nevident that the \ufb01ery temper of the Baskervilles\nwas not extinct in this their last representative. \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d said he, \u201cI have hardly had time to\nthink over all that you have told me. It\u2019s a big\nthing for a man to have to understand and to de-\ncide at one sitting. I should like to have a quiet\nhour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look\nhere, Mr. Holmes, it\u2019s half-past eleven now and I\nam going back right away to my hotel. Suppose\nyou and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and\nlunch with us at two. I\u2019ll be able to tell you more\nclearly then how this thing strikes me.\u201d\n\u201cIs that convenient to you, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly.\u201d\n\u201cThen you may expect us. Shall I have a cab\ncalled?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer to walk, for this affair has \ufb02urried\nme rather.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,\u201d said his\ncompanion. \u201cThen we meet again at two o\u2019clock."

In an instant\nHolmes had changed from the languid dreamer to\nthe man of action. \u201cYour hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a\nmoment to lose!\u201d He rushed into his room in his\ndressing-gown and was back again in a few sec-\nonds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down\nthe stairs and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and\nBaskerville were still visible about two hundred\nyards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street. \u201cShall I run on and stop them?\u201d\n\u201cNot for the world, my dear Watson. I am per-\nfectly satis\ufb01ed with your company if you will tol-\nerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is certainly\na very \ufb01ne morning for a walk.\u201d\nHe quickened his pace until we had decreased\nthe distance which divided us by about half. Then,\nstill keeping a hundred yards behind, we followed\ninto Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop\nwindow, upon which Holmes did the same. An\ninstant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfac-\ntion, and, following the direction of his eager eyes,\nI saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which\nhad halted on the other side of the street was now\nproceeding slowly onward again. \u201cThere\u2019s our man, Watson! Come along! We\u2019ll\nhave a good look at him, if we can do no more.\u201d\nAt that instant I was aware of a bushy black\nbeard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us\nthrough the side window of the cab. Instantly\nthe trapdoor at the top \ufb02ew up, something was\nscreamed to the driver, and the cab \ufb02ew madly off\ndown Regent Street. Holmes looked eagerly round\nfor another, but no empty one was in sight. Then\nhe dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the\ntraf\ufb01c, but the start was too great, and already the\ncab was out of sight. \u201cThere now!\u201d said Holmes bitterly as he\nemerged panting and white with vexation from the\ntide of vehicles. \u201cWas ever such bad luck and such\nbad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are\nan honest man you will record this also and set it\nagainst my successes!\u201d\n\u201cWho was the man?\u201d\n\u201cI have not an idea.\u201d\n\u201cA spy?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it was evident from what we have heard\nthat Baskerville has been very closely shadowed\nby someone since he has been in town. How\nelse could it be known so quickly that it was the\nNorthumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If\nthey had followed him the \ufb01rst day I argued that\nthey would follow him also the second. You may\nhave observed that I twice strolled over to the win-\ndow while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I remember.\u201d\n\u201cI was looking out for loiterers in the street,\nbut I saw none. We are dealing with a clever man,\nWatson."

They have looked after the Hall for four genera-\ntions now. So far as I know, he and his wife are as\nrespectable a couple as any in the county.\u201d\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d said Baskerville, \u201cit\u2019s clear\nenough that so long as there are none of the family\nat the Hall these people have a mighty \ufb01ne home\nand nothing to do.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true.\u201d\n\u201cDid Barrymore pro\ufb01t at all by Sir Charles\u2019s\nwill?\u201d asked Holmes."

He would also be the heir to\nthe money unless it were willed otherwise by the\npresent owner, who can, of course, do what he\nlikes with it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd have you made your will, Sir Henry?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I\u2019ve had no time,\nfor it was only yesterday that I learned how mat-\nters stood. But in any case I feel that the money\nshould go with the title and estate. That was my\npoor uncle\u2019s idea. How is the owner going to re-\nstore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has not\nmoney enough to keep up the property? House,\nland, and dollars must go together.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so.

I suppose that by\nSaturday all might be ready?\u201d\n\u201cWould that suit Dr. Watson?\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly.\u201d\n\u201cThen on Saturday, unless you hear to the\ncontrary, we shall meet at the 10.30 train from\nPaddington.\u201d\nWe had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a\ncry, of triumph, and diving into one of the corners\nof the room he drew a brown boot from under a\ncabinet. \u201cMy missing boot!\u201d he cried. \u201cMay all our dif\ufb01culties vanish as easily!\u201d said\nSherlock Holmes. \u201cBut it is a very singular thing,\u201d Dr. Mortimer\nremarked. \u201cI searched this room carefully before\nlunch.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so did I,\u201d said Baskerville. \u201cEvery inch\nof it.\u201d\n\u201cThere was certainly no boot in it then.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case the waiter must have placed it\nthere while we were lunching.\u201d\nThe German was sent for but professed to\nknow nothing of the matter, nor could any in-\nquiry clear it up. Another item had been added\nto that constant and apparently purposeless se-\nries of small mysteries which had succeeded each\nother so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim\nstory of Sir Charles\u2019s death, we had a line of in-\nexplicable incidents all within the limits of two\ndays, which included the receipt of the printed\nletter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the\nloss of the new brown boot, the loss of the old\nblack boot, and now the return of the new brown\nboot."

All afternoon\nand late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and\nthought. Just before dinner two telegrams were handed\nin.

I should not be\nsurprised if this were an answer to my question.\u201d\nThe ring at the bell proved to be something\neven more satisfactory than an answer, however,\nfor the door opened and a rough-looking fellow\nentered who was evidently the man himself. \u201cI got a message from the head of\ufb01ce that a\ngent at this address had been inquiring for 2704,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cI\u2019ve driven my cab this seven years and\nnever a word of complaint. I came here straight\nfrom the Yard to ask you to your face what you\nhad against me.\u201d\n\u201cI have nothing in the world against you, my\ngood man,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cOn the contrary, I have\nhalf a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear\nanswer to my questions.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had a good day and no mistake,\u201d\nsaid the cabman, with a grin. \u201cWhat was it you\nwanted to ask, sir?\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all your name and address, in case I\nwant you again.\u201d\n\u201cJohn Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of Shipley\u2019s Yard, near Waterloo Sta-\ntion.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes made a note of it. \u201cNow, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who\ncame and watched this house at ten o\u2019clock this\nmorning and afterwards followed the two gentle-\nmen down Regent Street.\u201d\nThe man looked surprised and a little embar-\nrassed. \u201cWhy, there\u2019s no good my telling you\nthings, for you seem to know as much as I do al-\nready,\u201d said he. \u201cThe truth is that the gentleman\ntold me that he was a detective and that I was to\nsay nothing about him to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cMy good fellow, this is a very serious busi-\nness, and you may \ufb01nd yourself in a pretty bad\nposition if you try to hide anything from me. You\nsay that your fare told you that he was a detec-\ntive?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did he say this?\u201d\n\u201cWhen he left me.\u201d\n\u201cDid he say anything more?\u201d\n\u201cHe mentioned his name.\u201d\nHolmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me."

I\u2019d put him at forty years of age, and he\nwas of a middle height, two or three inches shorter\nthan you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he\nhad a black beard, cut square at the end, and a\npale face. I don\u2019t know as I could say more than\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cColour of his eyes?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\u201cNothing more that you can remember?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir; nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, here is your half-sovereign.

He knew\nour number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had\nconsulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,\nconjectured that I had got the number of the cab\nand would lay my hands on the driver, and so sent\nback this audacious message. I tell you, Watson,\nthis time we have got a foeman who is worthy of\nour steel. I\u2019ve been checkmated in London. I can\nonly wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I\u2019m\nnot easy in my mind about it.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cAbout sending you.

Yes, my dear fellow, you\nmay laugh, but I give you my word that I shall\nbe very glad to have you back safe and sound in\nBaker Street once more.\u201d\nCHAPTER VI. Baskerville Hall\nSir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were\nready upon the appointed day, and we started as\narranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes\ndrove with me to the station and gave me his last\nparting injunctions and advice. \u201cI will not bias your mind by suggesting theo-\nries or suspicions, Watson,\u201d said he; \u201cI wish you\nsimply to report facts in the fullest possible man-\nner to me, and you can leave me to do the theoriz-\ning.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of facts?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnything which may seem to have a bear-\ning however indirect upon the case, and especially\nthe relations between young Baskerville and his\nneighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the\ndeath of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries\nmyself in the last few days, but the results have,\nI fear, been negative. One thing only appears to\nbe certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond,\nwho is the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of\na very amiable disposition, so that this persecu-\ntion does not arise from him. I really think that\nwe may eliminate him entirely from our calcula-\ntions. There remain the people who will actually\nsurround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.\u201d\n\u201cWould it not be well in the \ufb01rst place to get\nrid of this Barrymore couple?\u201d\n\u201cBy no means. You could not make a greater\nmistake. If they are innocent it would be a cruel in-\njustice, and if they are guilty we should be giving\nup all chance of bringing it home to them. No, no,\nwe will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there is a groom at the Hall, if I remember\nright. There are two moorland farmers. There is\nour friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be en-\ntirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we\nknow nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton,\nand there is his sister, who is said to be a young\nlady of attractions. There is Mr. Frankland, of\nLafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor, and\n608\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nthere are one or two other neighbours."

Keep your revolver near you\nnight and day, and never relax your precautions.\u201d\nOur friends had already secured a \ufb01rst-class\ncarriage and were waiting for us upon the plat-\nform. \u201cNo, we have no news of any kind,\u201d said Dr.\nMortimer in answer to my friend\u2019s questions. \u201cI\ncan swear to one thing, and that is that we have not\nbeen shadowed during the last two days. We have\nnever gone out without keeping a sharp watch,\nand no one could have escaped our notice.\u201d\n\u201cYou have always kept together, I presume?\u201d\n\u201cExcept yesterday afternoon.

Some\ngreat misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you\nget your other boot?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, it is gone forever.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-\nbye,\u201d he added as the train began to glide down\nthe platform. \u201cBear in mind, Sir Henry, one of the\nphrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mor-\ntimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those\nhours of darkness when the powers of evil are ex-\nalted.\u201d\nI looked back at the platform when we had left\nit far behind, and saw the tall, austere \ufb01gure of\nHolmes standing motionless and gazing after us. The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I\nspent it in making the more intimate acquaintance\nof my two companions and in playing with Dr.\nMortimer\u2019s spaniel. In a very few hours the brown\nearth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to\ngranite, and red cows grazed in well-hedged \ufb01elds\nwhere the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegeta-\ntion spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young\nBaskerville stared eagerly out of the window, and\ncried aloud with delight as he recognized the fa-\nmiliar features of the Devon scenery. \u201cI\u2019ve been over a good part of the world since I\nleft it, Dr. Watson,\u201d said he; \u201cbut I have never seen\na place to compare with it.\u201d\n\u201cI never saw a Devonshire man who did not\nswear by his county,\u201d I remarked. \u201cIt depends upon the breed of men quite as\nmuch as on the county,\u201d said Dr. Mortimer. \u201cA\nglance at our friend here reveals the rounded head\nof the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthu-\nsiasm and power of attachment.

Thence\nI went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it\nis all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I\u2019m\nas keen as possible to see the moor.\u201d\n\u201cAre you? Then your wish is easily granted,\nfor there is your \ufb01rst sight of the moor,\u201d said Dr.\nMortimer, pointing out of the carriage window. Over the green squares of the \ufb01elds and the low\ncurve of a wood there rose in the distance a gray,\nmelancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit,\ndim and vague in the distance, like some fantas-\ntic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long\ntime, his eyes \ufb01xed upon it, and I read upon his ea-\nger face how much it meant to him, this \ufb01rst sight\nof that strange spot where the men of his blood\nhad held sway so long and left their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American\naccent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage,\nand yet as I looked at his dark and expressive face\nI felt more than ever how true a descendant he was\nof that long line of high-blooded, \ufb01ery, and master-\nful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in\nhis thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large\nhazel eyes. If on that forbidding moor a dif\ufb01cult\nand dangerous quest should lie before us, this was\nat least a comrade for whom one might venture to\ntake a risk with the certainty that he would bravely\nshare it. The train pulled up at a small wayside station\nand we all descended. Outside, beyond the low,\nwhite fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs was\nwaiting. Our coming was evidently a great event,\nfor station-master and porters clustered round us\nto carry out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple\ncountry spot, but I was surprised to observe that\nby the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark\nuniforms, who leaned upon their short ri\ufb02es and\n609\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nglanced keenly at us as we passed. The coach-\nman, a hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir\nHenry Baskerville, and in a few minutes we were\n\ufb02ying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling\npasture lands curved upward on either side of us,\nand old gabled houses peeped out from amid the\nthick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and\nsunlit country-side there rose ever, dark against\nthe evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the\nmoor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills. The wagonette swung round into a side road,\nand we curved upward through deep lanes worn\nby centuries of wheels, high banks on either\nside, heavy with dripping moss and \ufb02eshy hart\u2019s-\ntongue ferns."

Still\nsteadily rising, we passed over a narrow gran-\nite bridge, and skirted a noisy stream which\ngushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid\nthe gray boulders. Both road and stream wound\nup through a valley dense with scrub oak and\n\ufb01r. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation\nof delight, looking eagerly about him and asking\ncountless questions. To his eyes all seemed beauti-\nful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the\ncountry-side, which bore so clearly the mark of the\nwaning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and\n\ufb02uttered down upon us as we passed. The rat-\ntle of our wheels died away as we drove through\ndrifts of rotting vegetation\u2014sad gifts, as it seemed\nto me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of\nthe returning heir of the Baskervilles. \u201cHalloa!\u201d cried Dr. Mortimer, \u201cwhat is this?\u201d\nA steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying\nspur of the moor, lay in front of us. On the summit,\nhard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its\npedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern,\nhis ri\ufb02e poised ready over his forearm. He was\nwatching the road along which we travelled. \u201cWhat is this, Perkins?\u201d asked Dr. Mortimer. Our driver half turned in his seat. \u201cThere\u2019s a convict escaped from Princetown,\nsir. He\u2019s been out three days now, and the warders\nwatch every road and every station, but they\u2019ve\nhad no sight of him yet. The farmers about here\ndon\u2019t like it, sir, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I understand that they get \ufb01ve pounds if\nthey can give information.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, but the chance of \ufb01ve pounds is but a\npoor thing compared to the chance of having your\nthroat cut. You see, it isn\u2019t like any ordinary con-\nvict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWho is he, then?\u201d\n\u201cIt is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.\u201d\nI remembered the case well, for it was one in\nwhich Holmes had taken an interest on account\nof the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wan-\nton brutality which had marked all the actions of\nthe assassin. The commutation of his death sen-\ntence had been due to some doubts as to his com-\nplete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our\nwagonette had topped a rise and in front of us\nrose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with\ngnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind\nswept down from it and set us shivering. Some-\nwhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurk-\ning this \ufb01endish man, hiding in a burrow like a\nwild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the\nwhole race which had cast him out. It needed\nbut this to complete the grim suggestiveness of\nthe barren waste, the chilling wind, and the dark-\nling sky. Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his\novercoat more closely around him. We had left the fertile country behind and be-\nneath us."

The road in front of us grew bleaker and\nwilder over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled\nwith giant boulders. Now and then we passed a\nmoorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone,\nwith no creeper to break its harsh outline. Sud-\ndenly we looked down into a cup-like depression,\npatched with stunted oaks and \ufb01rs which had been\ntwisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two\nhigh, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver\npointed with his whip. \u201cBaskerville Hall,\u201d said he. Its master had risen and was staring with\n\ufb02ushed cheeks and shining eyes. A few min-\nutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a\nmaze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with\nweather-bitten pillars on either side, blotched with\nlichens, and surmounted by the boars\u2019 heads of the\nBaskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black gran-\nite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a\nnew building, half constructed, the \ufb01rst fruit of Sir\nCharles\u2019s South African gold. Through the gateway we passed into the av-\nenue, where the wheels were again hushed amid\nthe leaves, and the old trees shot their branches\nin a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville\nshuddered as he looked up the long, dark drive\nto where the house glimmered like a ghost at the\nfarther end. \u201cWas it here?\u201d he asked in a low voice. 610\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\u201cNo, no, the Yew Alley is on the other side.\u201d\nThe young heir glanced round with a gloomy\nface. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were\ncoming on him in such a place as this,\u201d said he. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to scare any man. I\u2019ll have a row of\nelectric lamps up here inside of six months, and\nyou won\u2019t know it again, with a thousand candle-\npower Swan and Edison right here in front of the\nhall door.\u201d\nThe avenue opened into a broad expanse of\nturf, and the house lay before us. In the fad-\ning light I could see that the centre was a heavy\nblock of building from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in ivy, with a patch\nclipped bare here and there where a window or a\ncoat-of-arms broke through the dark veil. From\nthis central block rose the twin towers, ancient,\ncrenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To\nright and left of the turrets were more modern\nwings of black granite. A dull light shone through\nheavy mullioned windows, and from the high\nchimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled\nroof there sprang a single black column of smoke. \u201cWelcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville\nHall!\u201d\nA tall man had stepped from the shadow of the\nporch to open the door of the wagonette."

The light beat upon\nhim where he stood, but long shadows trailed\ndown the walls and hung like a black canopy\nabove him. Barrymore had returned from taking\nour luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of us\nnow with the subdued manner of a well-trained\nservant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall,\nhandsome, with a square black beard and pale,\ndistinguished features. \u201cWould you wish dinner to be served at once,\nsir?\u201d\n\u201cIs it ready?\u201d\n\u201cIn a very few minutes, sir. You will \ufb01nd hot\nwater in your rooms. My wife and I will be happy,\nSir Henry, to stay with you until you have made\nyour fresh arrangements, but you will understand\nthat under the new conditions this house will re-\nquire a considerable staff.\u201d\n\u201cWhat new conditions?\u201d\n\u201cI only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very re-\ntired life, and we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have more company,\nand so you will need changes in your household.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean that your wife and you wish to\nleave?\u201d\n\u201cOnly when it is quite convenient to you, sir.\u201d\n\u201cBut your family have been with us for several\ngenerations, have they not? I should be sorry to\nbegin my life here by breaking an old family con-\nnection.\u201d\nI seemed to discern some signs of emotion\nupon the butler\u2019s white face."

But to\ntell the truth, sir, we were both very much attached\nto Sir Charles, and his death gave us a shock and\nmade these surroundings very painful to us.

Sir\nCharles\u2019s generosity has given us the means to do\nso. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to\nyour rooms.\u201d\nA square balustraded gallery ran round the top\nof the old hall, approached by a double stair. From\nthis central point two long corridors extended the\nwhole length of the building, from which all the\n611\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nbedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing\nas Baskerville\u2019s and almost next door to it. These\nrooms appeared to be much more modern than\nthe central part of the house, and the bright paper\nand numerous candles did something to remove\nthe sombre impression which our arrival had left\nupon my mind. But the dining-room which opened out of the\nhall was a place of shadow and gloom. It was\na long chamber with a step separating the dais\nwhere the family sat from the lower portion re-\nserved for their dependents. At one end a min-\nstrel\u2019s gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot\nacross above our heads, with a smoke-darkened\nceiling beyond them. With rows of \ufb02aring torches\nto light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of\nan old-time banquet, it might have softened; but\nnow, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the\nlittle circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one\u2019s\nvoice became hushed and one\u2019s spirit subdued. A\ndim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress,\nfrom the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Re-\ngency, stared down upon us and daunted us by\ntheir silent company. We talked little, and I for one\nwas glad when the meal was over and we were\nable to retire into the modern billiard-room and\nsmoke a cigarette. \u201cMy word, it isn\u2019t a very cheerful place,\u201d said\nSir Henry. \u201cI suppose one can tone down to it, but\nI feel a bit out of the picture at present. I don\u2019t\nwonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived\nall alone in such a house as this. However, if it\nsuits you, we will retire early to-night, and perhaps\nthings may seem more cheerful in the morning.\u201d\nI drew aside my curtains before I went to bed\nand looked out from my window. It opened upon\nthe grassy space which lay in front of the hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung\nin a rising wind. A half moon broke through the\nrifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I saw be-\nyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the\nlong, low curve of the melancholy moor."

I found my-\nself weary and yet wakeful, tossing restlessly from\nside to side, seeking for the sleep which would not\ncome. Far away a chiming clock struck out the\nquarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly si-\nlence lay upon the old house. And then suddenly,\nin the very dead of the night, there came a sound\nto my ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It\nwas the sob of a woman, the muf\ufb02ed, strangling\ngasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sor-\nrow. I sat up in bed and listened intently. The\nnoise could not have been far away and was cer-\ntainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with\nevery nerve on the alert, but there came no other\nsound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the\nivy on the wall. CHAPTER VII. The Stapletons of Merripit House\nThe fresh beauty of the following morning did\nsomething to efface from our minds the grim and\ngray impression which had been left upon both\nof us by our \ufb01rst experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight\n\ufb02ooded in through the high mullioned windows,\nthrowing watery patches of colour from the coats\nof arms which covered them. The dark panelling\nglowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was\nhard to realize that this was indeed the chamber\nwhich had struck such a gloom into our souls\nupon the evening before. \u201cI guess it is ourselves and not the house that\nwe have to blame!\u201d said the baronet. \u201cWe were\ntired with our journey and chilled by our drive,\nso we took a gray view of the place. Now we are\nfresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet it was not entirely a question of imag-\nination,\u201d I answered. \u201cDid you, for example, hap-\npen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing in\nthe night?\u201d\n\u201cThat is curious, for I did when I was half\nasleep fancy that I heard something of the sort. I\nwaited quite a time, but there was no more of it,\nso I concluded that it was all a dream.\u201d\n612\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\u201cI heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was\nreally the sob of a woman.\u201d\n\u201cWe must ask about this right away.\u201d He rang\nthe bell and asked Barrymore whether he could ac-\ncount for our experience. It seemed to me that the\npallid features of the butler turned a shade paler\nstill as he listened to his master\u2019s question. \u201cThere are only two women in the house, Sir\nHenry,\u201d he answered. \u201cOne is the scullery-maid,\nwho sleeps in the other wing. The other is my\nwife, and I can answer for it that the sound could\nnot have come from her.\u201d\nAnd yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that\nafter breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long\ncorridor with the sun full upon her face."

It was she, then, who wept in the\nnight, and if she did so her husband must know\nit. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discov-\nery in declaring that it was not so. Why had he\ndone this? And why did she weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-\nbearded man there was gathering an atmosphere\nof mystery and of gloom. It was he who had been\nthe \ufb01rst to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we\nhad only his word for all the circumstances which\nled up to the old man\u2019s death. Was it possible that\nit was Barrymore after all whom we had seen in\nthe cab in Regent Street? The beard might well\nhave been the same. The cabman had described\na somewhat shorter man, but such an impression\nmight easily have been erroneous. How could I\nsettle the point forever? Obviously the \ufb01rst thing\nto do was to see the Grimpen postmaster, and \ufb01nd\nwhether the test telegram had really been placed\nin Barrymore\u2019s own hands. Be the answer what it\nmight, I should at least have something to report\nto Sherlock Holmes. Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine af-\nter breakfast, so that the time was propitious for\nmy excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four miles\nalong the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a\nsmall gray hamlet, in which two larger buildings,\nwhich proved to be the inn and the house of Dr.\nMortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmas-\nter, who was also the village grocer, had a clear\nrecollection of the telegram. \u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cI had the telegram de-\nlivered to Mr. Barrymore exactly as directed.\u201d\n\u201cWho delivered it?\u201d\n\u201cMy boy here.

If there is any mistake it is for\nMr. Barrymore himself to complain.\u201d\nIt seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any\nfarther, but it was clear that in spite of Holmes\u2019s\nruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not\nbeen in London all the time.

I\nthought of the strange warning clipped out of the\nleading article of the Times. Was that his work\nor was it possibly the doing of someone who was\nbent upon counteracting his schemes? The only\nconceivable motive was that which had been sug-\ngested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be\nscared away a comfortable and permanent home\nwould be secured for the Barrymores. But surely\nsuch an explanation as that would be quite inad-\nequate to account for the deep and subtle schem-\ning which seemed to be weaving an invisible net\nround the young baronet. Holmes himself had\nsaid that no more complex case had come to him in\nall the long series of his sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray, lonely\nroad, that my friend might soon be freed from his\npreoccupations and able to come down to take this\nheavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders. Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the\nsound of running feet behind me and by a voice\nwhich called me by name. I turned, expecting\nto see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a\nstranger who was pursuing me. He was a small,\nslim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, \ufb02axen-haired\nand lean-jawed, between thirty and forty years of\nage, dressed in a gray suit and wearing a straw\n613\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nhat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over\nhis shoulder and he carried a green butter\ufb02y-net\nin one of his hands. \u201cYou will, I am sure, excuse my presumption,\nDr. Watson,\u201d said he, as he came panting up to\nwhere I stood. \u201cHere on the moor we are homely\nfolk and do not wait for formal introductions.

But how did you know me?\u201d\n\u201cI have been calling on Mortimer, and he\npointed you out to me from the window of his\nsurgery as you passed. As our road lay the same\nway I thought that I would overtake you and in-\ntroduce myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the\nworse for his journey?\u201d\n\u201cHe is very well, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cWe were all rather afraid that after the sad\ndeath of Sir Charles the new baronet might refuse\nto live here. It is asking much of a wealthy man\nto come down and bury himself in a place of this\nkind, but I need not tell you that it means a very\ngreat deal to the country-side. Sir Henry has, I\nsuppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?\u201d\n\u201cI do not think that it is likely.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you know the legend of the \ufb01end\ndog which haunts the family?\u201d\n\u201cI have heard it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is extraordinary how credulous the peasants\nare about here!"

Go back and\nnever set foot upon the moor again.\u201d\n\u201cBut I have only just come.\u201d\n\u201cMan, man!\u201d she cried. \u201cCan you not tell when\na warning is for your own good?"

He is very\nrare and seldom found in the late autumn. What\na pity that I should have missed him!\u201d He spoke\nunconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced in-\ncessantly from the girl to me. \u201cYou have introduced yourselves, I can see.\u201d\n\u201cYes.

But you will come on, will you\nnot, and see Merripit House?\u201d\nA short walk brought us to it, a bleak moor-\nland house, once the farm of some grazier in the\nold prosperous days, but now put into repair and\nturned into a modern dwelling. An orchard sur-\nrounded it, but the trees, as is usual upon the\nmoor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of\nthe whole place was mean and melancholy. We\nwere admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated\nold manservant, who seemed in keeping with the\nhouse. Inside, however, there were large rooms\nfurnished with an elegance in which I seemed\nto recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked\nfrom their windows at the interminable granite-\n\ufb02ecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest hori-\nzon I could not but marvel at what could have\nbrought this highly educated man and this beauti-\nful woman to live in such a place. \u201cQueer spot to choose, is it not?\u201d said he as if\nin answer to my thought. \u201cAnd yet we manage to\nmake ourselves fairly happy, do we not, Beryl?\u201d\n\u201cQuite happy,\u201d said she, but there was no ring\nof conviction in her words. \u201cI had a school,\u201d said Stapleton. \u201cIt was in the\nnorth country. The work to a man of my temper-\nament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the\nprivilege of living with youth, of helping to mould\nthose young minds, and of impressing them with\none\u2019s own character and ideals, was very dear to\nme."

All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon\nyour head by your expression as you surveyed the\nmoor out of our window.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly did cross my mind that it might be\na little dull\u2014less for you, perhaps, than for your\nsister.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I am never dull,\u201d said she, quickly. \u201cWe have books, we have our studies, and we\nhave interesting neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a\nmost learned man in his own line. Poor Sir Charles\nwas also an admirable companion. We knew him\nwell, and miss him more than I can tell.

By the\ntime that you have looked through them lunch will\nbe almost ready.\u201d\nBut I was eager to get back to my charge. The\nmelancholy of the moor, the death of the unfor-\ntunate pony, the weird sound which had been as-\nsociated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles,\nall these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less vague im-\npressions there had come the de\ufb01nite and distinct\nwarning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such in-\ntense earnestness that I could not doubt that some\ngrave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all\npressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once\nupon my return journey, taking the grass-grown\npath by which we had come. It seems, however, that there must have been\nsome short cut for those who knew it, for before I\nhad reached the road I was astounded to see Miss\nStapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the\ntrack. Her face was beautifully \ufb02ushed with her\nexertions, and she held her hand to her side. \u201cI have run all the way in order to cut you off,\nDr. Watson,\u201d said she. \u201cI had not even time to put\non my hat.

First Report of Dr. Watson\nFrom this point onward I will follow the course\nof events by transcribing my own letters to Mr.\nSherlock Holmes which lie before me on the ta-\nble. One page is missing, but otherwise they are\nexactly as written and show my feelings and sus-\npicions of the moment more accurately than my\nmemory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can\npossibly do. Baskerville Hall, October 13th. My dear Holmes:\nMy previous letters and telegrams have kept you\npretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in\nthis most God-forsaken corner of the world. The\nlonger one stays here the more does the spirit of\nthe moor sink into one\u2019s soul, its vastness, and also\nits grim charm. When you are once out upon its\nbosom you have left all traces of modern England\nbehind you, but on the other hand you are con-\nscious everywhere of the homes and the work of\nthe prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you\nwalk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with\ntheir graves and the huge monoliths which are\nsupposed to have marked their temples. As you\nlook at their gray stone huts against the scarred\nhill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and\nif you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out\nfrom the low door \ufb01tting a \ufb02int-tipped arrow on\nto the string of his bow, you would feel that his\npresence there was more natural than your own. The strange thing is that they should have lived\nso thickly on what must always have been most\n618\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nunfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could\nimagine that they were some unwarlike and har-\nried race who were forced to accept that which\nnone other would occupy. All this, however, is foreign to the mission on\nwhich you sent me and will probably be very un-\ninteresting to your severely practical mind. I can\nstill remember your complete indifference as to\nwhether the sun moved round the earth or the\nearth round the sun. Let me, therefore, return to\nthe facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville. If you have not had any report within the last\nfew days it is because up to to-day there was noth-\ning of importance to relate. Then a very surpris-\ning circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you\nin due course. But, \ufb01rst of all, I must keep you in\ntouch with some of the other factors in the situa-\ntion. One of these, concerning which I have said lit-\ntle, is the escaped convict upon the moor."

A fortnight\nhas passed since his \ufb02ight, during which he has\nnot been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could have held\nout upon the moor during all that time. Of course,\nso far as his concealment goes there is no dif\ufb01-\nculty at all. Any one of these stone huts would\ngive him a hiding-place. But there is nothing to\neat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of\nthe moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has\ngone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in\nconsequence. We are four able-bodied men in this household,\nso that we could take good care of ourselves, but\nI confess that I have had uneasy moments when\nI have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles\nfrom any help. There are one maid, an old manser-\nvant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a\nvery strong man. They would be helpless in the\nhands of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill\ncriminal, if he could once effect an entrance. Both\nSir Henry and I were concerned at their situa-\ntion, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom\nshould go over to sleep there, but Stapleton would\nnot hear of it. The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins\nto display a considerable interest in our fair neigh-\nbour. It is not to be wondered at, for time hangs\nheavily in this lonely spot to an active man like\nhim, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful\nwoman. There is something tropical and exotic\nabout her which forms a singular contrast to her\ncool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives\nthe idea of hidden \ufb01res. He has certainly a very\nmarked in\ufb02uence over her, for I have seen her con-\ntinually glance at him as she talked as if seeking\napprobation for what she said. I trust that he is\nkind to her. There is a dry glitter in his eyes, and a\n\ufb01rm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive\nand possibly a harsh nature. You would \ufb01nd him\nan interesting study. He came over to call upon Baskerville on that\n\ufb01rst day, and the very next morning he took us\nboth to show us the spot where the legend of the\nwicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of some miles across the moor\nto a place which is so dismal that it might have\nsuggested the story. We found a short valley be-\ntween rugged tors which led to an open, grassy\nspace \ufb02ecked over with the white cotton grass. In\nthe middle of it rose two great stones, worn and\nsharpened at the upper end, until they looked like\nthe huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the\nold tragedy."

He spoke\nlightly, but it was evident that he was very much in\nearnest. Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but\nit was easy to see that he said less than he might,\nand that he would not express his whole opinion\nout of consideration for the feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suf-\nfered from some evil in\ufb02uence, and he left us with\nthe impression that he shared the popular view\nupon the matter. On our way back we stayed for lunch at Mer-\nripit House, and it was there that Sir Henry made\nthe acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From the\n\ufb01rst moment that he saw her he appeared to be\nstrongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken\nif the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her\nagain and again on our walk home, and since then\nhardly a day has passed that we have not seen\nsomething of the brother and sister. They dine\nhere to-night, and there is some talk of our go-\ning to them next week. One would imagine that\nsuch a match would be very welcome to Stapleton,\nand yet I have more than once caught a look of\nthe strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir\nHenry has been paying some attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would\nlead a lonely life without her, but it would seem\nthe height of sel\ufb01shness if he were to stand in the\nway of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I\nam certain that he does not wish their intimacy to\n619\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nripen into love, and I have several times observed\nthat he has taken pains to prevent them from be-\ning t\u02c6ete-`a-t\u02c6ete. By the way, your instructions to me\nnever to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will be-\ncome very much more onerous if a love affair were\nto be added to our other dif\ufb01culties. My popular-\nity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your\norders to the letter. The other day\u2014Thursday,\nto be more ex-\nact\u2014Dr. Mortimer lunched with us. He has been\nexcavating a barrow at Long Down, and has got\na prehistoric skull which \ufb01lls him with great joy. Never was there such a single-minded enthusiast\nas he! The Stapletons came in afterwards, and\nthe good doctor took us all to the Yew Alley, at\nSir Henry\u2019s request, to show us exactly how ev-\nerything occurred upon that fatal night. It is a\nlong, dismal walk, the Yew Alley, between two\nhigh walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band\nof grass upon either side. At the far end is an old\ntumble-down summer-house. Half-way down is\nthe moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his\ncigar-ash."

As the old man stood there he\nsaw something coming across the moor, something\nwhich terri\ufb01ed him so that he lost his wits, and ran\nand ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaus-\ntion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down\nwhich he \ufb02ed. And from what? A sheep-dog of\nthe moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and\nmonstrous? Was there a human agency in the mat-\nter? Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more\nthan he cared to say? It was all dim and vague, but\nalways there is the dark shadow of crime behind\nit. One other neighbour I have met since I wrote\nlast. This is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who\nlives some four miles to the south of us. He is an\nelderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent\na large fortune in litigation. He \ufb01ghts for the mere\npleasure of \ufb01ghting and is equally ready to take\nup either side of a question, so that it is no wonder\nthat he has found it a costly amusement. Some-\ntimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the\nparish to make him open it. At others he will with\nhis own hands tear down some other man\u2019s gate\nand declare that a path has existed there from time\nimmemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him\nfor trespass. He is learned in old manorial and\ncommunal rights, and he applies his knowledge\nsometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy\nand sometimes against them, so that he is period-\nically either carried in triumph down the village\nstreet or else burned in ef\ufb01gy, according to his lat-\nest exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits\nupon his hands at present, which will probably\nswallow up the remainder of his fortune and so\ndraw his sting and leave him harmless for the fu-\nture. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-\nnatured person, and I only mention him because\nyou were particular that I should send some de-\nscription of the people who surround us. He is\ncuriously employed at present, for, being an am-\nateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope,\nwith which he lies upon the roof of his own house\nand sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catch-\ning a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would\ncon\ufb01ne his energies to this all would be well, but\nthere are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr.\nMortimer for opening a grave without the consent\nof the next-of-kin, because he dug up the Neolithic\nskull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to\nkeep our lives from being monotonous and gives a\nlittle comic relief where it is badly needed."

First of all about the test telegram, which you\nsent from London in order to make sure that Bar-\nrymore was really here. I have already explained\nthat the testimony of the postmaster shows that the\ntest was worthless and that we have no proof one\nway or the other. I told Sir Henry how the matter\nstood, and he at once, in his downright fashion,\nhad Barrymore up and asked him whether he had\nreceived the telegram himself.

Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is\na heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely re-\nspectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You\ncould hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet\nI have told you how, on the \ufb01rst night here, I\nheard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have\nmore than once observed traces of tears upon her\nface. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory\nwhich haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barry-\nmore of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt\nthat there was something singular and question-\nable in this man\u2019s character, but the adventure of\nlast night brings all my suspicions to a head. And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper,\nand since I have been on guard in this house my\nslumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night,\nabout two in the morning, I was aroused by a\nstealthy step passing my room. I rose, opened my\ndoor, and peeped out. A long black shadow was\ntrailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a man\nwho walked softly down the passage with a can-\ndle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers,\nwith no covering to his feet. I could merely see the\noutline, but his height told me that it was Barry-\nmore."

I waited until he\nhad passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached\nthe end of the farther corridor, and I could see\nfrom the glimmer of light through an open door\nthat he had entered one of the rooms. Now, all\nthese rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied, so\nthat his expedition became more mysterious than\never. The light shone steadily as if he were stand-\ning motionless. I crept down the passage as noise-\nlessly as I could and peeped round the corner of\nthe door. Barrymore was crouching at the window with\nthe candle held against the glass. His pro\ufb01le was\nhalf turned towards me, and his face seemed to\nbe rigid with expectation as he stared out into the\nblackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood\nwatching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and\nwith an impatient gesture he put out the light. In-\nstantly I made my way back to my room, and very\nshortly came the stealthy steps passing once more\nupon their return journey. Long afterwards when\nI had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn\nsomewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence\nthe sound came.

My dear Holmes:\nIf I was compelled to leave you without much\nnews during the early days of my mission you\nmust acknowledge that I am making up for lost\ntime, and that events are now crowding thick and\nfast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my\ntop note with Barrymore at the window, and now\nI have quite a budget already which will, unless\nI am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things have taken a turn which I could not have\nanticipated. In some ways they have within the\nlast forty-eight hours become much clearer and in\n621\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nsome ways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you shall judge for your-\nself. Before breakfast on the morning following my\nadventure I went down the corridor and examined\nthe room in which Barrymore had been on the\nnight before."

That would have accounted for\nhis stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness\nof his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow,\nvery well equipped to steal the heart of a country\ngirl, so that this theory seemed to have something\nto support it. That opening of the door which I\nhad heard after I had returned to my room might\nmean that he had gone out to keep some clandes-\ntine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the\nmorning, and I tell you the direction of my suspi-\ncions, however much the result may have shown\nthat they were unfounded. But whatever the true explanation of Barry-\nmore\u2019s movements might be, I felt that the respon-\nsibility of keeping them to myself until I could ex-\nplain them was more than I could bear. I had an\ninterview with the baronet in his study after break-\nfast, and I told him all that I had seen. He was less\nsurprised than I had expected. \u201cI knew that Barrymore walked about nights,\nand I had a mind to speak to him about it,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cTwo or three times I have heard his steps in\nthe passage, coming and going, just about the hour\nyou name.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps then he pays a visit every night to that\nparticular window,\u201d I suggested. \u201cPerhaps he does. If so, we should be able to\nshadow him, and see what it is that he is after. I\nwonder what your friend Holmes would do, if he\nwere here.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that he would do exactly what you\nnow suggest,\u201d said I. \u201cHe would follow Barrymore\nand see what he did.\u201d\n\u201cThen we shall do it together.\u201d\n\u201cBut surely he would hear us.\u201d\n\u201cThe man is rather deaf, and in any case we\nmust take our chance of that. We\u2019ll sit up in my\nroom to-night and wait until he passes.\u201d Sir Henry\nrubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evi-\ndent that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his\nsomewhat quiet life upon the moor. The baronet has been in communication with\nthe architect who prepared the plans for Sir\nCharles, and with a contractor from London, so\nthat we may expect great changes to begin here\nsoon."

When\nthe house is renovated and refurnished, all that he\nwill need will be a wife to make it complete. Be-\ntween ourselves there are pretty clear signs that\nthis will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for\nI have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a\nwoman than he is with our beautiful neighbour,\nMiss Stapleton. And yet the course of true love\ndoes not run quite as smoothly as one would un-\nder the circumstances expect. To-day, for example,\nits surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple,\nwhich has caused our friend considerable perplex-\nity and annoyance. After the conversation which I have quoted\nabout Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and\nprepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the\nsame. \u201cWhat, are you coming, Watson?\u201d he asked,\nlooking at me in a curious way. \u201cThat depends on whether you are going on\nthe moor,\u201d said I. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know what my instructions are. I\nam sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly\nHolmes insisted that I should not leave you, and\nespecially that you should not go alone upon the\nmoor.\u201d\nSir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with\na pleasant smile. \u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d said he, \u201cHolmes, with all\nhis wisdom, did not foresee some things which\nhave happened since I have been on the moor. You\nunderstand me? I am sure that you are the last\nman in the world who would wish to be a spoil-\nsport. I must go out alone.\u201d\nIt put me in a most awkward position. I was at\na loss what to say or what to do, and before I had\nmade up my mind he picked up his cane and was\ngone. 622\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nBut when I came to think the matter over my\nconscience reproached me bitterly for having on\nany pretext allowed him to go out of my sight. I\nimagined what my feelings would be if I had to\nreturn to you and to confess that some misfortune\nhad occurred through my disregard for your in-\nstructions. I assure you my cheeks \ufb02ushed at the\nvery thought. It might not even now be too late to\novertake him, so I set off at once in the direction of\nMerripit House. I hurried along the road at the top of my speed\nwithout seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came\nto the point where the moor path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the\nwrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from\nwhich I could command a view\u2014the same hill\nwhich is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw\nhim at once. He was on the moor path, about a\nquarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side\nwho could only be Miss Stapleton."

They\nwere walking slowly along in deep conversation,\nand I saw her making quick little movements of\nher hands as if she were very earnest in what she\nwas saying, while he listened intently, and once\nor twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood\namong the rocks watching them, very much puz-\nzled as to what I should do next. To follow them\nand break into their intimate conversation seemed\nto be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never\nfor an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the\nspy upon a friend was a hateful task. Still, I could\nsee no better course than to observe him from the\nhill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to\nhim afterwards what I had done. It is true that\nif any sudden danger had threatened him I was\ntoo far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that\nyou will agree with me that the position was very\ndif\ufb01cult, and that there was nothing more which I\ncould do. Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted\non the path and were standing deeply absorbed\nin their conversation, when I was suddenly aware\nthat I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of green \ufb02oating in the air caught my eye,\nand another glance showed me that it was carried\non a stick by a man who was moving among the\nbroken ground. It was Stapleton with his butter\ufb02y-\nnet. He was very much closer to the pair than I\nwas, and he appeared to be moving in their di-\nrection. At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew\nMiss Stapleton to his side. His arm was round\nher, but it seemed to me that she was straining\naway from him with her face averted. He stooped\nhis head to hers, and she raised one hand as if in\nprotest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and\nturn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of\nthe interruption. He was running wildly towards\nthem, his absurd net dangling behind him. He\ngesticulated and almost danced with excitement in\nfront of the lovers. What the scene meant I could\nnot imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton\nwas abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations,\nwhich became more angry as the other refused to\naccept them. The lady stood by in haughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beck-\noned in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after\nan irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the\nside of her brother. The naturalist\u2019s angry gestures\nshowed that the lady was included in his displea-\nsure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after\nthem, and then he walked slowly back the way that\nhe had come, his head hanging, the very picture of\ndejection. What all this meant I could not imagine, but\nI was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so inti-\nmate a scene without my friend\u2019s knowledge."

His face was \ufb02ushed with anger and\nhis brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his\nwit\u2019s ends what to do. \u201cHalloa, Watson! Where have you dropped\nfrom?\u201d said he. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say that you\ncame after me in spite of all?\u201d\nI explained everything to him: how I had found\nit impossible to remain behind, how I had followed\nhim, and how I had witnessed all that had oc-\ncurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but\nmy frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at\nlast into a rather rueful laugh. \u201cYou would have thought the middle of that\nprairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cbut, by thunder, the whole country-side\nseems to have been out to see me do my woo-\ning\u2014and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where\nhad you engaged a seat?\u201d\n\u201cI was on that hill.\u201d\n\u201cQuite in the back row, eh? But her brother was\nwell up to the front. Did you see him come out on\nus?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\u201cDid he ever strike you as being crazy\u2014this\nbrother of hers?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that he ever did.\u201d\n\u201cI dare say not. I always thought him sane\nenough until to-day, but you can take it from me\nthat either he or I ought to be in a strait-jacket. 623\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nWhat\u2019s the matter with me, anyhow? You\u2019ve lived\nnear me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight,\nnow! Is there anything that would prevent me\nfrom making a good husband to a woman that I\nloved?\u201d\n\u201cI should say not.\u201d\n\u201cHe can\u2019t object to my worldly position, so it\nmust be myself that he has this down on. What\nhas he against me? I never hurt man or woman in\nmy life that I know of. And yet he would not so\nmuch as let me touch the tips of her \ufb01ngers.\u201d\n\u201cDid he say so?\u201d\n\u201cThat, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson,\nI\u2019ve only known her these few weeks, but from the\n\ufb01rst I just felt that she was made for me, and she,\ntoo\u2014she was happy when she was with me, and\nthat I\u2019ll swear. There\u2019s a light in a woman\u2019s eyes\nthat speaks louder than words. But he has never\nlet us get together, and it was only to-day for the\n\ufb01rst time that I saw a chance of having a few words\nwith her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when\nshe did it was not love that she would talk about,\nand she wouldn\u2019t have let me talk about it either if\nshe could have stopped it. She kept coming back\nto it that this was a place of danger, and that she\nwould never be happy until I had left it. I told\nher that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to\nleave it, and that if she really wanted me to go,\nthe only way to work it was for her to arrange to\ngo with me."

He was just white\nwith rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing\nwith fury. What was I doing with the lady? How\ndared I offer her attentions which were distasteful\nto her? Did I think that because I was a baronet\nI could do what I liked? If he had not been her\nbrother I should have known better how to answer\nhim. As it was I told him that my feelings towards\nhis sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and\nthat I hoped that she might honour me by becom-\ning my wife. That seemed to make the matter no\nbetter, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered\nhim rather more hotly than I should perhaps, con-\nsidering that she was standing by. So it ended by\nhis going off with her, as you saw, and here am I\nas badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just\ntell me what it all means, Watson, and I\u2019ll owe you\nmore than ever I can hope to pay.\u201d\nI tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I\nwas completely puzzled myself. Our friend\u2019s ti-\ntle, his fortune, his age, his character, and his ap-\npearance are all in his favour, and I know noth-\ning against him unless it be this dark fate which\nruns in his family. That his advances should be\nrejected so brusquely without any reference to the\nlady\u2019s own wishes, and that the lady should ac-\ncept the situation without protest, is very amaz-\ning. However, our conjectures were set at rest by\na visit from Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness\nof the morning, and after a long private interview\nwith Sir Henry in his study, the upshot of their\nconversation was that the breach is quite healed,\nand that we are to dine at Merripit House next Fri-\nday as a sign of it. \u201cI don\u2019t say now that he isn\u2019t a crazy man,\u201d\nsaid Sir Henry; \u201cI can\u2019t forget the look in his eyes\nwhen he ran at me this morning, but I must allow\nthat no man could make a more handsome apol-\nogy than he has done.\u201d\n\u201cDid he give any explanation of his conduct?\u201d\n\u201cHis sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough, and I am glad that he\nshould understand her value. They have always\nbeen together, and according to his account he has\nbeen a very lonely man with only her as a compan-\nion, so that the thought of losing her was really ter-\nrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that\nI was becoming attached to her, but when he saw\nwith his own eyes that it was really so, and that\nshe might be taken away from him, it gave him\nsuch a shock that for a time he was not responsi-\nble for what he said or did."

We\nknow now why Stapleton looked with disfavour\nupon his sister\u2019s suitor\u2014even when that suitor\nwas so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And now I\npass on to another thread which I have extricated\nout of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs\nin the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Bar-\nrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the\nwestern lattice window.

I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms\nuntil nearly three o\u2019clock in the morning, but no\nsound of any sort did we hear except the chiming\nclock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy\nvigil, and ended by each of us falling asleep in\nour chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged,\nand we determined to try again. The next night\nwe lowered the lamp, and sat smoking cigarettes\nwithout making the least sound. It was incredible\nhow slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were\nhelped through it by the same sort of patient inter-\nest which the hunter must feel as he watches the\ntrap into which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had almost for the\nsecond time given it up in despair, when in an in-\nstant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs, with\nall our weary senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage. Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it\ndied away in the distance. Then the baronet gently\nopened his door and we set out in pursuit. Al-\nready our man had gone round the gallery, and\nthe corridor was all in darkness."

The sooner we start the better, as the fellow may\nput out his light and be off.\u201d\nIn \ufb01ve minutes we were outside the door, start-\ning upon our expedition. We hurried through the\ndark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the au-\ntumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The\nnight air was heavy with the smell of damp and\ndecay. Now and again the moon peeped out for\nan instant, but clouds were driving over the face\nof the sky, and just as we came out on the moor\na thin rain began to fall. The light still burned\nsteadily in front. \u201cAre you armed?\u201d I asked. \u201cI have a hunting-crop.\u201d\n\u201cWe must close in on him rapidly, for he is said\nto be a desperate fellow. We shall take him by sur-\nprise and have him at our mercy before he can re-\nsist.\u201d\n\u201cI say, Watson,\u201d said the baronet, \u201cwhat would\nHolmes say to this? How about that hour of dark-\nness in which the power of evil is exalted?\u201d\nAs if in answer to his words there rose sud-\ndenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that\nstrange cry which I had already heard upon the\nborders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with\nthe wind through the silence of the night, a long,\ndeep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad\nmoan in which it died away. Again and again it\nsounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,\nwild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve\nand his face glimmered white through the dark-\nness. \u201cMy God, what\u2019s that, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a sound they have on the\nmoor. I heard it once before.\u201d\nIt died away, and an absolute silence closed in\nupon us. We stood straining our ears, but nothing\ncame. \u201cWatson,\u201d said the baronet, \u201cit was the cry of a\nhound.\u201d\nMy blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a\nbreak in his voice which told of the sudden horror\nwhich had seized him. \u201cWhat do they call this sound?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cThe folk on the country-side.\u201d\n\u201cOh, they are ignorant people. Why should\nyou mind what they call it?\u201d\n\u201cTell me, Watson. What do they say of it?\u201d\nI hesitated but could not escape the question. \u201cThey say it is the cry of the Hound of the\nBaskervilles.\u201d\nHe groaned and was silent for a few moments. \u201cA hound it was,\u201d he said, at last, \u201cbut it\nseemed to come from miles away, over yonder, I\nthink.\u201d\n\u201cIt was hard to say whence it came.\u201d\n\u201cIt rose and fell with the wind."

He said that it might be the calling of a strange\nbird.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be\nsome truth in all these stories? Is it possible that\nI am really in danger from so dark a cause? You\ndon\u2019t believe it, do you, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet it was one thing to laugh about it in\nLondon, and it is another to stand out here in the\ndarkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as\nthat. And my uncle! There was the footprint of\nthe hound beside him as he lay. It all \ufb01ts together. I don\u2019t think that I am a coward, Watson, but that\nsound seemed to freeze my very blood.

We after the convict, and\na hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come on! We\u2019ll see it through if all the \ufb01ends of the pit were\nloose upon the moor.\u201d\nWe stumbled slowly along in the darkness,\nwith the black loom of the craggy hills around us,\nand the yellow speck of light burning steadily in\nfront. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance\nof a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes\nthe glimmer seemed to be far away upon the hori-\nzon and sometimes it might have been within a\nfew yards of us. But at last we could see whence\nit came, and then we knew that we were indeed\nvery close. A guttering candle was stuck in a\ncrevice of the rocks which \ufb02anked it on each side\nso as to keep the wind from it and also to pre-\nvent it from being visible, save in the direction of\n627\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nBaskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed\nour approach, and crouching behind it we gazed\nover it at the signal light. It was strange to see\nthis single candle burning there in the middle of\nthe moor, with no sign of life near it\u2014just the one\nstraight yellow \ufb02ame and the gleam of the rock on\neach side of it. \u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d whispered Sir Henry. \u201cWait here. He must be near his light. Let us\nsee if we can get a glimpse of him.\u201d\nThe words were hardly out of my mouth when\nwe both saw him. Over the rocks, in the crevice of\nwhich the candle burned, there was thrust out an\nevil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed\nand scored with vile passions."

The light beneath him was re\ufb02ected in his small,\ncunning eyes which peered \ufb01ercely to right and\nleft through the darkness, like a crafty and savage\nanimal who has heard the steps of the hunters. Something had evidently aroused his suspi-\ncions. It may have been that Barrymore had some\nprivate signal which we had neglected to give, or\nthe fellow may have had some other reason for\nthinking that all was not well, but I could read his\nfears upon his wicked face. Any instant he might\ndash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I\nsprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the\nsame. At the same moment the convict screamed\nout a curse at us and hurled a rock which splin-\ntered up against the boulder which had sheltered\nus. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat,\nstrongly-built \ufb01gure as he sprang to his feet and\nturned to run. At the same moment by a lucky\nchance the moon broke through the clouds. We\nrushed over the brow of the hill, and there was\nour man running with great speed down the other\nside, springing over the stones in his way with the\nactivity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of\nmy revolver might have crippled him, but I had\nbrought it only to defend myself if attacked, and\nnot to shoot an unarmed man who was running\naway. We were both swift runners and in fairly good\ntraining, but we soon found that we had no chance\nof overtaking him. We saw him for a long time\nin the moonlight until he was only a small speck\nmoving swiftly among the boulders upon the side\nof a distant hill. We ran and ran until we were\ncompletely blown, but the space between us grew\never wider. Finally we stopped and sat panting on\ntwo rocks, while we watched him disappearing in\nthe distance. And it was at this moment that there occurred a\nmost strange and unexpected thing. We had risen\nfrom our rocks and were turning to go home, hav-\ning abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was\nlow upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a\ngranite tor stood up against the lower curve of its\nsilver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony\nstatue on that shining back-ground, I saw the \ufb01g-\nure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was\na delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never\nin my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I\ncould judge, the \ufb01gure was that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little separated, his arms\nfolded, his head bowed, as if he were brooding\nover that enormous wilderness of peat and granite\nwhich lay before him."

There\nwas the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the\nlower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no trace\nof that silent and motionless \ufb01gure. I wished to go in that direction and to search\nthe tor, but it was some distance away. The\nbaronet\u2019s nerves were still quivering from that cry,\nwhich recalled the dark story of his family, and\nhe was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He\nhad not seen this lonely man upon the tor and\ncould not feel the thrill which his strange presence\nand his commanding attitude had given to me. \u201cA\nwarder, no doubt,\u201d said he. \u201cThe moor has been\nthick with them since this fellow escaped.\u201d Well,\nperhaps his explanation may be the right one, but\nI should like to have some further proof of it.

October 16th.\u2014A dull and foggy day with\na drizzle of rain. The house is banked in with\nrolling clouds, which rise now and then to show\nthe dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver\nveins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant\nboulders gleaming where the light strikes upon\ntheir wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction after the excite-\nments of the night. I am conscious myself of a\nweight at my heart and a feeling of impending\ndanger\u2014ever present danger, which is the more\nterrible because I am unable to de\ufb01ne it. And have I not cause for such a feeling? Con-\nsider the long sequence of incidents which have all\npointed to some sinister in\ufb02uence which is at work\naround us. There is the death of the last occupant\nof the Hall, ful\ufb01lling so exactly the conditions of\nthe family legend, and there are the repeated re-\nports from peasants of the appearance of a strange\ncreature upon the moor. Twice I have with my\nown ears heard the sound which resembled the\ndistant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impos-\nsible, that it should really be outside the ordinary\nlaws of nature. A spectral hound which leaves\nmaterial footmarks and \ufb01lls the air with its howl-\ning is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may\nfall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also;\nbut if I have one quality upon earth it is common-\nsense, and nothing will persuade me to believe in\nsuch a thing. To do so would be to descend to the\nlevel of these poor peasants, who are not content\nwith a mere \ufb01end dog but must needs describe\nhim with hell-\ufb01re shooting from his mouth and\neyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and\nI am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice\nheard this crying upon the moor. Suppose that\nthere were really some huge hound loose upon it;\nthat would go far to explain everything. But where\ncould such a hound lie concealed, where did it get\nits food, where did it come from, how was it that\nno one saw it by day? It must be confessed that\nthe natural explanation offers almost as many dif-\n\ufb01culties as the other. And always, apart from the\nhound, there is the fact of the human agency in\nLondon, the man in the cab, and the letter which\nwarned Sir Henry against the moor. This at least\nwas real, but it might have been the work of a pro-\ntecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where is\nthat friend or enemy now? Has he remained in\nLondon, or has he followed us down here? Could\nhe\u2014could he be the stranger whom I saw upon\nthe tor? It is true that I have had only the one glance\nat him, and yet there are some things to which I\nam ready to swear."

Barrymore asked leave to speak with Sir\nHenry, and they were closeted in his study some\nlittle time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than\nonce heard the sound of voices raised, and I had\na pretty good idea what the point was which was\nunder discussion. After a time the baronet opened\nhis door and called for me. \u201cBarrymore considers that he has a grievance,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cHe thinks that it was unfair on our part\nto hunt his brother-in-law down when he, of his\nown free will, had told us the secret.\u201d\nThe butler was standing very pale but very col-\nlected before us. \u201cI may have spoken too warmly, sir,\u201d said he,\n\u201cand if I have, I am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised when\nI heard you two gentlemen come back this morn-\ning and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to \ufb01ght against with-\nout my putting more upon his track.\u201d\n\u201cIf you had told us of your own free will\nit would have been a different thing,\u201d said the\nbaronet, \u201cyou only told us, or rather your wife\nonly told us, when it was forced from you and you\ncould not help yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would have taken advan-\ntage of it, Sir Henry\u2014indeed I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThe man is a public danger. There are lonely\nhouses scattered over the moor, and he is a fellow\nwho would stick at nothing. You only want to get a\nglimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Staple-\nton\u2019s house, for example, with no one but himself\nto defend it. There\u2019s no safety for anyone until he\nis under lock and key.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll break into no house, sir. I give you my\nsolemn word upon that."

October\n17th.\u2014All\nday\nto-day\nthe\nrain\npoured down, rustling on the ivy and dripping\nfrom the eaves. I thought of the convict out\nupon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his crimes, he has suffered something\nto atone for them. And then I thought of that\nother one\u2014the face in the cab, the \ufb01gure against\nthe moon. Was he also out in that deluged\u2014the\nunseen watcher, the man of darkness? In the\nevening I put on my waterproof and I walked far\nupon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the\nrain beating upon my face and the wind whistling\nabout my ears. God help those who wander into\nthe great mire now, for even the \ufb01rm uplands are\nbecoming a morass. I found the black tor upon\nwhich I had seen the solitary watcher, and from\nits craggy summit I looked out myself across the\nmelancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted across\ntheir russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured\nclouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in\ngray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the\nmist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose\nabove the trees. They were the only signs of hu-\nman life which I could see, save only those prehis-\ntoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the\nhills. Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely\nman whom I had seen on the same spot two nights\nbefore. As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mor-\ntimer driving in his dog-cart over a rough moor-\nland track which led from the outlying farmhouse\nof Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and\nhardly a day has passed that he has not called at\nthe Hall to see how we were getting on.

L.?\u201d\nHe thought for a few minutes. \u201cNo,\u201d said he. \u201cThere are a few gipsies and\nlabouring folk for whom I can\u2019t answer, but among\nthe farmers or gentry there is no one whose ini-\ntials are those."

Old Frankland the crank?\u201d\n\u201cExactly. She married an artist named Lyons,\nwho came sketching on the moor. He proved to\nbe a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from\nwhat I hear may not have been entirely on one\nside. Her father refused to have anything to do\nwith her because she had married without his con-\nsent, and perhaps for one or two other reasons as\nwell. So, between the old sinner and the young\none the girl has had a pretty bad time.\u201d\n\u201cHow does she live?\u201d\n\u201cI fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance,\nbut it cannot be more, for his own affairs are con-\nsiderably involved. Whatever she may have de-\nserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to\nthe bad. Her story got about, and several of the\npeople here did something to enable her to earn\nan honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir\nCharles for another. I gave a tri\ufb02e myself. It was\nto set her up in a typewriting business.\u201d\nHe wanted to know the object of my inquiries,\nbut I managed to satisfy his curiosity without\ntelling him too much, for there is no reason why\nwe should take anyone into our con\ufb01dence. To-\nmorrow morning I shall \ufb01nd my way to Coombe\nTracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of\nequivocal reputation, a long step will have been\nmade towards clearing one incident in this chain\nof mysteries. I am certainly developing the wis-\ndom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed\nhis questions to an inconvenient extent I asked him\ncasually to what type Frankland\u2019s skull belonged,\nand so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of\nour drive. I have not lived for years with Sherlock\nHolmes for nothing. I have only one other incident to record upon\nthis tempestuous and melancholy day. This was\nmy conversation with Barrymore just now, which\ngives me one more strong card which I can play in\ndue time. Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and\nthe baronet played \u00b4ecart\u00b4e afterwards. The butler\nbrought me my coffee into the library, and I took\nthe chance to ask him a few questions. \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201chas this precious relation of\nyours departed, or is he still lurking out yonder?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has\ngone, for he has brought nothing but trouble here! I\u2019ve not heard of him since I left out food for him\nlast, and that was three days ago.\u201d\n\u201cDid you see him then?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, but the food was gone when next I\nwent that way.\u201d\n\u201cThen he was certainly there?\u201d\n\u201cSo you would think, sir, unless it was the other\nman who took it.\u201d\nI sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and\nstared at Barrymore."

At \ufb01rst he thought\nthat he was the police, but soon he found that he\nhad some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he\nwas, as far as he could see, but what he was doing\nhe could not make out.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where did he say that he lived?\u201d\n\u201cAmong the old houses on the hillside\u2014the\nstone huts where the old folk used to live.\u201d\n\u201cBut how about his food?\u201d\n\u201cSelden found out that he has got a lad who\nworks for him and brings him all he needs.

There, in that hut upon the moor, seems to lie the\nvery centre of that problem which has vexed me\nso sorely. I swear that another day shall not have\npassed before I have done all that man can do to\nreach the heart of the mystery. CHAPTER XI. The Man on the Tor\nThe extract from my private diary which forms\nthe last chapter has brought my narrative up to\nthe 18th of October, a time when these strange\nevents began to move swiftly towards their ter-\nrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few\ndays are indelibly graven upon my recollection,\nand I can tell them without reference to the notes\nmade at the time. I start then from the day which\nsucceeded that upon which I had established two\nfacts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura\nLyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles\nBaskerville and made an appointment with him at\nthe very place and hour that he met his death, the\nother that the lurking man upon the moor was to\nbe found among the stone huts upon the hill-side. With these two facts in my possession I felt that\neither my intelligence or my courage must be de\ufb01-\ncient if I could not throw some further light upon\nthese dark places. I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I\nhad learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening\nbefore, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at\ncards until it was very late. At breakfast, however,\nI informed him about my discovery, and asked\nhim whether he would care to accompany me to\nCoombe Tracey. At \ufb01rst he was very eager to\ncome, but on second thoughts it seemed to both\nof us that if I went alone the results might be bet-\nter. The more formal we made the visit the less\ninformation we might obtain. I left Sir Henry be-\nhind, therefore, not without some prickings of con-\nscience, and drove off upon my new quest. When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins\nto put up the horses, and I made inquiries for the\nlady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no\ndif\ufb01culty in \ufb01nding her rooms, which were central\nand well appointed. A maid showed me in with-\nout ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room\na lady, who was sitting before a Remington type-\nwriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of wel-\ncome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that I\nwas a stranger, and she sat down again and asked\nme the object of my visit. The \ufb01rst impression left by Mrs. Lyons was\none of extreme beauty. Her eyes and hair were\nof the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks,\nthough considerably freckled, were \ufb02ushed with\nthe exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty\npink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose."

There was something\nsubtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of\nexpression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some\nlooseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are after-thoughts. At the mo-\nment I was simply conscious that I was in the pres-\nence of a very handsome woman, and that she was\nasking me the reasons for my visit. I had not quite\nunderstood until that instant how delicate my mis-\nsion was. \u201cI have the pleasure,\u201d said I, \u201cof knowing your\nfather.\u201d It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady\nmade me feel it. \u201cThere is nothing in common between my fa-\nther and me,\u201d she said. \u201cI owe him nothing, and\nhis friends are not mine. If it were not for the late\nSir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts\nI might have starved for all that my father cared.\u201d\n\u201cIt was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville\nthat I have come here to see you.\u201d\nThe freckles started out on the lady\u2019s face. \u201cWhat can I tell you about him?\u201d she asked,\nand her \ufb01ngers played nervously over the stops of\nher typewriter. \u201cYou knew him, did you not?\u201d\n\u201cI have already said that I owe a great deal to\nhis kindness. If I am able to support myself it is\nlargely due to the interest which he took in my\nunhappy situation.\u201d\n\u201cDid you correspond with him?\u201d\nThe lady looked quickly up with an angry\ngleam in her hazel eyes. \u201cWhat is the object of these questions?\u201d she\nasked sharply. \u201cThe object is to avoid a public scandal. It is\nbetter that I should ask them here than that the\nmatter should pass outside our control.\u201d\nShe was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she looked up with something reckless and\nde\ufb01ant in her manner. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll answer,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are your\nquestions?\u201d\n\u201cDid you correspond with Sir Charles?\u201d\n\u201cI certainly wrote to him once or twice to ac-\nknowledge his delicacy and his generosity.\u201d\n\u201cHave you the dates of those letters?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever met him?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\nonce or twice,\nwhen he came into\nCoombe Tracey. He was a very retiring man, and\nhe preferred to do good by stealth.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you saw him so seldom and wrote so\nseldom, how did he know enough about your af-\nfairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has\ndone?\u201d\nShe met my dif\ufb01culty with the utmost readi-\nness. \u201cThere were several gentlemen who knew my\nsad history and united to help me. One was Mr.\nStapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir\nCharles\u2019s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was\nthrough him that Sir Charles learned about my af-\nfairs.\u201d\nI knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had\nmade Stapleton his almoner upon several occa-\nsions, so the lady\u2019s statement bore the impress of\ntruth upon it."

It was unlikely that she would dare to say that\nshe had not been to Baskerville Hall if she really\nhad been, for a trap would be necessary to take\nher there, and could not have returned to Coombe\nTracey until the early hours of the morning. Such\nan excursion could not be kept secret. The proba-\nbility was, therefore, that she was telling the truth,\nor, at least, a part of the truth. I came away baf\ufb02ed\nand disheartened. Once again I had reached that\ndead wall which seemed to be built across every\npath by which I tried to get at the object of my\nmission. And yet the more I thought of the lady\u2019s\nface and of her manner the more I felt that some-\nthing was being held back from me. Why should\nshe turn so pale? Why should she \ufb01ght against ev-\nery admission until it was forced from her? Why\nshould she have been so reticent at the time of the\ntragedy? Surely the explanation of all this could\nnot be as innocent as she would have me believe.

Barrymore\u2019s\nonly indication had been that the stranger lived in\none of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds\nof them are scattered throughout the length and\nbreadth of the moor. But I had my own experience\nfor a guide since it had shown me the man himself\nstanding upon the summit of the Black Tor. That\nthen should be the centre of my search. From there\n635\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nI should explore every hut upon the moor until I\nlighted upon the right one. If this man were in-\nside it I should \ufb01nd out from his own lips, at the\npoint of my revolver if necessary, who he was and\nwhy he had dogged us so long. He might slip\naway from us in the crowd of Regent Street, but it\nwould puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor. On the other hand, if I should \ufb01nd the hut and its\ntenant should not be within it I must remain there,\nhowever long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes\nhad missed him in London. It would indeed be a\ntriumph for me if I could run him to earth, where\nmy master had failed. Luck had been against us again and again in\nthis inquiry, but now at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none\nother than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-\nwhiskered and red-faced, outside the gate of his\ngarden, which opened on to the high road along\nwhich I travelled. \u201cGood-day, Dr. Watson,\u201d cried he with un-\nwonted good humour, \u201cyou must really give your\nhorses a rest, and come in to have a glass of wine\nand to congratulate me.\u201d\nMy feelings towards him were very far from be-\ning friendly after what I had heard of his treatment\nof his daughter, but I was anxious to send Perkins\nand the wagonette home, and the opportunity was\na good one.

It was on his track, and not upon the con-\nvict\u2019s, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get\nhis knowledge it might save me a long and weary\nhunt. But incredulity and indifference were evi-\ndently my strongest cards. \u201cI should say that it was much more likely that\nit was the son of one of the moorland shepherds\ntaking out his father\u2019s dinner.\u201d\nThe least appearance of opposition struck \ufb01re\nout of the old autocrat. His eyes looked malig-\nnantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like\nthose of an angry cat. \u201cIndeed, sir!\u201d said he, pointing out over the\nwide-stretching moor. \u201cDo you see that Black Tor\nover yonder? Well, do you see the low hill be-\nyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest\npart of the whole moor. Is that a place where a\nshepherd would be likely to take his station? Your\nsuggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.\u201d\nI meekly answered that I had spoken without\nknowing all the facts. My submission pleased him\nand led him to further con\ufb01dences. \u201cYou may be sure, sir, that I have very good\ngrounds before I come to an opinion. I have seen\nthe boy again and again with his bundle. Ev-\nery day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been\nable\u2014but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my\neyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment\nsomething moving upon that hill-side?\u201d\nIt was several miles off, but I could distinctly\nsee a small dark dot against the dull green and\ngray. \u201cCome, sir, come!\u201d cried Frankland, rushing\nupstairs. \u201cYou will see with your own eyes and\njudge for yourself.\u201d\nThe\ntelescope,\na\nformidable\ninstrument\nmounted upon a tripod, stood upon the \ufb02at leads\nof the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and\ngave a cry of satisfaction. \u201cQuick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes\nover the hill!\u201d\nThere he was, sure enough, a small urchin with\na little bundle upon his shoulder, toiling slowly\nup the hill. When he reached the crest I saw\nthe ragged uncouth \ufb01gure outlined for an instant\nagainst the cold blue sky. He looked round him\nwith a furtive and stealthy air, as one who dreads\npursuit. Then he vanished over the hill. \u201cWell! Am I right?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, there is a boy who seems to have\nsome secret errand.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what the errand is even a county consta-\nble could guess. But not one word shall they have\nfrom me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr. Wat-\nson. Not a word! You understand!\u201d\n\u201cJust as you wish.\u201d\n\u201cThey have treated me shamefully\u2014shamefully. When the facts come out in Frankland v. Regina\nI venture to think that a thrill of indignation will\nrun through the country. Nothing would induce\nme to help the police in any way. For all they cared\nit might have been me, instead of my ef\ufb01gy, which\nthese rascals burned at the stake."

You will help me to empty the decanter\nin honour of this great occasion!\u201d\nBut I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded\nin dissuading him from his announced intention of\nwalking home with me. I kept the road as long as\nhis eye was on me, and then I struck off across\nthe moor and made for the stony hill over which\nthe boy had disappeared. Everything was work-\ning in my favour, and I swore that it should not\nbe through lack of energy or perseverance that I\nshould miss the chance which fortune had thrown\nin my way. The sun was already sinking when I reached\nthe summit of the hill, and the long slopes beneath\nme were all golden-green on one side and gray\nshadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the\nfarthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic\nshapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide\nexpanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a gull or curlew, soared aloft\nin the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the\nonly living things between the huge arch of the\nsky and the desert beneath it. The barren scene,\nthe sense of loneliness, and the mystery and ur-\ngency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was nowhere to be seen. But down be-\nneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle\nof the old stone huts, and in the middle of them\nthere was one which retained suf\ufb01cient roof to act\nas a screen against the weather. My heart leaped\nwithin me as I saw it. This must be the burrow\nwhere the stranger lurked. At last my foot was on\nthe threshold of his hiding place\u2014his secret was\nwithin my grasp. As I approached the hut, walking as warily as\nStapleton would do when with poised net he drew\nnear the settled butter\ufb02y, I satis\ufb01ed myself that\nthe place had indeed been used as a habitation. 637\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nA vague pathway among the boulders led to the\ndilapidated opening which served as a door. All\nwas silent within. The unknown might be lurking\nthere, or he might be prowling on the moor. My\nnerves tingled with the sense of adventure. Throw-\ning aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the\nbutt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the\ndoor, I looked in. The place was empty. But there were ample signs that I had not come\nupon a false scent. This was certainly where the\nman lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof\nlay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic\nman had once slumbered. The ashes of a \ufb01re were\nheaped in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cook-\ning utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A lit-\nter of empty tins showed that the place had been\noccupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes be-\ncame accustomed to the checkered light, a pan-\nnikin and a half-full bottle of spirits standing in\nthe corner."

It contained a loaf of bread, a tinned\ntongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I\nset it down again, after having examined it, my\nheart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet\nof paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this\nwas what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil:\u2014\nDr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey. For a minute I stood there with the paper in\nmy hands thinking out the meaning of this curt\nmessage. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who\nwas being dogged by this secret man. He had not\nfollowed me himself, but he had set an agent\u2014the\nboy, perhaps\u2014upon my track, and this was his re-\nport. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been\nupon the moor which had not been observed and\nreported. Always there was this feeling of an un-\nseen force, a \ufb01ne net drawn round us with in\ufb01nite\nskill and delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was\nonly at some supreme moment that one realized\nthat one was indeed entangled in its meshes. If there was one report there might be others,\nso I looked round the hut in search of them. There\nwas no trace, however, of anything of the kind, nor\ncould I discover any sign which might indicate the\ncharacter or intentions of the man who lived in\nthis singular place, save that he must be of Spar-\ntan habits and cared little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at\nthe gaping roof I understood how strong and im-\nmutable must be the purpose which had kept him\nin that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant\nenemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel? I\nswore that I would not leave the hut until I knew. Outside the sun was sinking low and the west\nwas blazing with scarlet and gold. Its re\ufb02ection\nwas shot back in ruddy patches by the distant\npools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and\nthere a distant blur of smoke which marked the\nvillage of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the\nhill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweet\nand mellow and peaceful in the golden evening\nlight, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared\nnone of the peace of nature but quivered at the\nvagueness and the terror of that interview which\nevery instant was bringing nearer. With tingling\nnerves, but a \ufb01xed purpose, I sat in the dark recess\nof the hut and waited with sombre patience for the\ncoming of its tenant. And then at last I heard him. Far away came\nthe sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone."

Then\nonce more the footsteps approached and a shadow\nfell across the opening of the hut. \u201cIt is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,\u201d said a\nwell-known voice. \u201cI really think that you will be\nmore comfortable outside than in.\u201d\n638\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nCHAPTER XII. Death on the Moor\nFor a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly\nable to believe my ears.

He was thin and worn, but clear and alert,\nhis keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened\nby the wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he\nlooked like any other tourist upon the moor, and\nhe had contrived, with that cat-like love of per-\nsonal cleanliness which was one of his character-\nistics, that his chin should be as smooth and his\nlinen as perfect as if he were in Baker Street. \u201cI never was more glad to see anyone in my\nlife,\u201d said I, as I wrung him by the hand. \u201cOr more astonished, eh?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I must confess to it.\u201d\n\u201cThe surprise was not all on one side, I assure\nyou. I had no idea that you had found my occa-\nsional retreat, still less that you were inside it, until\nI was within twenty paces of the door.\u201d\n\u201cMy footprint, I presume?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Watson; I fear that I could not under-\ntake to recognize your footprint amid all the foot-\nprints of the world. If you seriously desire to de-\nceive me you must change your tobacconist; for\nwhen I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley,\nOxford Street, I know that my friend Watson is\nin the neighbourhood. You will see it there be-\nside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at\nthat supreme moment when you charged into the\nempty hut.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cI thought as much\u2014and knowing your ad-\nmirable tenacity I was convinced that you were\nsitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting\nfor the tenant to return. So you actually thought\nthat I was the criminal?\u201d\n\u201cI did not know who you were, but I was de-\ntermined to \ufb01nd out.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent, Watson! And how did you localize\nme? You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the con-\nvict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the\nmoon to rise behind me?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I saw you then.\u201d\n\u201cAnd have no doubt searched all the huts until\nyou came to this one?\u201d\n\u201cNo, your boy had been observed, and that\ngave me a guide where to look.\u201d\n\u201cThe old gentleman with the telescope, no\ndoubt."

I felt also in my heart that he was right in what\nhe said and that it was really best for our purpose\nthat I should not have known that he was upon the\nmoor. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said he, seeing the shadow rise\nfrom my face. \u201cAnd now tell me the result of your\nvisit to Mrs. Laura Lyons\u2014it was not dif\ufb01cult for\nme to guess that it was to see her that you had\ngone, for I am already aware that she is the one\nperson in Coombe Tracey who might be of service\nto us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone to-\nday it is exceedingly probable that I should have\ngone to-morrow.\u201d\nThe sun had set and dusk was settling over the\nmoor. The air had turned chill and we withdrew\ninto the hut for warmth. There, sitting together\nin the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation\nwith the lady. So interested was he that I had to\nrepeat some of it twice before he was satis\ufb01ed. \u201cThis is most important,\u201d said he when I had\nconcluded. \u201cIt \ufb01lls up a gap which I had been un-\nable to bridge, in this most complex affair. You\nare aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists be-\ntween this lady and the man Stapleton?\u201d\n\u201cI did not know of a close intimacy.\u201d\n\u201cThere can be no doubt about the matter.

I repeat that the lady is his wife\nand not his sister.\u201d\n\u201cBut why this elaborate deception?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he foresaw that she would be very\nmuch more useful to him in the character of a free\nwoman.\u201d\nAll my unspoken instincts, my vague suspi-\ncions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the\nnaturalist. In that impassive, colourless man, with\nhis straw hat and his butter\ufb02y-net, I seemed to see\nsomething terrible\u2014a creature of in\ufb01nite patience\nand craft, with a smiling face and a murderous\nheart. \u201cIt is he, then, who is our enemy\u2014it is he who\ndogged us in London?\u201d\n\u201cSo I read the riddle.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the warning\u2014it must have come from\nher!\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\nThe shape of some monstrous villainy, half\nseen, half guessed, loomed through the darkness\nwhich had girt me so long."

Uncle and nephew\nhave been murdered\u2014the one frightened to death\nby the very sight of a beast which he thought to\nbe supernatural, the other driven to his end in his\nwild \ufb02ight to escape from it. But now we have\nto prove the connection between the man and the\nbeast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even\nswear to the existence of the latter, since Sir Henry\nhas evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,\ncunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power\nbefore another day is past!\u201d\nWe stood with bitter hearts on either side of\nthe mangled body, overwhelmed by this sudden\nand irrevocable disaster which had brought all\nour long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then, as the moon rose we climbed to the top of\nthe rocks over which our poor friend had fallen,\nand from the summit we gazed out over the shad-\nowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away,\nmiles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single\nsteady yellow light was shining. It could only\ncome from the lonely abode of the Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my \ufb01st at it as I gazed. \u201cWhy should we not seize him at once?\u201d\n\u201cOur case is not complete. The fellow is wary\nand cunning to the last degree. It is not what we\nknow, but what we can prove. If we make one false\nmove the villain may escape us yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d\n\u201cThere will be plenty for us to do to-morrow. To-night we can only perform the last of\ufb01ces to\nour poor friend.\u201d\nTogether we made our way down the precip-\nitous slope and approached the body, black and\nclear against the silvered stones."

Good heavens,\nare you mad?\u201d\nHe had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and laughing and wringing\nmy hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained\nfriend? These were hidden \ufb01res, indeed! \u201cA beard! A beard! The man has a beard!\u201d\n\u201cA beard?\u201d\n\u201cIt is not the baronet\u2014it is\u2014why, it is my\nneighbour, the convict!\u201d\nWith feverish haste we had turned the body\nover, and that dripping beard was pointing up to\nthe cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt\nabout the beetling forehead, the sunken animal\neyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared\nupon me in the light of the candle from over the\nrock\u2014the face of Selden, the criminal. Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I re-\nmembered how the baronet had told me that he\nhad handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore. Bar-\nrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden\nin his escape. Boots, shirt, cap\u2014it was all Sir\nHenry\u2019s. The tragedy was still black enough, but\nthis man had at least deserved death by the laws of\nhis country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,\nmy heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy. \u201cThen the clothes have been the poor devil\u2019s\ndeath,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is clear enough that the\nhound has been laid on from some article of Sir\nHenry\u2019s\u2014the boot which was abstracted in the ho-\ntel, in all probability\u2014and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing, however: How\n642\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\ncame Selden, in the darkness, to know that the\nhound was on his trail?\u201d\n\u201cHe heard him.\u201d\n\u201cTo hear a hound upon the moor would not\nwork a hard man like this convict into such a\nparoxysm of terror that he would risk recapture\nby screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must\nhave run a long way after he knew the animal was\non his track. How did he know?\u201d\n\u201cA greater mystery to me is why this hound,\npresuming that all our conjectures are correct\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI presume nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, why this hound should be loose to-\nnight. I suppose that it does not always run loose\nupon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go un-\nless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would\nbe there.\u201d\n\u201cMy dif\ufb01culty is the more formidable of the\ntwo, for I think that we shall very shortly get an\nexplanation of yours, while mine may remain for-\never a mystery. The question now is, what shall\nwe do with this poor wretch\u2019s body? We cannot\nleave it here to the foxes and the ravens.\u201d\n\u201cI suggest that we put it in one of the huts until\nwe can communicate with the police.\u201d\n\u201cExactly."

He\nstopped when he saw us, and then came on again. \u201cWhy, Dr. Watson, that\u2019s not you, is it? You are\nthe last man that I should have expected to see out\non the moor at this time of night. But, dear me,\nwhat\u2019s this? Somebody hurt? Not\u2014don\u2019t tell me\nthat it is our friend Sir Henry!\u201d He hurried past me\nand stooped over the dead man.

He looked sharply from\nHolmes to me. \u201cDear me! What a very shocking affair! How\ndid he die?\u201d\n\u201cHe appears to have broken his neck by falling\nover these rocks. My friend and I were strolling on\nthe moor when we heard a cry.\u201d\n\u201cI heard a cry also. That was what brought me\nout. I was uneasy about Sir Henry.\u201d\n\u201cWhy about Sir Henry in particular?\u201d I could\nnot help asking. \u201cBecause I had suggested that he should come\nover.

It is said to be\nheard at night upon the moor. I was wondering if\nthere were any evidence of such a sound to-night.\u201d\n\u201cWe heard nothing of the kind,\u201d said I. \u201cAnd what is your theory of this poor fellow\u2019s\ndeath?\u201d\n\u201cI have no doubt that anxiety and exposure\nhave driven him off his head. He has rushed about\nthe moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over\nhere and broken his neck.\u201d\n\u201cThat seems the most reasonable theory,\u201d said\nStapleton, and he gave a sigh which I took to in-\ndicate his relief. \u201cWhat do you think about it, Mr.\nSherlock Holmes?\u201d\nMy friend bowed his compliments. \u201cYou are quick at identi\ufb01cation,\u201d said he. \u201cWe have been expecting you in these parts\nsince Dr. Watson came down. You are in time to\nsee a tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cYes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend\u2019s\nexplanation will cover the facts.

CHAPTER XIII. Fixing the Nets\n\u201cWe\u2019re at close grips at last,\u201d said Holmes as\nwe walked together across the moor. \u201cWhat a\nnerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself to-\ngether in the face of what must have been a para-\nlyzing shock when he found that the wrong man\nhad fallen a victim to his plot.

But there was no getting\nout of it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat effect do you think it will have upon his\nplans now that he knows you are here?\u201d\n\u201cIt may cause him to be more cautious, or it\nmay drive him to desperate measures at once. Like\nmost clever criminals, he may be too con\ufb01dent in\nhis own cleverness and imagine that he has com-\npletely deceived us.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should we not arrest him at once?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Watson, you were born to be a man of\naction. Your instinct is always to do something en-\nergetic. But supposing, for argument\u2019s sake, that\nwe had him arrested to-night, what on earth the\nbetter off should we be for that? We could prove\nnothing against him. There\u2019s the devilish cunning\nof it! If he were acting through a human agent we\ncould get some evidence, but if we were to drag\nthis great dog to the light of day it would not help\nus in putting a rope round the neck of its master.\u201d\n\u201cSurely we have a case.\u201d\n\u201cNot a shadow of one\u2014only surmise and con-\njecture. We should be laughed out of court if we\ncame with such a story and such evidence.\u201d\n\u201cThere is Sir Charles\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cFound dead without a mark upon him. You\nand I know that he died of sheer fright, and we\nknow also what frightened him; but how are we to\nget twelve stolid jurymen to know it?"

He did raise his eyebrows,\nhowever, when he found that my friend had nei-\nther any luggage nor any explanations for its ab-\nsence. Between us we soon supplied his wants,\nand then over a belated supper we explained to the\nbaronet as much of our experience as it seemed de-\nsirable that he should know. But \ufb01rst I had the un-\npleasant duty of breaking the news to Barrymore\nand his wife. To him it may have been an unmit-\nigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he was the man of violence, half\nanimal and half demon; but to her he always re-\nmained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood,\nthe child who had clung to her hand.

Watson,\nyou will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that\nyou regret that you cannot come.\u201d\n\u201cI have a good mind to go to London with\nyou,\u201d said the baronet. \u201cWhy should I stay here\nalone?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it is your post of duty. Because you\ngave me your word that you would do as you were\ntold, and I tell you to stay.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n\u201cOne more direction! I wish you to drive to\nMerripit House. Send back your trap, however,\nand let them know that you intend to walk home.\u201d\n\u201cTo walk across the moor?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBut that is the very thing which you have so\noften cautioned me not to do.\u201d\n\u201cThis time you may do it with safety. If I had\nnot every con\ufb01dence in your nerve and courage I\nwould not suggest it, but it is essential that you\nshould do it.\u201d\n\u201cThen I will do it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as you value your life do not go across\nthe moor in any direction save along the straight\npath which leads from Merripit House to the\nGrimpen Road, and is your natural way home.\u201d\n\u201cI will do just what you say.\u201d\n\u201cVery good. I should be glad to get away as\nsoon after breakfast as possible, so as to reach Lon-\ndon in the afternoon.\u201d\nI was much astounded by this programme,\nthough I remembered that Holmes had said to Sta-\npleton on the night before that his visit would ter-\nminate next day. It had not crossed my mind, how-\never, that he would wish me to go with him, nor\ncould I understand how we could both be absent\nat a moment which he himself declared to be crit-\nical. There was nothing for it, however, but im-\nplicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rue-\nful friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we\nwere at the station of Coombe Tracey and had dis-\npatched the trap upon its return journey. A small\nboy was waiting upon the platform. \u201cAny orders, sir?\u201d\n\u201cYou will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you will send a wire to Sir\nHenry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he\n\ufb01nds the pocket-book which I have dropped he is\nto send it by registered post to Baker Street.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd ask at the station of\ufb01ce if there is a mes-\nsage for me.\u201d\nThe boy returned with a telegram,\nwhich\nHolmes handed to me."

We know that that\nwas the place and hour of his death. You have\nwithheld what the connection is between these\nevents.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no connection.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case the coincidence must indeed be an\nextraordinary one. But I think that we shall suc-\nceed in establishing a connection after all. I wish\nto be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons.

The person who\nhas passed for his sister is really his wife.\u201d\nMrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands\nwere grasping the arms of her chair, and I saw that\nthe pink nails had turned white with the pressure\nof her grip. \u201cHis wife!\u201d she said again. \u201cHis wife! He is not\na married man.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders. \u201cProve it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can\ndo so\u2014!\u201d The \ufb01erce \ufb02ash of her eyes said more\nthan any words. \u201cI have come prepared to do so,\u201d said Holmes,\ndrawing several papers from his pocket. \u201cHere is a\nphotograph of the couple taken in York four years\nago. It is indorsed \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,\u2019 but\nyou will have no dif\ufb01culty in recognizing him, and\nher also, if you know her by sight.

Why should I try to shield him from\nthe consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me\nwhat you like, and there is nothing which I shall\nhold back.

Even now we have no clear case\nagainst this very wily man.

Ah, well, I don\u2019t suppose you will forget\nyour \ufb01rst visit.\u201d\nCHAPTER XIV. The Hound of the Baskervilles\nOne of Sherlock Holmes\u2019s defects\u2014if, indeed,\none may call it a defect\u2014was that he was exceed-\ningly loath to communicate his full plans to any\nother person until the instant of their ful\ufb01lment. Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful na-\nture, which loved to dominate and surprise those\nwho were around him. Partly also from his profes-\nsional caution, which urged him never to take any\nchances. The result, however, was very trying for\nthose who were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered under it, but never more so\nthan during that long drive in the darkness. The\ngreat ordeal was in front of us; at last we were\nabout to make our \ufb01nal effort, and yet Holmes had\nsaid nothing, and I could only surmise what his\ncourse of action would be. My nerves thrilled with\nanticipation when at last the cold wind upon our\nfaces and the dark, void spaces on either side of\nthe narrow road told me that we were back upon\nthe moor once again. Every stride of the horses\nand every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer\nto our supreme adventure. Our conversation was hampered by the pres-\nence of the driver of the hired wagonette, so that\nwe were forced to talk of trivial matters when our\nnerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint,\nwhen we at last passed Frankland\u2019s house and\nknew that we were drawing near to the Hall and\nto the scene of action."

The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return\nto Coombe Tracey forthwith, while we started to\nwalk to Merripit House. \u201cAre you armed, Lestrade?\u201d\nThe little detective smiled. \u201cAs long as I have my trousers I have a hip-\npocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have\nsomething in it.\u201d\n\u201cGood! My friend and I are also ready for\nemergencies.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re mighty close about this affair, Mr.\nHolmes. What\u2019s the game now?\u201d\n\u201cA waiting game.\u201d\n\u201cMy word, it does not seem a very cheerful\nplace,\u201d said the detective with a shiver, glancing\nround him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at\nthe huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen\nMire. \u201cI see the lights of a house ahead of us.\u201d\n\u201cThat is Merripit House and the end of our\njourney. I must request you to walk on tiptoe and\nnot to talk above a whisper.\u201d\nWe moved cautiously along the track as if we\nwere bound for the house, but Holmes halted us\nwhen we were about two hundred yards from it. \u201cThis will do,\u201d said he. \u201cThese rocks upon the\nright make an admirable screen.\u201d\n\u201cWe are to wait here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get\ninto this hollow, Lestrade. You have been inside\nthe house, have you not, Watson? Can you tell\n649\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nthe position of the rooms? What are those latticed\nwindows at this end?\u201d\n\u201cI think they are the kitchen windows.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\nthe\none\nbeyond,\nwhich\nshines\nso\nbrightly?\u201d\n\u201cThat is certainly the dining-room.\u201d\n\u201cThe blinds are up.

Creep forward quietly and see what\nthey are doing\u2014but for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t let\nthem know that they are watched!\u201d\nI tiptoed down the path and stooped behind\nthe low wall which surrounded the stunted or-\nchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point\nwhence I could look straight through the uncur-\ntained window. There were only two men in the room, Sir\nHenry and Stapleton. They sat with their pro-\n\ufb01les towards me on either side of the round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and\nwine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking\nwith animation, but the baronet looked pale and\ndistrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk\nacross the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily\nupon his mind. As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the\nroom, while Sir Henry \ufb01lled his glass again and\nleaned back in his chair, puf\ufb01ng at his cigar. I\nheard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of\nboots upon gravel. The steps passed along the\npath on the other side of the wall under which I\ncrouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause\nat the door of an out-house in the corner of the or-\nchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed in\nthere was a curious scuf\ufb02ing noise from within."

It was drifting\nslowly in our direction, and banked itself up like a\nwall on that side of us, low, but thick and well\nde\ufb01ned. The moon shone on it, and it looked\nlike a great shimmering ice-\ufb01eld, with the heads\nof the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes\u2019s face was turned towards it, and he mut-\ntered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift. \u201cIt\u2019s moving towards us, Watson.\u201d\n\u201cIs that serious?\u201d\n\u201cVery serious, indeed\u2014the one thing upon\nearth which could have disarranged my plans. He\ncan\u2019t be very long, now. It is already ten o\u2019clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon\nhis coming out before the fog is over the path.\u201d\nThe night was clear and \ufb01ne above us. The stars\nshone cold and bright, while a half-moon bathed\nthe whole scene in a soft, uncertain light. Before\nus lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof\nand bristling chimneys hard outlined against the\nsilver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light\nfrom the lower windows stretched across the or-\nchard and the moor. One of them was suddenly\nshut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There\nonly remained the lamp in the dining-room where\nthe two men, the murderous host and the uncon-\nscious guest, still chatted over their cigars. Every minute that white woolly plain which\ncovered one half of the moor was drifting closer\nand closer to the house. Already the \ufb01rst thin\nwisps of it were curling across the golden square\nof the lighted window. The farther wall of the or-\nchard was already invisible, and the trees were\nstanding out of a swirl of white vapour. As we\nwatched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round\nboth corners of the house and rolled slowly into\none dense bank, on which the upper \ufb02oor and the\nroof \ufb02oated like a strange ship upon a shadowy\nsea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon\nthe rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his\nimpatience. \u201cIf he isn\u2019t out in a quarter of an hour the path\nwill be covered. In half an hour we won\u2019t be able\nto see our hands in front of us.\u201d\n\u201cShall we move farther back upon higher\nground?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I think it would be as well.\u201d\nSo as the fog-bank \ufb02owed onward we fell back\nbefore it until we were half a mile from the house,\nand still that dense white sea, with the moon\nsilvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inex-\norably on."

Crouching among the stones we stared in-\ntently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us. The\nsteps grew louder, and through the fog, as through\na curtain, there stepped the man whom we were\nawaiting. He looked round him in surprise as\nhe emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he\ncame swiftly along the path, passed close to where\nwe lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. As he walked he glanced continually over either\nshoulder, like a man who is ill at ease. \u201cHist!\u201d cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp\nclick of a cocking pistol. \u201cLook out! It\u2019s coming!\u201d\nThere was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from\nsomewhere in the heart of that crawling bank. The\ncloud was within \ufb01fty yards of where we lay, and\nwe glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror\nwas about to break from the heart of it. I was\nat Holmes\u2019s elbow, and I glanced for an instant\nat his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes\nshining brightly in the moonlight. But suddenly\nthey started forward in a rigid, \ufb01xed stare, and\nhis lips parted in amazement. At the same in-\nstant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw him-\nself face downward upon the ground. I sprang\nto my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my\nmind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had\nsprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound,\nbut not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever\nseen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes\nglowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and\nhackles and dewlap were outlined in \ufb02ickering\n\ufb02ame. Never in the delirious dream of a disor-\ndered brain could anything more savage, more ap-\npalling, more hellish be conceived than that dark\nform and savage face which broke upon us out of\nthe wall of fog. With long bounds the huge black creature was\nleaping down the track, following hard upon the\nfootsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we by\nthe apparition that we allowed him to pass be-\nfore we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes\nand I both \ufb01red together, and the creature gave a\nhideous howl, which showed that one at least had\nhit him. He did not pause, however, but bounded\nonward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry\nlooking back, his face white in the moonlight, his\nhands raised in horror, glaring helplessly at the\nfrightful thing which was hunting him down. But that cry of pain from the hound had blown\nall our fears to the winds."

In front of us as we \ufb02ew up the track\nwe heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and\nthe deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see\nthe beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the\nground, and worry at his throat. But the next in-\nstant Holmes had emptied \ufb01ve barrels of his re-\nvolver into the creature\u2019s \ufb02ank. With a last howl of\nagony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon\nits back, four feet pawing furiously, and then fell\nlimp upon its side. I stooped, panting, and pressed\nmy pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it\nwas useless to press the trigger. The giant hound\nwas dead. Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his collar, and Holmes breathed a\nprayer of gratitude when we saw that there was\nno sign of a wound and that the rescue had been\nin time. Already our friend\u2019s eyelids shivered and\nhe made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade thrust\nhis brandy-\ufb02ask between the baronet\u2019s teeth, and\ntwo frightened eyes were looking up at us. \u201cMy God!\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat was it?

It was\nnot a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mas-\ntiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the\ntwo\u2014gaunt, savage, and as large as a small li-\noness. Even now, in the stillness of death, the huge\njaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish \ufb02ame\nand the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed\nwith \ufb01re.

We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for\nhaving exposed you to this fright. I was prepared\nfor a hound, but not for such a creature as this. And the fog gave us little time to receive him.\u201d\n\u201cYou have saved my life.\u201d\n\u201cHaving \ufb01rst endangered it.

On the up-\nper \ufb02oor, however, one of the bedroom doors was\nlocked. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in here,\u201d cried Lestrade. \u201cI\ncan hear a movement. Open this door!\u201d\nA faint moaning and rustling came from\nwithin. Holmes struck the door just over the lock\nwith the \ufb02at of his foot and it \ufb02ew open. Pistol in\nhand, we all three rushed into the room. But there was no sign within it of that desper-\nate and de\ufb01ant villain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange and\nso unexpected that we stood for a moment staring\nat it in amazement. The room had been fashioned into a small mu-\nseum, and the walls were lined by a number of\nglass-topped cases full of that collection of butter-\n\ufb02ies and moths the formation of which had been\nthe relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In the centre of this room there was an upright\nbeam, which had been placed at some period as\na support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber\nwhich spanned the roof. To this post a \ufb01gure was\ntied, so swathed and muf\ufb02ed in the sheets which\nhad been used to secure it that one could not for\nthe moment tell whether it was that of a man or\na woman. One towel passed round the throat and\nwas secured at the back of the pillar. Another cov-\nered the lower part of the face, and over it two dark\neyes\u2014eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful\nquestioning\u2014stared back at us. In a minute we\nhad torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and\nMrs. Stapleton sank upon the \ufb02oor in front of us. As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the\nclear red weal of a whiplash across her neck. \u201cThe brute!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cHere, Lestrade,\nyour brandy-bottle!"

It\nhelped us to realize the horror of this woman\u2019s life\nwhen we saw the eagerness and joy with which\nshe laid us on her husband\u2019s track. We left her\nstanding upon the thin peninsula of \ufb01rm, peaty\nsoil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the end of it a small wand planted here and\nthere showed where the path zigzagged from tuft\nto tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits\nand foul quagmires which barred the way to the\nstranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants\nsent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic\nvapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged\nus more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quiv-\nering mire, which shook for yards in soft undula-\ntions around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked\nat our heels as we walked, and when we sank into\nit it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us\ndown into those obscene depths, so grim and pur-\nposeful was the clutch in which it held us. Once\nonly we saw a trace that someone had passed that\nperilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton\ngrass which bore it up out of the slime some dark\nthing was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist\nas he stepped from the path to seize it, and had\nwe not been there to drag him out he could never\nhave set his foot upon \ufb01rm land again. He held an\nold black boot in the air. \u201cMeyers, Toronto,\u201d was\nprinted on the leather inside. \u201cIt is worth a mud bath,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is our\nfriend Sir Henry\u2019s missing boot.\u201d\n\u201cThrown there by Stapleton in his \ufb02ight.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. He retained it in his hand after using\nit to set the hound upon the track. He \ufb02ed when\nhe knew the game was up, still clutching it. And\nhe hurled it away at this point of his \ufb02ight. We\nknow at least that he came so far in safety.\u201d\nBut more than that we were never destined to\nknow, though there was much which we might\nsurmise. There was no chance of \ufb01nding foot-\nsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly\nin upon them, but as we at last reached \ufb01rmer\nground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly\nfor them. But no slightest sign of them ever met\nour eyes. If the earth told a true story, then Sta-\npleton never reached that island of refuge towards\nwhich he struggled through the fog upon that\nlast night. Somewhere in the heart of the great\nGrimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge\nmorass which had sucked him in, this cold and\ncruel-hearted man is forever buried. Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt\nisland where he had hid his savage ally."

Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire\nhe had been engaged in two affairs of the ut-\nmost importance, in the \ufb01rst of which he had ex-\nposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood\nin connection with the famous card scandal of the\nNonpareil Club, while in the second he had de-\nfended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from\nthe charge of murder which hung over her in con-\nnection with the death of her step-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be remem-\nbered, was found six months later alive and mar-\nried in New York. My friend was in excellent spir-\nits over the success which had attended a succes-\nsion of dif\ufb01cult and important cases, so that I was\nable to induce him to discuss the details of the\nBaskerville mystery."

Sir\nHenry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in Lon-\ndon, on their way to that long voyage which had\nbeen recommended for the restoration of his shat-\ntered nerves. They had called upon us that very\nafternoon, so that it was natural that the subject\nshould come up for discussion. \u201cThe whole course of events,\u201d said Holmes,\n\u201cfrom the point of view of the man who called\nhimself Stapleton was simple and direct, although\nto us, who had no means in the beginning of\nknowing the motives of his actions and could only\nlearn part of the facts, it all appeared exceedingly\ncomplex. I have had the advantage of two conver-\nsations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case has now\nbeen so entirely cleared up that I am not aware\nthat there is anything which has remained a secret\nto us. You will \ufb01nd a few notes upon the matter\nunder the heading B in my indexed list of cases.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of\nthe course of events from memory.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, though I cannot guarantee that I\ncarry all the facts in my mind. Intense mental\nconcentration has a curious way of blotting out\nwhat has passed. The barrister who has his case\nat his \ufb01ngers\u2019 ends, and is able to argue with an\nexpert upon his own subject \ufb01nds that a week or\ntwo of the courts will drive it all out of his head\nonce more. So each of my cases displaces the\nlast, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my recollection\nof Baskerville Hall. To-morrow some other little\nproblem may be submitted to my notice which will\nin turn dispossess the fair French lady and the in-\nfamous Upwood. So far as the case of the Hound\ngoes, however, I will give you the course of events\nas nearly as I can, and you will suggest anything\nwhich I may have forgotten. \u201cMy inquiries show beyond all question that\nthe family portrait did not lie, and that this fel-\nlow was indeed a Baskerville. He was a son of\nthat Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of\nSir Charles, who \ufb02ed with a sinister reputation to\nSouth America, where he was said to have died\nunmarried. He did, as a matter of fact, marry,\nand had one child, this fellow, whose real name\nis the same as his father\u2019s. He married Beryl Gar-\ncia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having\npurloined a considerable sum of public money, he\nchanged his name to Vandeleur and \ufb02ed to Eng-\nland, where he established a school in the east\nof Yorkshire. His reason for attempting this spe-\ncial line of business was that he had struck up\nan acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon\nthe voyage home, and that he had used this man\u2019s\nability to make the undertaking a success."

The\n654\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nVandeleurs found it convenient to change their\nname to Stapleton, and he brought the remains\nof his fortune, his schemes for the future, and his\ntaste for entomology to the south of England. I\nlearned at the British Museum that he was a rec-\nognized authority upon the subject, and that the\nname of Vandeleur has been permanently attached\nto a certain moth which he had, in his Yorkshire\ndays, been the \ufb01rst to describe. \u201cWe now come to that portion of his life which\nhas proved to be of such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found\nthat only two lives intervened between him and a\nvaluable estate. When he went to Devonshire his\nplans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but that\nhe meant mischief from the \ufb01rst is evident from\nthe way in which he took his wife with him in the\ncharacter of his sister. The idea of using her as a\ndecoy was clearly already in his mind, though he\nmay not have been certain how the details of his\nplot were to be arranged. He meant in the end to\nhave the estate, and he was ready to use any tool\nor run any risk for that end. His \ufb01rst act was to es-\ntablish himself as near to his ancestral home as he\ncould, and his second was to cultivate a friendship\nwith Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neigh-\nbours. \u201cThe baronet himself told him about the family\nhound, and so prepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue to call him, knew that\nthe old man\u2019s heart was weak and that a shock\nwould kill him. So much he had learned from\nDr. Mortimer. He had heard also that Sir Charles\nwas superstitious and had taken this grim legend\nvery seriously. His ingenious mind instantly sug-\ngested a way by which the baronet could be done\nto death, and yet it would be hardly possible to\nbring home the guilt to the real murderer. \u201cHaving conceived the idea he proceeded to\ncarry it out with considerable \ufb01nesse. An ordinary\nschemer would have been content to work with a\nsavage hound. The use of arti\ufb01cial means to make\nthe creature diabolical was a \ufb02ash of genius upon\nhis part. The dog he bought in London from Ross\nand Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It was\nthe strongest and most savage in their possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and\nwalked a great distance over the moor so as to get\nit home without exciting any remarks. He had al-\nready on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the\nGrimpen Mire, and so had found a safe hiding-\nplace for the creature. Here he kennelled it and\nwaited his chance. \u201cBut it was some time coming."

It was during these\nfruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen\nby peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog\nreceived a new con\ufb01rmation. He had hoped that\nhis wife might lure Sir Charles to his ruin, but here\nshe proved unexpectedly independent. She would\nnot endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a\nsentimental attachment which might deliver him\nover to his enemy. Threats and even, I am sorry\nto say, blows refused to move her. She would have\nnothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was\nat a deadlock. \u201cHe found a way out of his dif\ufb01culties through\nthe chance that Sir Charles, who had conceived a\nfriendship for him, made him the minister of his\ncharity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs.\nLaura Lyons. By representing himself as a single\nman he acquired complete in\ufb02uence over her, and\nhe gave her to understand that in the event of her\nobtaining a divorce from her husband he would\nmarry her. His plans were suddenly brought to a\nhead by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about\nto leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer,\nwith whose opinion he himself pretended to coin-\ncide. He must act at once, or his victim might get\nbeyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon\nMrs. Lyons to write this letter, imploring the old\nman to give her an interview on the evening before\nhis departure for London. He then, by a specious\nargument, prevented her from going, and so had\nthe chance for which he had waited. \u201cDriving back in the evening from Coombe\nTracey he was in time to get his hound, to treat\nit with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast\nround to the gate at which he had reason to ex-\npect that he would \ufb01nd the old gentleman wait-\ning. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over the\nwicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet,\nwho \ufb02ed screaming down the Yew Alley. In that\ngloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dread-\nful sight to see that huge black creature, with its\n\ufb02aming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding after its\nvictim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from\nheart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon\nthe grassy border while the baronet had run down\nthe path, so that no track but the man\u2019s was vis-\nible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\nprobably approached to sniff at him, but \ufb01nding\nhim dead had turned away again. It was then\nthat it left the print which was actually observed\nby Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and\nhurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and\na mystery was left which puzzled the authorities,\n655\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\nalarmed the country-side, and \ufb01nally brought the\ncase within the scope of our observation."

You perceive the devilish cunning of\nit, for really it would be almost impossible to make\na case against the real murderer. His only accom-\nplice was one who could never give him away, and\nthe grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device\nonly served to make it more effective. Both of the\nwomen concerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and\nMrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspi-\ncion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that\nhe had designs upon the old man, and also of the\nexistence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons knew neither\nof these things, but had been impressed by the\ndeath occurring at the time of an uncancelled ap-\npointment which was only known to him. How-\never, both of them were under his in\ufb02uence, and\nhe had nothing to fear from them. The \ufb01rst half\nof his task was successfully accomplished but the\nmore dif\ufb01cult still remained. \u201cIt is possible that Stapleton did not know of\nthe existence of an heir in Canada. In any case\nhe would very soon learn it from his friend Dr.\nMortimer, and he was told by the latter all de-\ntails about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Staple-\nton\u2019s \ufb01rst idea was that this young stranger from\nCanada might possibly be done to death in Lon-\ndon without coming down to Devonshire at all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused\nto help him in laying a trap for the old man, and\nhe dared not leave her long out of his sight for\nfear he should lose his in\ufb02uence over her. It was\nfor this reason that he took her to London with\nhim. They lodged, I \ufb01nd, at the Mexborough Pri-\nvate Hotel, in Craven Street, which was actually\none of those called upon by my agent in search\nof evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned\nin her room while he, disguised in a beard, fol-\nlowed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and afterwards\nto the station and to the Northumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but she\nhad such a fear of her husband\u2014a fear founded\nupon brutal ill-treatment\u2014that she dare not write\nto warn the man whom she knew to be in dan-\nger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton\u2019s hands\nher own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we\nknow, she adopted the expedient of cutting out\nthe words which would form the message, and ad-\ndressing the letter in a disguised hand. It reached\nthe baronet, and gave him the \ufb01rst warning of his\ndanger. \u201cIt was very essential for Stapleton to get some\narticle of Sir Henry\u2019s attire so that, in case he was\ndriven to use the dog, he might always have the\nmeans of setting him upon his track. With char-\nacteristic promptness and audacity he set about\nthis at once, and we cannot doubt that the boots or\nchamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help\nhim in his design."

He then\nhad it returned and obtained another\u2014a most in-\nstructive incident, since it proved conclusively to\nmy mind that we were dealing with a real hound,\nas no other supposition could explain this anxiety\nto obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new\none. The more outr\u00b4e and grotesque an incident is\nthe more carefully it deserves to be examined, and\nthe very point which appears to complicate a case\nis, when duly considered and scienti\ufb01cally han-\ndled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it. \u201cThen we had the visit from our friends next\nmorning, shadowed always by Stapleton in the\ncab. From his knowledge of our rooms and of my\nappearance, as well as from his general conduct,\nI am inclined to think that Stapleton\u2019s career of\ncrime has been by no means limited to this single\nBaskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the\nlast three years there have been four considerable\nburglaries in the West Country, for none of which\nwas any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at\nFolkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the\ncold-blooded pistoling of the page, who surprised\nthe masked and solitary burglar. I cannot doubt\nthat Stapleton recruited his waning resources in\nthis fashion, and that for years he has been a des-\nperate and dangerous man. \u201cWe had an example of his readiness of re-\nsource that morning when he got away from us\nso successfully, and also of his audacity in sending\nback my own name to me through the cabman. From that moment he understood that I had taken\nover the case in London, and that therefore there\nwas no chance for him there. He returned to Dart-\nmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment!\u201d said I. \u201cYou have, no doubt,\ndescribed the sequence of events correctly, but\nthere is one point which you have left unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in\nLondon?\u201d\n\u201cI have given some attention to this matter and\nit is undoubtedly of importance. There can be no\nquestion that Stapleton had a con\ufb01dant, though it\nis unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power\nby sharing all his plans with him. There was an\nold manservant at Merripit House, whose name\nwas Anthony. His connection with the Stapletons\n656\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\ncan be traced for several years, as far back as the\nschoolmastering days, so that he must have been\naware that his master and mistress were really hus-\nband and wife. This man has disappeared and has\nescaped from the country. It is suggestive that An-\nthony is not a common name in England, while\nAntonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American\ncountries. The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself,\nspoke good English, but with a curious lisping ac-\ncent. I have myself seen this old man cross the\nGrimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had\nmarked out."

One word now as to how I stood\nmyself at that time. It may possibly recur to your\nmemory that when I examined the paper upon\nwhich the printed words were fastened I made a\nclose inspection for the water-mark. In doing so\nI held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was\nconscious of a faint smell of the scent known as\nwhite jessamine.

My hardships were not so great\nas you imagined, though such tri\ufb02ing details must\nnever interfere with the investigation of a case. I\nstayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and\nonly used the hut upon the moor when it was nec-\nessary to be near the scene of action. Cartwright\nhad come down with me, and in his disguise as\na country boy he was of great assistance to me. I\nwas dependent upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton, Cartwright was\nfrequently watching you, so that I was able to keep\nmy hand upon all the strings. \u201cI have already told you that your reports\nreached me rapidly, being forwarded instantly\nfrom Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were\nof great service to me, and especially that one in-\ncidentally truthful piece of biography of Staple-\nton\u2019s. I was able to establish the identity of the\nman and the woman and knew at last exactly how\nI stood. The case had been considerably com-\nplicated through the incident of the escaped con-\nvict and the relations between him and the Barry-\nmores. This also you cleared up in a very effective\nway, though I had already come to the same con-\nclusions from my own observations. \u201cBy the time that you discovered me upon the\nmoor I had a complete knowledge of the whole\nbusiness, but I had not a case which could go to\na jury. Even Stapleton\u2019s attempt upon Sir Henry\nthat night which ended in the death of the unfor-\ntunate convict did not help us much in proving\nmurder against our man."

We did so, and at the\ncost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded\nin completing our case and driving Stapleton to\nhis destruction. That Sir Henry should have been\nexposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to\nmy management of the case, but we had no means\nof foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle\nwhich the beast presented, nor could we predict\nthe fog which enabled him to burst upon us at\nsuch short notice. We succeeded in our object at\na cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer\nassure me will be a temporary one. A long journey\nmay enable our friend to recover not only from his\nshattered nerves but also from his wounded feel-\nings. His love for the lady was deep and sincere,\nand to him the saddest part of all this black busi-\nness was that he should have been deceived by her. \u201cIt only remains to indicate the part which\nshe had played throughout. There can be no\ndoubt that Stapleton exercised an in\ufb02uence over\nher which may have been love or may have been\nfear, or very possibly both, since they are by no\nmeans incompatible emotions. It was, at least, ab-\nsolutely effective. At his command she consented\nto pass as his sister, though he found the limits of\nhis power over her when he endeavoured to make\nher the direct accessory to murder. She was ready\nto warn Sir Henry so far as she could without im-\nplicating her husband, and again and again she\ntried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have\nbeen capable of jealousy, and when he saw the\nbaronet paying court to the lady, even though it\nwas part of his own plan, still he could not help\ninterrupting with a passionate outburst which re-\nvealed the \ufb01ery soul which his self-contained man-\nner so cleverly concealed. By encouraging the in-\n657\ntimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would\nfrequently come to Merripit House and that he\nwould sooner or later get the opportunity which\nhe desired. On the day of the crisis, however,\nhis wife turned suddenly against him. She had\nlearned something of the death of the convict, and\nshe knew that the hound was being kept in the out-\nhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to\ndinner. She taxed her husband with his intended\ncrime, and a furious scene followed, in which he\nshowed her for the \ufb01rst time that she had a ri-\nval in his love. Her \ufb01delity turned in an instant\nto bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray\nhim. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have\nno chance of warning Sir Henry, and he hoped,\nno doubt, that when the whole country-side put\ndown the baronet\u2019s death to the curse of his family,\nas they certainly would do, he could win his wife\nback to accept an accomplished fact and to keep\nsilent upon what she knew."

A woman of Spanish blood does\nnot condone such an injury so lightly. And now,\nmy dear Watson, without referring to my notes, I\ncannot give you a more detailed account of this cu-\nrious case. I do not know that anything essential\nhas been left unexplained.\u201d\n\u201cHe could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to\ndeath as he had done the old uncle with his bogie\nhound.\u201d\n\u201cThe beast was savage and half-starved. If its\nappearance did not frighten its victim to death, at\nleast it would paralyze the resistance which might\nbe offered.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt. There only remains one dif\ufb01culty. If Stapleton came into the succession, how could\nhe explain the fact that he, the heir, had been liv-\ning unannounced under another name so close to\nthe property? How could he claim it without caus-\ning suspicion and inquiry?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a formidable dif\ufb01culty, and I fear that you\nask too much when you expect me to solve it. The\npast and the present are within the \ufb01eld of my in-\nquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a\nhard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard\nher husband discuss the problem on several occa-\nsions. There were three possible courses. He might\nclaim the property from South America, establish\nhis identity before the British authorities there and\nso obtain the fortune without ever coming to Eng-\nland at all; or he might adopt an elaborate disguise\nduring the short time that he need be in London;\nor, again, he might furnish an accomplice with the\nproofs and papers, putting him in as heir, and re-\ntaining a claim upon some proportion of his in-\ncome. We cannot doubt from what we know of\nhim that he would have found some way out of the\ndif\ufb01culty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had\nsome weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I\nthink, we may turn our thoughts into more pleas-\nant channels. I have a box for \u2018Les Huguenots.\u2019\nHave you heard the De Reszkes?

The Tragedy of Birlstone\nThe Valley Of Fear\nCHAPTER I. The Warning\nI\nam inclined to think\u2014\u201d said I. \u201cI should do so,\u201d Sherlock Holmes\nremarked impatiently. I believe that I am one of the most\nlong-suffering of mortals; but I\u2019ll admit that I was\nannoyed at the sardonic interruption. \u201cReally, Holmes,\u201d said I severely, \u201cyou are a lit-\ntle trying at times.\u201d\nHe was too much absorbed with his own\nthoughts to give any immediate answer to my re-\nmonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his\nuntasted breakfast before him, and he stared at the\nslip of paper which he had just drawn from its en-\nvelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it\nup to the light, and very carefully studied both the\nexterior and the \ufb02ap. \u201cIt is Porlock\u2019s writing,\u201d said he thoughtfully. \u201cI can hardly doubt that it is Porlock\u2019s writing,\nthough I have seen it only twice before. The Greek\ne with the peculiar top \ufb02ourish is distinctive. But if\nit is Porlock, then it must be something of the very\n\ufb01rst importance.\u201d\nHe was speaking to himself rather than to me;\nbut my vexation disappeared in the interest which\nthe words awakened. \u201cWho then is Porlock?\u201d I asked. \u201cPorlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere\nidenti\ufb01cation mark; but behind it lies a shifty and\nevasive personality. In a former letter he frankly\ninformed me that the name was not his own, and\nde\ufb01ed me ever to trace him among the teeming\nmillions of this great city."

That is where\nhe comes within my purview. You have heard me\nspeak of Professor Moriarty?\u201d\n\u201cThe famous scienti\ufb01c criminal, as famous\namong crooks as\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy blushes, Watson!\u201d Holmes murmured in a\ndeprecating voice. \u201cI was about to say, as he is unknown to the\npublic.\u201d\n\u201cA touch! A distinct touch!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cYou are developing a certain unexpected vein\nof pawky humour, Watson, against which I must\nlearn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a\ncriminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the\nlaw\u2014and there lie the glory and the wonder of\nit! The greatest schemer of all time, the orga-\nnizer of every deviltry, the controlling brain of the\nunderworld, a brain which might have made or\nmarred the destiny of nations\u2014that\u2019s the man! But\nso aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune\nfrom criticism, so admirable in his management\nand self-effacement, that for those very words that\nyou have uttered he could hale you to a court and\nemerge with your year\u2019s pension as a solatium for\nhis wounded character. Is he not the celebrated au-\nthor of The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a book which\nascends to such rare\ufb01ed heights of pure mathe-\nmatics that it is said that there was no man in the\nscienti\ufb01c press capable of criticizing it? Is this a\nman to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slan-\ndered professor\u2014such would be your respective\nroles! That\u2019s genius, Watson. But if I am spared by\nlesser men, our day will surely come.\u201d\n\u201cMay I be there to see!\u201d I exclaimed devoutly. \u201cBut you were speaking of this man Porlock.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes\u2014the so-called Porlock is a link in the\nchain some little way from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link\u2014between our-\nselves. He is the only \ufb02aw in that chain so far as I\nhave been able to test it.\u201d\n\u201cBut no chain is stronger than its weakest link.\u201d\n\u201cExactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme\nimportance of Porlock. Led on by some rudi-\nmentary aspirations towards right, and encour-\naged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional\nten-pound note sent to him by devious meth-\nods, he has once or twice given me advance in-\nformation which has been of value\u2014that highest\nvalue which anticipates and prevents rather than\navenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the\ncipher, we should \ufb01nd that this communication is\nof the nature that I indicate.\u201d\nAgain Holmes \ufb02attened out the paper upon his\nunused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, stared\ndown at the curious inscription, which ran as fol-\nlows:\n534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41\nDOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE\n26 BIRLSTONE 9 47 171\n665\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cWhat do you make of it, Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cIt is obviously an attempt to convey secret in-\nformation.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is the use of a cipher message with-\nout the cipher?\u201d\n\u201cIn this instance, none at all.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you say \u2018in this instance\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cBecause there are many ciphers which I would\nread as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony\ncolumn: such crude devices amuse the intelligence\nwithout fatiguing it."

Our sec-\nond post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised\nif it does not bring us either a further letter of ex-\nplanation, or, as is more probable, the very volume\nto which these \ufb01gures refer.\u201d\nHolmes\u2019s calculation was ful\ufb01lled within a very\nfew minutes by the appearance of Billy, the page,\nwith the very letter which we were expecting. \u201cThe same writing,\u201d remarked Holmes, as he\nopened the envelope, \u201cand actually signed,\u201d he\nadded in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epis-\ntle. \u201cCome, we are getting on, Watson.\u201d His brow\nclouded, however, as he glanced over the contents. \u201cDear me, this is very disappointing!

It is too dangerous\u2014he suspects me. I\ncan see that he suspects me. He came\nto me quite unexpectedly after I had ac-\ntually addressed this envelope with the\nintention of sending you the key to the\ncipher. I was able to cover it up.

It may be only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may have read\nthe accusation in the other\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\u201cThe other being, I presume, Professor Mori-\narty.\u201d\n\u201cNo less!

That\u2019s a large question. When you have\none of the \ufb01rst brains of Europe up against you,\nand all the powers of darkness at his back, there\nare in\ufb01nite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock\nis evidently scared out of his senses\u2014kindly com-\npare the writing in the note to that upon its en-\nvelope; which was done, he tells us, before this\nill-omened visit.

That is our point of depar-\nture.\u201d\n\u201cA somewhat vague one.\u201d\n\u201cLet us see then if we can narrow it down. As\nI focus my mind upon it, it seems rather less im-\npenetrable. What indications have we as to this\nbook?\u201d\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher message begins with a large 534, does\nit not?

So now, you see, we begin to visual-\nize a large book printed in double columns which\nare each of a considerable length, since one of the\nwords is numbered in the document as the two\nhundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the\nlimits of what reason can supply?\u201d\n\u201cI fear that we have.\u201d\n\u201cSurely you do yourself an injustice. One more\ncoruscation, my dear Watson\u2014yet another brain-\nwave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he\nwould have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had\nintended, before his plans were nipped, to send\nme the clue in this envelope. He says so in his\nnote. This would seem to indicate that the book is\none which he thought I would have no dif\ufb01culty\nin \ufb01nding for myself. He had it\u2014and he imagined\nthat I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a\nvery common book.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you say certainly sounds plausible.\u201d\n\u201cSo we have contracted our \ufb01eld of search to a\nlarge book, printed in double columns and in com-\nmon use.\u201d\n\u201cThe Bible!\u201d I cried triumphantly."

You are bound to leave something to\nthe intelligence of your correspondent. The pur-\nport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended\nagainst one Douglas, whoever he may be, resid-\ning as stated, a rich country gentleman. He is\nsure\u2014\u2018con\ufb01dence\u2019 was as near as he could get to\n\u2018con\ufb01dent\u2019\u2014that it is pressing. There is our re-\nsult\u2014and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis\nit was!\u201d\nHolmes had the impersonal joy of the true\nartist in his better work, even as he mourned\ndarkly when it fell below the high level to which\nhe aspired. He was still chuckling over his suc-\ncess when Billy swung open the door and Inspec-\ntor MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into\nthe room. Those were the early days at the end of the\n\u201980\u2019s, when Alec MacDonald was far from hav-\ning attained the national fame which he has now\nachieved. He was a young but trusted member\nof the detective force, who had distinguished him-\nself in several cases which had been entrusted to\nhim. His tall, bony \ufb01gure gave promise of excep-\ntional physical strength, while his great cranium\nand deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of\nthe keen intelligence which twinkled out from be-\nhind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise\nman with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian\naccent. Twice already in his career had Holmes helped\nhim to attain success, his own sole reward being\nthe intellectual joy of the problem. For this reason\nthe affection and respect of the Scotchman for his\namateur colleague were profound, and he showed\nthem by the frankness with which he consulted\nHolmes in every dif\ufb01culty. Mediocrity knows\nnothing higher than itself; but talent instantly rec-\nognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent enough\nfor his profession to enable him to perceive that\nthere was no humiliation in seeking the assistance\nof one who already stood alone in Europe, both in\nhis gifts and in his experience. Holmes was not\nprone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big\nScotchman, and smiled at the sight of him. \u201cYou are an early bird, Mr. Mac,\u201d said he. \u201cI\nwish you luck with your worm. I fear this means\nthat there is some mischief afoot.\u201d\n\u201cIf you said \u2018hope\u2019 instead of \u2018fear,\u2019 it would be\nnearer the truth, I\u2019m thinking, Mr. Holmes,\u201d the\ninspector answered, with a knowing grin."

But\u2014but\u2014\u201d\nThe inspector had stopped suddenly, and was\nstaring with a look of absolute amazement at a pa-\nper upon the table. It was the sheet upon which I\nhad scrawled the enigmatic message. \u201cDouglas!\u201d he stammered. \u201cBirlstone! What\u2019s\nthis, Mr. Holmes? Man, it\u2019s witchcraft! Where in\nthe name of all that is wonderful did you get those\nnames?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had\noccasion to solve.

Sherlock Holmes Discourses\nIt was one of those dramatic moments for\nwhich my friend existed. It would be an overstate-\nment to say that he was shocked or even excited\nby the amazing announcement. Without having a\ntinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was\nundoubtedly callous from long over-stimulation. 668\nThe Valley Of Fear\nYet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual\nperceptions were exceedingly active. There was\nno trace then of the horror which I had myself felt\nat this curt declaration; but his face showed rather\nthe quiet and interested composure of the chemist\nwho sees the crystals falling into position from his\noversaturated solution. \u201cRemarkable!\u201d said he. \u201cRemarkable!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised.\u201d\n\u201cInterested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised? I receive an anony-\nmous communication from a quarter which I know\nto be important, warning me that danger threatens\na certain person. Within an hour I learn that this\ndanger has actually materialized and that the per-\nson is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I\nam not surprised.\u201d\nIn a few short sentences he explained to the in-\nspector the facts about the letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and his\ngreat sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tan-\ngle. \u201cI was going down to Birlstone this morning,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cI had come to ask you if you cared to\ncome with me\u2014you and your friend here. But\nfrom what you say we might perhaps be doing bet-\nter work in London.\u201d\n\u201cI rather think not,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHang it all, Mr. Holmes!\u201d cried the inspector. \u201cThe papers will be full of the Birlstone mystery in\na day or two; but where\u2019s the mystery if there is a\nman in London who prophesied the crime before\never it occurred? We have only to lay our hands\non that man, and the rest will follow.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose\nto lay your hands on the so-called Porlock?\u201d\nMacDonald\nturned\nover\nthe\nletter\nwhich\nHolmes had handed him."

Yes, I saw the picture\u2014a\nyoung woman with her head on her hands, peep-\ning at you sideways.\u201d\n\u201cThat painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.\u201d\nThe inspector endeavoured to look interested. \u201cJean Baptiste Greuze,\u201d Holmes continued,\njoining his \ufb01nger tips and leaning well back in his\nchair, \u201cwas a French artist who \ufb02ourished between\nthe years 1750 and 1800.

In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre\nof it.\u201d\nMacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appeal-\ningly to me. \u201cYour thoughts move a bit too quick\nfor me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two,\nand I can\u2019t get over the gap. What in the whole\nwide world can be the connection between this\ndead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?\u201d\n\u201cAll knowledge comes useful to the detective,\u201d\nremarked Holmes. \u201cEven the trivial fact that in\nthe year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled La Je-\nune Fille a l\u2019Agneau fetched one million two hun-\ndred thousand francs\u2014more than forty thousand\npounds\u2014at the Portalis sale may start a train of\nre\ufb02ection in your mind.\u201d\nIt was clear that it did.

But about this\npicture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes,\nthat you had never met Professor Moriarty.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I never have.\u201d\n\u201cThen how do you know about his rooms?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s another matter. I have been three\ntimes in his rooms, twice waiting for him un-\nder different pretexts and leaving before he came. Once\u2014well, I can hardly tell about the once to an\nof\ufb01cial detective. It was on the last occasion that I\ntook the liberty of running over his papers\u2014with\nthe most unexpected results.\u201d\n\u201cYou found something compromising?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing. That was what amazed\nme. However, you have now seen the point of the\npicture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man. How did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His\nyounger brother is a station master in the west of\nEngland. His chair is worth seven hundred a year. And he owns a Greuze.\u201d\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cSurely the inference is plain.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that he has a great income and that\nhe must earn it in an illegal fashion?\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Of course I have other reasons for\nthinking so\u2014dozens of exiguous threads which\nlead vaguely up towards the centre of the web\nwhere the poisonous, motionless creature is lurk-\ning. I only mention the Greuze because it brings\nthe matter within the range of your own observa-\ntion.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say\nis interesting: it\u2019s more than interesting\u2014it\u2019s just\nwonderful.

Some-\none in a novel, was he not? I don\u2019t take much\nstock of detectives in novels\u2014chaps that do things\nand never let you see how they do them. That\u2019s\njust inspiration: not business.\u201d\n\u201cJonathan Wild wasn\u2019t a detective, and he\nwasn\u2019t in a novel.

I\u2019m a practical man.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever\ndid in your life would be to shut yourself up for\nthree months and read twelve hours a day at the\nannals of crime. Everything comes in circles\u2014even\nProfessor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden\nforce of the London criminals, to whom he sold his\nbrains and his organization on a \ufb01fteen per cent\ncommission. The old wheel turns, and the same\nspoke comes up. It\u2019s all been done before, and\nwill be again. I\u2019ll tell you one or two things about\nMoriarty which may interest you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll interest me, right enough.\u201d\n\u201cI happen to know who is the \ufb01rst link in his\nchain\u2014a chain with this Napoleon-gone-wrong at\none end, and a hundred broken \ufb01ghting men, pick-\npockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the\nother, with every sort of crime in between.

That\u2019s paying for brains,\nyou see\u2014the American business principle. I\nlearned that detail quite by chance. It\u2019s more than\nthe Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea\nof Moriarty\u2019s gains and of the scale on which he\nworks. Another point: I made it my business to\nhunt down some of Moriarty\u2019s checks lately\u2014just\ncommon innocent checks that he pays his house-\nhold bills with. They were drawn on six different\nbanks. Does that make any impression on your\nmind?\u201d\n\u201cQueer, certainly! But what do you gather from\nit?\u201d\n\u201cThat he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know what he had. I have\nno doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the\nbulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank\nor the Credit Lyonnais as likely as not. Sometime\nwhen you have a year or two to spare I commend\nto you the study of Professor Moriarty.\u201d\nInspector MacDonald had grown steadily more\nimpressed as the conversation proceeded. He had\nlost himself in his interest.

It is, as I gather from your orig-\ninal remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an unex-\nplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source\nof the crime is as we suspect it to be, there might be\ntwo different motives. In the \ufb01rst place, I may tell\nyou that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his\npeople. His discipline is tremendous. There is only\none punishment in his code. It is death. Now we\nmight suppose that this murdered man\u2014this Dou-\nglas whose approaching fate was known by one\nof the arch-criminal\u2019s subordinates\u2014had in some\nway betrayed the chief.

He brightened and rubbed\nhis thin hands together as he listened to the mea-\ngre but remarkable details. A long series of sterile\nweeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a\n\ufb01tting object for those remarkable powers which,\nlike all special gifts, become irksome to their owner\nwhen they are not in use. That razor brain blunted\nand rusted with inaction.

It is the centre for a considerable\narea of country, since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest\nplace of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the\neastward, over the borders of Kent. About half a mile from the town, standing in\nan old park famous for its huge beech trees, is the\nancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this ven-\nerable building dates back to the time of the \ufb01rst\ncrusade, when Hugo de Capus built a fortalice in\nthe centre of the estate, which had been granted to\nhim by the Red King. This was destroyed by \ufb01re\nin 1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner\nstones were used when, in Jacobean times, a brick\ncountry house rose upon the ruins of the feudal\ncastle. The Manor House, with its many gables and\nits small diamond-paned windows, was still much\nas the builder had left it in the early seventeenth\ncentury. Of the double moats which had guarded\nits more warlike predecessor, the outer had been\nallowed to dry up, and served the humble func-\ntion of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still\nthere, and lay forty feet in breadth, though now\nonly a few feet in depth, round the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it, so\nthat the sheet of water, though turbid, was never\nditch-like or unhealthy. The ground \ufb02oor windows\nwere within a foot of the surface of the water. The only approach to the house was over a\n672\nThe Valley Of Fear\ndrawbridge, the chains and windlass of which had\nlong been rusted and broken. The latest tenants\nof the Manor House had, however, with charac-\nteristic energy, set this right, and the drawbridge\nwas not only capable of being raised, but actually\nwas raised every evening and lowered every morn-\ning. By thus renewing the custom of the old feu-\ndal days the Manor House was converted into an\nisland during the night\u2014a fact which had a very\ndirect bearing upon the mystery which was soon\nto engage the attention of all England. The house had been untenanted for some years\nand was threatening to moulder into a picturesque\ndecay when the Douglases took possession of\nit. This family consisted of only two individu-\nals\u2014John Douglas and his wife. Douglas was a\nremarkable man, both in character and in person. In age he may have been about \ufb01fty, with a strong-\njawed, rugged face, a grizzling moustache, pecu-\nliarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous \ufb01gure\nwhich had lost nothing of the strength and activ-\nity of youth. He was cheery and genial to all, but\nsomewhat offhand in his manners, giving the im-\npression that he had seen life in social strata on\nsome far lower horizon than the county society of\nSussex."

He appeared to have plenty of money, which\nwas said to have been gained in the California gold\n\ufb01elds, and it was clear from his own talk and that\nof his wife that he had spent a part of his life in\nAmerica. The good impression which had been pro-\nduced by his generosity and by his democratic\nmanners was increased by a reputation gained for\nutter indifference to danger. Though a wretched\nrider, he turned out at every meet, and took the\nmost amazing falls in his determination to hold\nhis own with the best. When the vicarage caught\n\ufb01re he distinguished himself also by the fearless-\nness with which he reentered the building to save\nproperty, after the local \ufb01re brigade had given it\nup as impossible. Thus it came about that John\nDouglas of the Manor House had within \ufb01ve years\nwon himself quite a reputation in Birlstone. His wife, too, was popular with those who had\nmade her acquaintance; though, after the English\nfashion, the callers upon a stranger who settled in\nthe county without introductions were few and far\nbetween. This mattered the less to her, as she was\nretiring by disposition, and very much absorbed,\nto all appearance, in her husband and her domestic\nduties. It was known that she was an English lady\nwho had met Mr. Douglas in London, he being at\nthat time a widower. She was a beautiful woman,\ntall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger\nthan her husband, a disparity which seemed in no\nwise to mar the contentment of their family life. It was remarked sometimes, however, by those\nwho knew them best, that the con\ufb01dence between\nthe two did not appear to be complete, since the\nwife was either very reticent about her husband\u2019s\npast life, or else, as seemed more likely, was im-\nperfectly informed about it. It had also been noted\nand commented upon by a few observant people\nthat there were signs sometimes of some nerve-\nstrain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and that\nshe would display acute uneasiness if her absent\nhusband should ever be particularly late in his\nreturn. On a quiet countryside, where all gos-\nsip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the\nManor House did not pass without remark, and\nit bulked larger upon people\u2019s memory when the\nevents arose which gave it a very special signi\ufb01-\ncance. There was yet another individual whose resi-\ndence under that roof was, it is true, only an inter-\nmittent one, but whose presence at the time of the\nstrange happenings which will now be narrated\nbrought his name prominently before the pub-\nlic."

Cecil Barker\u2019s tall, loose-jointed \ufb01gure was a\nfamiliar one in the main street of Birlstone village;\nfor he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the\nManor House. He was the more noticed as be-\ning the only friend of the past unknown life of Mr.\nDouglas who was ever seen in his new English sur-\nroundings. Barker was himself an undoubted En-\nglishman; but by his remarks it was clear that he\nhad \ufb01rst known Douglas in America and had there\nlived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to\nbe a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed\nto be a bachelor. In\nage\nhe\nwas\nrather\nyounger\nthan\nDouglas\u2014forty-\ufb01ve at the most\u2014a tall, straight,\nbroad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-\n\ufb01ghter face, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a\npair of masterful black eyes which might, even\nwithout the aid of his very capable hands, clear a\nway for him through a hostile crowd. He neither\nrode nor shot, but spent his days in wandering\n673\nThe Valley Of Fear\nround the old village with his pipe in his mouth,\nor in driving with his host, or in his absence with\nhis hostess, over the beautiful countryside. \u201cAn\neasy-going, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said Ames,\nthe butler. \u201cBut, my word! I had rather not be the\nman that crossed him!\u201d He was cordial and inti-\nmate with Douglas, and he was no less friendly\nwith his wife\u2014a friendship which more than once\nseemed to cause some irritation to the husband,\nso that even the servants were able to perceive his\nannoyance. Such was the third person who was\none of the family when the catastrophe occurred. As to the other denizens of the old building,\nit will suf\ufb01ce out of a large household to mention\nthe prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and Mrs.\nAllen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved\nthe lady of some of her household cares. The other\nsix servants in the house bear no relation to the\nevents of the night of January 6th. It was at eleven forty-\ufb01ve that the \ufb01rst alarm\nreached the small local police station, in charge of\nSergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary. Ce-\ncil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the\ndoor and pealed furiously upon the bell. A terri-\nble tragedy had occurred at the Manor House, and\nJohn Douglas had been murdered. That was the\nbreathless burden of his message. He had hurried\nback to the house, followed within a few minutes\nby the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of\nthe crime a little after twelve o\u2019clock, after taking\nprompt steps to warn the county authorities that\nsomething serious was afoot. On reaching the Manor House, the sergeant\nhad found the drawbridge down, the windows\nlighted up, and the whole household in a state of\nwild confusion and alarm. The white-faced ser-\nvants were huddling together in the hall, with the\nfrightened butler wringing his hands in the door-\nway."

At that\nmoment there arrived Dr. Wood, a brisk and ca-\npable general practitioner from the village. The\nthree men entered the fatal room together, while\nthe horror-stricken butler followed at their heels,\nclosing the door behind him to shut out the terri-\nble scene from the maid servants. The dead man lay on his back, sprawling with\noutstretched limbs in the centre of the room. He\nwas clad only in a pink dressing gown, which cov-\nered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers\non his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and\nheld down the hand lamp which had stood on\nthe table. One glance at the victim was enough\nto show the healer that his presence could be dis-\npensed with. The man had been horribly injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a\nshotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front\nof the triggers. It was clear that this had been\n\ufb01red at close range and that he had received the\nwhole charge in the face, blowing his head almost\nto pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so\nas to make the simultaneous discharge more de-\nstructive. The country policeman was unnerved and\ntroubled by the tremendous responsibility which\nhad come so suddenly upon him. \u201cWe will touch\nnothing until my superiors arrive,\u201d he said in a\nhushed voice, staring in horror at the dreadful\nhead. \u201cNothing has been touched up to now,\u201d said\nCecil Barker. \u201cI\u2019ll answer for that. You see it all\nexactly as I found it.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was that?\u201d The sergeant had drawn out\nhis notebook. \u201cIt was just half-past eleven. I had not begun\nto undress, and I was sitting by the \ufb01re in my bed-\nroom when I heard the report. It was not very\nloud\u2014it seemed to be muf\ufb02ed. I rushed down\u2014I\ndon\u2019t suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in\nthe room.\u201d\n\u201cWas the door open?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as\nyou see him. His bedroom candle was burning on\nthe table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes\nafterward.\u201d\n\u201cDid you see no one?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the\nstair behind me, and I rushed out to prevent her\nfrom seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the\nhousekeeper, came and took her away. Ames\nhad arrived, and we ran back into the room once\nmore.\u201d\n\u201cBut surely I have heard that the drawbridge is\nkept up all night.\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was up until I lowered it.\u201d\n\u201cThen how could any murderer have got away? It is out of the question! Mr. Douglas must have\nshot himself.\u201d\n\u201cThat was our \ufb01rst idea.

Then I wound\nit up myself.\u201d\n\u201cThen it comes to this,\u201d said the sergeant:\n\u201cIf anyone came from outside\u2014if they did\u2014they\nmust have got in across the bridge before six and\nbeen in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came\ninto the room after eleven.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house\nevery night the last thing before he turned in to\nsee that the lights were right. That brought him in\nhere. The man was waiting and shot him. Then\nhe got away through the window and left his gun\nbehind him. That\u2019s how I read it; for nothing else\nwill \ufb01t the facts.\u201d\nThe sergeant picked up a card which lay beside\nthe dead man on the \ufb02oor. The initials V. V. and\nunder them the number 341 were rudely scrawled\nin ink upon it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, holding it up. Barker looked at it with curiosity. \u201cI never no-\nticed it before,\u201d he said. \u201cThe murderer must have\nleft it behind him.\u201d\n\u201cV. V.\u2014341. I can make no sense of that.\u201d\nThe sergeant kept turning it over in his big \ufb01n-\ngers. \u201cWhat\u2019s V. V.? Somebody\u2019s initials, maybe. What have you got there, Dr. Wood?\u201d\nIt was a good-sized hammer which had been\nlying on the rug in front of the \ufb01replace\u2014a\nsubstantial, workmanlike hammer.

There was no\nother place where he could hide, so he popped in\nbehind this curtain. That all seems clear enough.

The man has been branded at some time as they\nbrand cattle. What is the meaning of this?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t profess to know the meaning of it,\u201d\nsaid Cecil Barker; \u201cbut I have seen the mark on\nDouglas many times this last ten years.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so have I,\u201d said the butler. \u201cMany a time\nwhen the master has rolled up his sleeves I have\nnoticed that very mark.

I put it to you, Mr. Holmes,\njudging it by what we have heard.\u201d\n\u201cWell, state your case, Mr. Mac,\u201d said Holmes\nin his most judicial style. \u201cThe man is not a burglar, supposing that he\never existed. The ring business and the card point\nto premeditated murder for some private reason. Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house\n677\nThe Valley Of Fear\nwith the deliberate intention of committing mur-\nder. He knows, if he knows anything, that he\nwill have a dee\ufb01culty in making his escape, as the\nhouse is surrounded with water. What weapon\nwould he choose? You would say the most silent in\nthe world. Then he could hope when the deed was\ndone to slip quickly from the window, to wade the\nmoat, and to get away at his leisure. That\u2019s under-\nstandable. But is it understandable that he should\ngo out of his way to bring with him the most noisy\nweapon he could select, knowing well that it will\nfetch every human being in the house to the spot\nas quick as they can run, and that it is all odds that\nhe will be seen before he can get across the moat? Is that credible, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you put the case strongly,\u201d my friend\nreplied thoughtfully. \u201cIt certainly needs a good\ndeal of justi\ufb01cation. May I ask, Mr. White Mason,\nwhether you examined the farther side of the moat\nat once to see if there were any signs of the man\nhaving climbed out from the water?\u201d\n\u201cThere were no signs, Mr. Holmes."

Would there be any objection, Mr. White\nMason, to our going down to the house at once? There may possibly be some small point which\nmight be suggestive.\u201d\n\u201cI was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I\nthought it well to put you in touch with all the\nfacts before we go.

If I have\never separated myself from the of\ufb01cial force, it is\nbecause they have \ufb01rst separated themselves from\nme. I have no wish ever to score at their expense. At the same time, Mr. White Mason, I claim the\nright to work in my own way and give my results\nat my own time\u2014complete rather than in stages.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure we are honoured by your presence\nand to show you all we know,\u201d said White Mason\ncordially. \u201cCome along, Dr. Watson, and when the\ntime comes we\u2019ll all hope for a place in your book.\u201d\nWe walked down the quaint village street with\na row of pollarded elms on each side of it. Just\nbeyond were two ancient stone pillars, weather-\nstained and lichen-blotched bearing upon their\nsummits a shapeless something which had once\nbeen the rampant lion of Capus of Birlstone. A\nshort walk along the winding drive with such\nsward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural\nEngland, then a sudden turn, and the long, low Ja-\ncobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay be-\nfore us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews\non each side of it. As we approached it, there was\nthe wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad\nmoat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the\ncold, winter sunshine. Three centuries had \ufb02owed past the old Manor\nHouse, centuries of births and of homecomings, of\ncountry dances and of the meetings of fox hunters. Strange that now in its old age this dark business\nshould have cast its shadow upon the venerable\nwalls! And yet those strange, peaked roofs and\nquaint, overhung gables were a \ufb01tting covering\nto grim and terrible intrigue. As I looked at the\ndeep-set windows and the long sweep of the dull-\ncoloured, water-lapped front, I felt that no more\n\ufb01tting scene could be set for such a tragedy. \u201cThat\u2019s the window,\u201d said White Mason, \u201cthat\none on the immediate right of the drawbridge. It\u2019s\nopen just as it was found last night.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks rather narrow for a man to pass.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a fat man, anyhow.

If it were suicide,\nthen we have to believe that this man began by tak-\ning off his wedding ring and concealing it; that he\nthen came down here in his dressing gown, tram-\npled mud into a corner behind the curtain in or-\nder to give the idea someone had waited for him,\nopened the window, put blood on the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe can surely dismiss that,\u201d said MacDonald. \u201cSo I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then\na murder has been done. What we have to deter-\nmine is, whether it was done by someone outside\nor inside the house.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s hear the argument.\u201d\n\u201cThere are considerable dif\ufb01culties both ways,\nand yet one or the other it must be. We will sup-\npose \ufb01rst that some person or persons inside the\nhouse did the crime. They got this man down here\nat a time when everything was still and yet no one\nwas asleep. They then did the deed with the queer-\nest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell\neveryone what had happened\u2014a weapon that was\nnever seen in the house before. That does not seem\na very likely start, does it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it does not.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, everyone is agreed that after the\nalarm was given only a minute at the most had\npassed before the whole household\u2014not Mr. Ce-\ncil Barker alone, though he claims to have been\nthe \ufb01rst, but Ames and all of them were on the\nspot."

It\u2019s impossible!\u201d\n\u201cYou put it very clearly,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI am\ninclined to agree with you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, we are driven back to the theory\nthat it was done by someone from outside. We\nare still faced with some big dif\ufb01culties; but any-\nhow they have ceased to be impossibilities. The\nman got into the house between four-thirty and\nsix; that is to say, between dusk and the time when\nthe bridge was raised. There had been some vis-\nitors, and the door was open; so there was noth-\ning to prevent him. He may have been a common\nburglar, or he may have had some private grudge\nagainst Mr. Douglas. Since Mr. Douglas has spent\nmost of his life in America, and this shotgun seems\nto be an American weapon, it would seem that\nthe private grudge is the more likely theory. He\nslipped into this room because it was the \ufb01rst he\ncame to, and he hid behind the curtain. There\nhe remained until past eleven at night. At that\ntime Mr. Douglas entered the room.

The candle, which was a new one,\nis not burned more than half an inch. He must\nhave placed it on the table before he was attacked;\notherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he\nfell. This shows that he was not attacked the in-\nstant that he entered the room.

He demands\nthe wedding ring\u2014Heaven only knows why, but\nso it must have been. Mr. Douglas gave it up. Then either in cold blood or in the course of a\nstruggle\u2014Douglas may have gripped the hammer\nthat was found upon the mat\u2014he shot Douglas\nin this horrible way. He dropped his gun and\nalso it would seem this queer card\u2014V. V. 341,\nwhatever that may mean\u2014and he made his escape\nthrough the window and across the moat at the\nvery moment when Cecil Barker was discovering\nthe crime. How\u2019s that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cVery interesting, but just a little unconvinc-\ning.\u201d\n\u201cMan, it would be absolute nonsense if it\nwasn\u2019t that anything else is even worse!\u201d cried\nMacDonald. \u201cSomebody killed the man, and who-\never it was I could clearly prove to you that he\n679\nThe Valley Of Fear\nshould have done it some other way."

It is rough cardboard. Have you any of the sort in\nthe house?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nHolmes walked across to the desk and dabbed\na little ink from each bottle on to the blotting pa-\nper. \u201cIt was not printed in this room,\u201d he said;\n\u201cthis is black ink and the other purplish. It was\ndone by a thick pen, and these are \ufb01ne. No, it was\ndone elsewhere, I should say. Can you make any-\nthing of the inscription, Ames?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Mac?\u201d\n\u201cIt gives me the impression of a secret society\nof some sort; the same with his badge upon the\nforearm.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my idea, too,\u201d said White Mason. \u201cWell, we can adopt it as a working hypothe-\nsis and then see how far our dif\ufb01culties disappear. An agent from such a society makes his way into\nthe house, waits for Mr. Douglas, blows his head\nnearly off with this weapon, and escapes by wad-\ning the moat, after leaving a card beside the dead\nman, which will when mentioned in the papers,\ntell other members of the society that vengeance\nhas been done."

There was a saddlebag with spanner\nand oilcan, but no clue as to the owner. \u201cIt would be a grand help to the police,\u201d said\nthe inspector, \u201cif these things were numbered and\nregistered.

He had been engaged \ufb01ve years before,\nwhen Douglas \ufb01rst came to Birlstone. He under-\nstood that Mr. Douglas was a rich gentleman who\nhad made his money in America. He had been\na kind and considerate employer\u2014not quite what\nAmes was used to, perhaps; but one can\u2019t have ev-\nerything. He never saw any signs of apprehension\nin Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, he was the most\nfearless man he had ever known. He ordered the\ndrawbridge to be pulled up every night because it\nwas the ancient custom of the old house, and he\nliked to keep the old ways up. Mr. Douglas seldom went to London or left the\nvillage; but on the day before the crime he had\nbeen shopping at Tunbridge Wells. He (Ames) had\nobserved some restlessness and excitement on the\npart of Mr. Douglas that day; for he had seemed\nimpatient and irritable, which was unusual with\nhim. He had not gone to bed that night; but was in\nthe pantry at the back of the house, putting away\nthe silver, when he heard the bell ring violently. He heard no shot; but it was hardly possible he\nwould, as the pantry and kitchens were at the very\nback of the house and there were several closed\ndoors and a long passage between. The house-\nkeeper had come out of her room, attracted by the\nviolent ringing of the bell. They had gone to the\nfront of the house together. As they reached the bottom of the stair he had\nseen Mrs. Douglas coming down it. No, she was\nnot hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was\nparticularly agitated. Just as she reached the bot-\ntom of the stair Mr. Barker had rushed out of the\nstudy. He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and begged\nher to go back. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, go back to your room!\u201d he\ncried. \u201cPoor Jack is dead! You can do nothing. For God\u2019s sake, go back!\u201d\nAfter some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs.\nDouglas had gone back. She did not scream. She\nmade no outcry whatever. Mrs. Allen, the house-\nkeeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her\nin the bedroom. Ames and Mr. Barker had then re-\nturned to the study, where they had found every-\nthing exactly as the police had seen it. The candle\nwas not lit at that time; but the lamp was burn-\ning. They had looked out of the window; but the\nnight was very dark and nothing could be seen\n681\nThe Valley Of Fear\nor heard. They had then rushed out into the hall,\nwhere Ames had turned the windlass which low-\nered the drawbridge. Mr. Barker had then hurried\noff to get the police. Such, in its essentials, was the evidence of the\nbutler. The account of Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper,\nwas, so far as it went, a corroboration of that of\nher fellow servant."

She\nwas preparing to go to bed when the loud ring-\ning of the bell had attracted her attention. She was\na little hard of hearing. Perhaps that was why she\nhad not heard the shot; but in any case the study\nwas a long way off. She remembered hearing some\nsound which she imagined to be the slamming of\na door. That was a good deal earlier\u2014half an hour\nat least before the ringing of the bell. When Mr.\nAmes ran to the front she went with him. She\nsaw Mr. Barker, very pale and excited, come out\nof the study. He intercepted Mrs. Douglas, who\nwas coming down the stairs. He entreated her to\ngo back, and she answered him, but what she said\ncould not be heard. \u201cTake her up! Stay with her!\u201d he had said to\nMrs. Allen. She had therefore taken her to the bedroom,\nand endeavoured to soothe her. She was greatly\nexcited, trembling all over, but made no other at-\ntempt to go downstairs. She just sat in her dress-\ning gown by her bedroom \ufb01re, with her head sunk\nin her hands. Mrs. Allen stayed with her most of\nthe night. As to the other servants, they had all\ngone to bed, and the alarm did not reach them un-\ntil just before the police arrived. They slept at the\nextreme back of the house, and could not possibly\nhave heard anything. So far the housekeeper could add nothing on\ncross-examination save lamentations and expres-\nsions of amazement. Cecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness. As to the occurrences of the night before, he had\nvery little to add to what he had already told the\npolice. Personally, he was convinced that the mur-\nderer had escaped by the window. The bloodstain\nwas conclusive, in his opinion, on that point. Be-\nsides, as the bridge was up, there was no other\npossible way of escaping. He could not explain\nwhat had become of the assassin or why he had\nnot taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. He\ncould not possibly have been drowned in the moat,\nwhich was at no place more than three feet deep. In his own mind he had a very de\ufb01nite the-\nory about the murder. Douglas was a reticent\nman, and there were some chapters in his life of\nwhich he never spoke. He had emigrated to Amer-\nica when he was a very young man. He had\nprospered well, and Barker had \ufb01rst met him in\nCalifornia, where they had become partners in a\nsuccessful mining claim at a place called Benito\nCanyon. They had done very well; but Douglas\nhad suddenly sold out and started for England. He was a widower at that time. Barker had af-\nterwards realized his money and come to live in\nLondon. Thus they had renewed their friendship."

He knew\nthat city well and had worked there. I have heard\nhim talk of the coal and iron districts. He had trav-\nelled a good deal in his time.\u201d\n\u201cWas he a politician? Had this secret society to\ndo with politics?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he cared nothing about politics.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no reason to think it was criminal?\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, I never met a straighter man\nin my life.\u201d\n\u201cWas there anything curious about his life in\nCalifornia?\u201d\n\u201cHe liked best to stay and to work at our claim\nin the mountains. He would never go where other\nmen were if he could help it. That\u2019s why I \ufb01rst\n682\nThe Valley Of Fear\nthought that someone was after him. Then when\nhe left so suddenly for Europe I made sure that it\nwas so. I believe that he had a warning of some\nsort. Within a week of his leaving half a dozen\nmen were inquiring for him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of men?\u201d\n\u201cWell, they were a mighty hard-looking crowd. They came up to the claim and wanted to know\nwhere he was. I told them that he was gone to Eu-\nrope and that I did not know where to \ufb01nd him. They meant him no good\u2014it was easy to see that.\u201d\n\u201cWere these men Americans\u2014Californians?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about Californians. They\nwere Americans, all right. But they were not min-\ners. I don\u2019t know what they were, and was very\nglad to see their backs.\u201d\n\u201cThat was six years ago?\u201d\n\u201cNearer seven.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you were together \ufb01ve years in Cal-\nifornia, so that this business dates back not less\nthan eleven years at the least?\u201d\n\u201cThat is so.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be a very serious feud that would be\nkept up with such earnestness for as long as that. It would be no light thing that would give rise to\nit.\u201d\n\u201cI think it shadowed his whole life."

There\u2019s one thing you should\nknow. He always went about armed. His revolver\nwas never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he\nwas in his dressing gown and had left it in the bed-\nroom last night. Once the bridge was up, I guess\nhe thought he was safe.\u201d\n\u201cI should like these dates a little clearer,\u201d said\nMacDonald. \u201cIt is quite six years since Douglas\nleft California. You followed him next year, did\nyou not?\u201d\n\u201cThat is so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he had been married \ufb01ve years. You must\nhave returned about the time of his marriage.\u201d\n\u201cAbout a month before. I was his best man.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know Mrs. Douglas before her mar-\nriage?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I did not. I had been away from England\nfor ten years.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have seen a good deal of her since.\u201d\nBarker looked sternly at the detective. \u201cI have\nseen a good deal of him since,\u201d he answered. \u201cIf I\nhave seen her, it is because you cannot visit a man\nwithout knowing his wife. If you imagine there is\nany connection\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI imagine nothing, Mr. Barker. I am bound to\nmake every inquiry which can bear upon the case. But I mean no offense.\u201d\n\u201cSome inquiries are offensive,\u201d Barker an-\nswered angrily. \u201cIt\u2019s only the facts that we want. It is in your\ninterest and everyone\u2019s interest that they should be\ncleared up. Did Mr. Douglas entirely approve your\nfriendship with his wife?\u201d\nBarker grew paler, and his great, strong hands\nwere clasped convulsively together. \u201cYou have no\nright to ask such questions!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat has\nthis to do with the matter you are investigating?\u201d\n\u201cI must repeat the question.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I refuse to answer.\u201d\n\u201cYou can refuse to answer; but you must be\naware that your refusal is in itself an answer, for\nyou would not refuse if you had not something to\nconceal.\u201d\nBarker stood for a moment with his face set\ngrimly and his strong black eyebrows drawn low\nin intense thought. Then he looked up with a\nsmile. \u201cWell, I guess you gentlemen are only do-\ning your clear duty after all, and I have no right\nto stand in the way of it. I\u2019d only ask you not to\nworry Mrs. Douglas over this matter; for she has\nenough upon her just now. I may tell you that\npoor Douglas had just one fault in the world, and\nthat was his jealousy. He was fond of me\u2014no man\ncould be fonder of a friend. And he was devoted\nto his wife. He loved me to come here, and was\nforever sending for me. And yet if his wife and I\ntalked together or there seemed any sympathy be-\ntween us, a kind of wave of jealousy would pass\nover him, and he would be off the handle and say-\ning the wildest things in a moment."

That seems very remarkable.\u201d\nAgain Barker showed some signs of indecision. \u201cI don\u2019t see that it was remarkable, Mr. Holmes,\u201d\nhe answered after a pause. \u201cThe candle threw a\nvery bad light. My \ufb01rst thought was to get a better\none. The lamp was on the table; so I lit it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd blew out the candle?\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\nHolmes asked no further question, and Barker,\nwith a deliberate look from one to the other of us,\nwhich had, as it seemed to me, something of de\ufb01-\nance in it, turned and left the room. Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to\nthe effect that he would wait upon Mrs. Douglas\nin her room; but she had replied that she would\nmeet us in the dining room. She entered now, a\ntall and beautiful woman of thirty, reserved and\nself-possessed to a remarkable degree, very dif-\nferent from the tragic and distracted \ufb01gure I had\npictured. It is true that her face was pale and\ndrawn, like that of one who has endured a great\nshock; but her manner was composed, and the\n\ufb01nely moulded hand which she rested upon the\nedge of the table was as steady as my own."

He went from his dressing\nroom, and I did not hear him go. He did the round\nof the house every night, for he was nervous of\n\ufb01re.

He re-\nfused to discuss it with me. It was not from want\nof con\ufb01dence in me\u2014there was the most complete\nlove and con\ufb01dence between us\u2014but it was out\nof his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He\nthought I should brood over it if I knew all, and so\nhe was silent.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know it, then?\u201d\nMrs. Douglas\u2019s face lit with a quick smile. \u201cCan\na husband ever carry about a secret all his life and\na woman who loves him have no suspicion of it?

Then I\nremember that there was a name that came contin-\nually to his lips. He spoke it with anger and a sort\nof horror. McGinty was the name\u2014Bodymaster\nMcGinty.

But before\ndoing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world\ngarden which \ufb02anked the house. Rows of very an-\ncient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it\nround. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with\nan old sundial in the middle, the whole effect so\nsoothing and restful that it was welcome to my\nsomewhat jangled nerves. In that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could\nforget, or remember only as some fantastic night-\nmare, that darkened study with the sprawling,\nbloodstained \ufb01gure on the \ufb02oor. And yet, as I\nstrolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its\ngentle balm, a strange incident occurred, which\nbrought me back to the tragedy and left a sinis-\nter impression in my mind. I have said that a decoration of yew trees circled\nthe garden. At the end farthest from the house\nthey thickened into a continuous hedge. On the\nother side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes\nof anyone approaching from the direction of the\nhouse, there was a stone seat. As I approached\nthe spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the\ndeep tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of\nfeminine laughter. An instant later I had come round the end of\nthe hedge and my eyes lit upon Mrs. Douglas and\nthe man Barker before they were aware of my pres-\nence. Her appearance gave me a shock. In the\ndining-room she had been demure and discreet. Now all pretense of grief had passed away from\nher. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and\nher face still quivered with amusement at some re-\nmark of her companion. He sat forward, his hands\nclasped and his forearms on his knees, with an an-\nswering smile upon his bold, handsome face. In an\ninstant\u2014but it was just one instant too late\u2014they\nresumed their solemn masks as my \ufb01gure came\ninto view. A hurried word or two passed between\nthem, and then Barker rose and came towards me. \u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cbut am I addressing\nDr. Watson?\u201d\nI bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare\nsay, very plainly the impression which had been\n686\nThe Valley Of Fear\nproduced upon my mind. \u201cWe thought that it was probably you, as your\nfriendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes is so well\nknown. Would you mind coming over and speak-\ning to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?\u201d\nI followed him with a dour face. Very clearly\nI could see in my mind\u2019s eye that shattered \ufb01g-\nure on the \ufb02oor. Here within a few hours of the\ntragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laugh-\ning together behind a bush in the garden which\nhad been his. I greeted the lady with reserve. I had\ngrieved with her grief in the dining-room."

I\nassure you that you will be helping us\u2014helping\nme greatly if you will guide us on that point.\u201d\nThere was such a ring of sincerity in the\nwoman\u2019s voice that for the instant I forgot all about\nher levity and was moved only to do her will. \u201cMr. Holmes is an independent investigator,\u201d\nI said. \u201cHe is his own master, and would act as\nhis own judgment directed. At the same time, he\nwould naturally feel loyalty towards the of\ufb01cials\nwho were working on the same case, and he would\nnot conceal from them anything which would help\nthem in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this\nI can say nothing, and I would refer you to Mr.\nHolmes himself if you wanted fuller information.\u201d\nSo saying I raised my hat and went upon my\nway, leaving them still seated behind that conceal-\ning hedge. I looked back as I rounded the far\nend of it, and saw that they were still talking very\nearnestly together, and, as they were gazing after\nme, it was clear that it was our interview that was\nthe subject of their debate. \u201cI\nwish\nnone\nof\ntheir\ncon\ufb01dences,\u201d\nsaid\nHolmes, when I reported to him what had oc-\ncurred.

Well, well, you need not\nbe downcast; for between ourselves I don\u2019t think\nthat either Inspector Mac or the excellent local\npractitioner has grasped the overwhelming impor-\ntance of this incident. One dumb-bell, Watson! Consider an athlete with one dumb-bell! Picture to\nyourself the unilateral development, the imminent\ndanger of a spinal curvature. Shocking, Watson,\nshocking!\u201d\nHe sat with his mouth full of toast and his\neyes sparkling with mischief, watching my intel-\nlectual entanglement. The mere sight of his excel-\nlent appetite was an assurance of success, for I had\nvery clear recollections of days and nights with-\nout a thought of food, when his baf\ufb02ed mind had\nchafed before some problem while his thin, eager\nfeatures became more attenuated with the asceti-\ncism of complete mental concentration. Finally he\nlit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of the old\nvillage inn he talked slowly and at random about\nhis case, rather as one who thinks aloud than as\none who makes a considered statement. \u201cA lie, Watson\u2014a great, big, thumping, obtru-\nsive, uncompromising lie\u2014that\u2019s what meets us\non the threshold! There is our starting point. The\nwhole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker\u2019s\nstory is corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore\n687\nThe Valley Of Fear\nshe is lying also. They are both lying, and in a con-\nspiracy. So now we have the clear problem. Why\nare they lying, and what is the truth which they are\ntrying so hard to conceal? Let us try, Watson, you\nand I, if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct\nthe truth. \u201cHow do I know that they are lying? Because it\nis a clumsy fabrication which simply could not be\ntrue. Consider! According to the story given to us,\nthe assassin had less than a minute after the mur-\nder had been committed to take that ring, which\nwas under another ring, from the dead man\u2019s \ufb01n-\nger, to replace the other ring\u2014a thing which he\nwould surely never have done\u2014and to put that\nsingular card beside his victim. I say that this was\nobviously impossible. \u201cYou may argue\u2014but I have too much respect\nfor your judgment, Watson, to think that you will\ndo so\u2014that the ring may have been taken before\nthe man was killed. The fact that the candle had\nbeen lit only a short time shows that there had\nbeen no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from\nwhat we hear of his fearless character, a man who\nwould be likely to give up his wedding ring at such\nshort notice, or could we conceive of his giving it\nup at all? No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone\nwith the dead man for some time with the lamp\nlit. Of that I have no doubt at all."

But there could\nbe no mistake about such a matter as that. We are\nin the presence, therefore, of a deliberate conspir-\nacy upon the part of the two people who heard\nthe gunshot\u2014of the man Barker and of the woman\nDouglas. When on the top of this I am able to show\nthat the blood mark on the windowsill was delib-\nerately placed there by Barker, in order to give a\nfalse clue to the police, you will admit that the case\ngrows dark against him. \u201cNow we have to ask ourselves at what hour\nthe murder actually did occur. Up to half-past ten\nthe servants were moving about the house; so it\nwas certainly not before that time. At a quarter to\neleven they had all gone to their rooms with the\nexception of Ames, who was in the pantry. I have\nbeen trying some experiments after you left us this\nafternoon, and I \ufb01nd that no noise which MacDon-\nald can make in the study can penetrate to me in\nthe pantry when the doors are all shut. \u201cIt is otherwise, however, from the house-\nkeeper\u2019s room. It is not so far down the corridor,\nand from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it\nwas very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun\nis to some extent muf\ufb02ed when the discharge is at\nvery close range, as it undoubtedly was in this in-\nstance. It would not be very loud, and yet in the si-\nlence of the night it should have easily penetrated\nto Mrs. Allen\u2019s room. She is, as she has told us,\nsomewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned\nin her evidence that she did hear something like a\ndoor slamming half an hour before the alarm was\ngiven. Half an hour before the alarm was given\nwould be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that\nwhat she heard was the report of the gun, and that\nthis was the real instant of the murder. \u201cIf this is so, we have now to determine what\nBarker and Mrs. Douglas, presuming that they are\nnot the actual murderers, could have been doing\nfrom quarter to eleven, when the sound of the\nshot brought them down, until quarter past eleven,\nwhen they rang the bell and summoned the ser-\nvants. What were they doing, and why did they\nnot instantly give the alarm? That is the question\nwhich faces us, and when it has been answered\nwe shall surely have gone some way to solve our\nproblem.\u201d\n\u201cI am convinced myself,\u201d said I, \u201cthat there is\nan understanding between those two people. She\nmust be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some\njest within a few hours of her husband\u2019s murder.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. She does not shine as a wife even\nin her own account of what occurred."

Should I ever marry, Watson, I\nshould hope to inspire my wife with some feeling\nwhich would prevent her from being walked off by\na housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a\nfew yards of her. It was badly stage-managed; for\neven the rawest investigators must be struck by the\nabsence of the usual feminine ululation. If there\nhad been nothing else, this incident alone would\nhave suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my\nmind.\u201d\n\u201cYou think then, de\ufb01nitely, that Barker and\nMrs. Douglas are guilty of the murder?\u201d\n\u201cThere is an appalling directness about your\nquestions, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, shaking his pipe\nat me. \u201cThey come at me like bullets. If you put\nit that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth\nabout the murder, and are conspiring to conceal it,\nthen I can give you a whole-souled answer. I am\nsure they do. But your more deadly proposition\nis not so clear. Let us for a moment consider the\ndif\ufb01culties which stand in the way. 688\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cWe will suppose that this couple are united\nby the bonds of a guilty love, and that they have\ndetermined to get rid of the man who stands be-\ntween them. It is a large supposition; for discreet\ninquiry among servants and others has failed to\ncorroborate it in any way. On the contrary, there\nis a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were\nvery attached to each other.\u201d\n\u201cThat, I am sure, cannot he true.\u201d said I, think-\ning of the beautiful smiling face in the garden. \u201cWell at least they gave that impression. How-\never, we will suppose that they are an extraordi-\nnarily astute couple, who deceive everyone upon\nthis point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be a man over whose head some\ndanger hangs\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe have only their word for that.\u201d\nHolmes looked thoughtful. \u201cI see, Watson. You\nare sketching out a theory by which everything\nthey say from the beginning is false. According\nto your idea, there was never any hidden men-\nace, or secret society, or Valley of Fear, or Boss\nMacSomebody, or anything else. Well, that is a\ngood sweeping generalization. Let us see what\nthat brings us to. They invent this theory to ac-\ncount for the crime. They then play up to the idea\nby leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the\nexistence of some outsider. The stain on the win-\ndowsill conveys the same idea. So does the card on\nthe body, which might have been prepared in the\nhouse. That all \ufb01ts into your hypothesis, Watson. But now we come on the nasty, angular, uncom-\npromising bits which won\u2019t slip into their places."

It\u2019s a mere chance as it is that Mrs. Allen\ndid not start out to inquire for the slamming door. Why did your guilty couple do all this, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cI confess that I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\n\u201cThen again, if a woman and her lover conspire\nto murder a husband, are they going to advertise\ntheir guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding\nring after his death? Does that strike you as very\nprobable, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it does not.\u201d\n\u201cAnd once again, if the thought of leaving a\nbicycle concealed outside had occurred to you,\nwould it really have seemed worth doing when the\ndullest detective would naturally say this is an ob-\nvious blind, as the bicycle is the \ufb01rst thing which\nthe fugitive needed in order to make his escape.\u201d\n\u201cI can conceive of no explanation.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet there should be no combination of\nevents for which the wit of man cannot conceive\nan explanation. Simply as a mental exercise, with-\nout any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a\npossible line of thought. It is, I admit, mere imagi-\nnation; but how often is imagination the mother of\ntruth? \u201cWe will suppose that there was a guilty secret,\na really shameful secret in the life of this man Dou-\nglas. This leads to his murder by someone who is,\nwe will suppose, an avenger, someone from out-\nside. This avenger, for some reason which I con-\nfess I am still at a loss to explain, took the dead\nman\u2019s wedding ring. The vendetta might conceiv-\nably date back to the man\u2019s \ufb01rst marriage, and the\nring be taken for some such reason. \u201cBefore this avenger got away, Barker and the\nwife had reached the room. The assassin con-\nvinced them that any attempt to arrest him would\nlead to the publication of some hideous scandal. They were converted to this idea, and preferred to\nlet him go. For this purpose they probably lowered\nthe bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly,\nand then raised it again. He made his escape, and\nfor some reason thought that he could do so more\nsafely on foot than on the bicycle. He therefore left\nhis machine where it would not be discovered un-\ntil he had got safely away. So far we are within the\nbounds of possibility, are we not?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is possible, no doubt,\u201d said I, with\nsome reserve. \u201cWe have to remember, Watson, that what-\never occurred is certainly something very extraor-\ndinary. Well, now, to continue our supposititious\ncase, the couple\u2014not necessarily a guilty cou-\nple\u2014realize after the murderer is gone that they\nhave placed themselves in a position in which it\nmay be dif\ufb01cult for them to prove that they did\nnot themselves either do the deed or connive at\nit. They rapidly and rather clumsily met the situ-\nation."

That would be the most effec-\ntive of all proofs. But if not\u2014well, the resources\nof science are far from being exhausted.

At present I am only awaiting the return\nof our colleagues from Tunbridge Wells, where\nthey are at present engaged in trying for a likely\nowner to the bicycle.\u201d\nIt was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald\nand White Mason came back from their expedi-\ntion, and they arrived exultant, reporting a great\nadvance in our investigation. \u201cMan, I\u2019ll admeet that I had my doubts if there\nwas ever an outsider,\u201d said MacDonald, \u201cbut that\u2019s\nall past now.

It was at\nTunbridge Wells then that he had become con-\nscious of some danger. It was clear, therefore,\nthat if a man had come over with a bicycle it was\nfrom Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to\nhave come. We took the bicycle over with us and\nshowed it at the hotels. It was identi\ufb01ed at once by\nthe manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging\nto a man named Hargrave, who had taken a room\nthere two days before. This bicycle and a small\nvalise were his whole belongings. He had regis-\ntered his name as coming from London, but had\ngiven no address. The valise was London made,\nand the contents were British; but the man himself\nwas undoubtedly an American.\u201d\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Holmes gleefully, \u201cyou have\nindeed done some solid work while I have been\nsitting spinning theories with my friend!"

There\nwere no papers or letters, and no marking upon\nthe clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his\nbedroom table. He had left the hotel after break-\nfast yesterday morning on his bicycle, and no more\nwas heard of him until our inquiries.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said\nWhite Mason. \u201cIf the fellow did not want the hue\nand cry raised over him, one would imagine that\nhe would have returned and remained at the hotel\nas an inoffensive tourist.

But his description\u2014what\nof that?\u201d\nMacDonald referred to his notebook. \u201cHere we\nhave it so far as they could give it. They don\u2019t seem\nto have taken any very particular stock of him; but\nstill the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are\nall agreed that this about covers the points. He\nwas a man about \ufb01ve foot nine in height, \ufb01fty or\nso years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a grayish\nmoustache, a curved nose, and a face which all of\nthem described as \ufb01erce and forbidding.\u201d\n\u201cWell, bar the expression, that might almost be\na description of Douglas himself,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe is just over \ufb01fty, with grizzled hair and mous-\ntache, and about the same height. Did you get\nanything else?\u201d\n\u201cHe was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a\nreefer jacket, and he wore a short yellow overcoat\nand a soft cap.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the shotgun?\u201d\n\u201cIt is less than two feet long. It could very well\nhave \ufb01tted into his valise. He could have carried it\ninside his overcoat without dif\ufb01culty.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do you consider that all this bears\nupon the general case?\u201d\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said MacDonald, \u201cwhen\nwe have got our man\u2014and you may be sure that I\nhad his description on the wires within \ufb01ve min-\nutes of hearing it\u2014we shall be better able to judge. But, even as it stands, we have surely gone a long\nway. We know that an American calling himself\nHargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago\n690\nThe Valley Of Fear\nwith bicycle and valise. In the latter was a sawed-\noff shotgun; so he came with the deliberate pur-\npose of crime. Yesterday morning he set off for\nthis place on his bicycle, with his gun concealed\nin his overcoat."

Presumably he at\nonce concealed his cycle among the laurels where\nit was found, and possibly lurked there himself,\nwith his eye on the house, waiting for Mr. Douglas\nto come out. The shotgun is a strange weapon to\nuse inside a house; but he had intended to use it\noutside, and there it has very obvious advantages,\nas it would be impossible to miss with it, and the\nsound of shots is so common in an English sport-\ning neighbourhood that no particular notice would\nbe taken.\u201d\n\u201cThat is all very clear,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWell, Mr. Douglas did not appear.

Don\u2019t look so impatient; for I as-\nsure you that even so bald an account as this raises\nsome sort of picture of the past in one\u2019s mind. Per-\nmit me to give you a sample. \u2018Erected in the \ufb01fth\nyear of the reign of James I, and standing upon the\nsite of a much older building, the Manor House of\nBirlstone presents one of the \ufb01nest surviving ex-\namples of the moated Jacobean residence\u2014\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cYou are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!\u201d\n\u201cTut, tut, Mr. Mac!\u2014the \ufb01rst sign of temper I\nhave detected in you. Well, I won\u2019t read it verba-\ntim, since you feel so strongly upon the subject. But when I tell you that there is some account of\nthe taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel\nin 1644, of the concealment of Charles for several\ndays in the course of the Civil War, and \ufb01nally of\na visit there by the second George, you will ad-\nmit that there are various associations of interest\nconnected with this ancient house.\u201d\n692\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no\nbusiness of ours.\u201d\n\u201cIs it not?"

The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of\nknowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You\nwill excuse these remarks from one who, though a\nmere connoisseur of crime, is still rather older and\nperhaps more experienced than yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the \ufb01rst to admit that,\u201d said the detective\nheartily. \u201cYou get to your point, I admit; but you\nhave such a deuced round-the-corner way of doing\nit.\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ll drop past history and get down\nto present-day facts. I called last night, as I have\nalready said, at the Manor House. I did not see\neither Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no neces-\nsity to disturb them; but I was pleased to hear that\nthe lady was not visibly pining and that she had\npartaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was spe-\ncially made to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I\nexchanged some amiabilities, which culminated in\nhis allowing me, without reference to anyone else,\nto sit alone for a time in the study.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! With that?\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cNo, no, everything is now in order. You gave\npermission for that, Mr. Mac, as I am informed. The room was in its normal state, and in it I passed\nan instructive quarter of an hour.\u201d\n\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWell, not to make a mystery of so simple a\nmatter, I was looking for the missing dumb-bell. It\nhas always bulked rather large in my estimate of\nthe case. I ended by \ufb01nding it.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cAh, there we come to the edge of the unex-\nplored. Let me go a little further, a very little fur-\nther, and I will promise that you shall share every-\nthing that I know.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re bound to take you on your own\nterms,\u201d said the inspector; \u201cbut when it comes to\ntelling us to abandon the case\u2014why in the name\nof goodness should we abandon the case?\u201d\n\u201cFor the simple reason, my dear Mr. Mac, that\nyou have not got the \ufb01rst idea what it is that you\nare investigating.\u201d\n\u201cWe are investigating the murder of Mr. John\nDouglas of Birlstone Manor.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, so you are. But don\u2019t trouble to trace\nthe mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle. I as-\nsure you that it won\u2019t help you.\u201d\n\u201cThen what do you suggest that we do?\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you exactly what to do, if you will\ndo it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m bound to say I\u2019ve always found you\nhad reason behind all your queer ways. I\u2019ll do\nwhat you advise.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, Mr. White Mason?\u201d\nThe country detective looked helplessly from\none to the other. Holmes and his methods were\nnew to him. \u201cWell, if it is good enough for the in-\nspector, it is good enough for me,\u201d he said at last. \u201cCapital!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWell, then, I should\nrecommend a nice, cheery country walk for both\nof you. They tell me that the views from Birlstone\nRidge over the Weald are very remarkable."

It is a chill\nevening, and I do not know how long our expe-\ndition may last; so I beg that you will wear your\nwarmest coats. It is of the \ufb01rst importance that we\nshould be in our places before it grows dark; so\nwith your permission we shall get started at once.\u201d\nWe passed along the outer bounds of the\nManor House park until we came to a place where\nthere was a gap in the rails which fenced it. Through this we slipped, and then in the gathering\ngloom we followed Holmes until we had reached\na shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main\ndoor and the drawbridge. The latter had not been\nraised. Holmes crouched down behind the screen\nof laurels, and we all three followed his example. \u201cWell, what are we to do now?\u201d asked Mac-\nDonald with some gruffness. \u201cPossess our souls in patience and make as lit-\ntle noise as possible,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cWhat are we here for at all?"

Surely our profes-\nsion, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if\nwe did not sometimes set the scene so as to glo-\nrify our results. The blunt accusation, the bru-\ntal tap upon the shoulder\u2014what can one make of\nsuch a d\u00b4enouement? But the quick inference, the\nsubtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events,\nthe triumphant vindication of bold theories\u2014are\nthese not the pride and the justi\ufb01cation of our life\u2019s\nwork?

We all had good reason to join in the aspiration;\nfor our vigil was a long and bitter one. Slowly the\nshadows darkened over the long, sombre face of\nthe old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat\nchilled us to the bones and set our teeth chatter-\ning. There was a single lamp over the gateway and\na steady globe of light in the fatal study. Every-\nthing else was dark and still. \u201cHow long is this to last?\u201d asked the inspector\n\ufb01nally. \u201cAnd what is it we are watching for?\u201d\n\u201cI have no more notion than you how long it is\nto last,\u201d Holmes answered with some asperity. \u201cIf\ncriminals would always schedule their movements\nlike railway trains, it would certainly be more con-\nvenient for all of us. As to what it is we\u2014Well,\nthat\u2019s what we are watching for!\u201d\nAs he spoke the bright, yellow light in the\nstudy was obscured by somebody passing to and\nfro before it. The laurels among which we lay\nwere immediately opposite the window and not\nmore than a hundred feet from it. Presently it was\nthrown open with a whining of hinges, and we\ncould dimly see the dark outline of a man\u2019s head\nand shoulders looking out into the gloom. For\nsome minutes he peered forth in furtive, stealthy\nfashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he\nis unobserved. Then he leaned forward, and in the\nintense silence we were aware of the soft lapping\nof agitated water. He seemed to be stirring up the\nmoat with something which he held in his hand. Then suddenly he hauled something in as a \ufb01sher-\nman lands a \ufb01sh\u2014some large, round object which\nobscured the light as it was dragged through the\nopen casement. \u201cNow!\u201d cried Holmes. \u201cNow!\u201d\nWe were all upon our feet, staggering after\nhim with our stiffened limbs, while he ran swiftly\nacross the bridge and rang violently at the bell."

Holmes brushed him aside without a word and,\nfollowed by all of us, rushed into the room which\nhad been occupied by the man whom we had been\nwatching. The oil lamp on the table represented the glow\nwhich we had seen from outside. It was now in the\nhand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us as we\nentered. Its light shone upon his strong, resolute,\nclean-shaved face and his menacing eyes. \u201cWhat the devil is the meaning of all this?\u201d he\ncried. \u201cWhat are you after, anyhow?\u201d\n694\nThe Valley Of Fear\nHolmes took a swift glance round, and then\npounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with\ncord which lay where it had been thrust under the\nwriting table. \u201cThis is what we are after, Mr. Barker\u2014this\nbundle, weighted with a dumb-bell, which you\nhave just raised from the bottom of the moat.\u201d\nBarker stared at Holmes with amazement in his\nface. \u201cHow in thunder came you to know anything\nabout it?\u201d he asked. \u201cSimply that I put it there.\u201d\n\u201cYou put it there! You!\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\nI\nshould\nhave\nsaid\n\u2018replaced\nit\nthere,\u2019 \u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou will remember, Inspec-\ntor MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the\nabsence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to\nit; but with the pressure of other events you had\nhardly the time to give it the consideration which\nwould have enabled you to draw deductions from\nit. When water is near and a weight is missing\nit is not a very far-fetched supposition that some-\nthing has been sunk in the water. The idea was\nat least worth testing; so with the help of Ames,\nwho admitted me to the room, and the crook of\nDr. Watson\u2019s umbrella, I was able last night to \ufb01sh\nup and inspect this bundle. \u201cIt was of the \ufb01rst importance, however, that\nwe should be able to prove who placed it there. This we accomplished by the very obvious device\nof announcing that the moat would be dried to-\nmorrow, which had, of course, the effect that who-\never had hidden the bundle would most certainly\nwithdraw it the moment that darkness enabled\nhim to do so. We have no less than four witnesses\nas to who it was who took advantage of the op-\nportunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word lies\nnow with you.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon\nthe table beside the lamp and undid the cord\nwhich bound it. From within he extracted a dumb-\nbell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the cor-\nner. Next he drew forth a pair of boots. \u201cAmeri-\ncan, as you perceive,\u201d he remarked, pointing to the\ntoes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly,\nsheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle\nof clothing, comprising a complete set of under-\nclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short yel-\nlow overcoat."

I have some recollection, Mr. Barker,\nthat you associated the coal districts with Mr. Dou-\nglas\u2019s \ufb01rst wife, and it would surely not be too far-\nfetched an inference that the V. V. upon the card by\nthe dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or\nthat this very valley which sends forth emissaries\nof murder may be that Valley of Fear of which we\nhave heard. So much is fairly clear. And now, Mr.\nBarker, I seem to be standing rather in the way of\nyour explanation.\u201d\nIt was a sight to see Cecil Barker\u2019s expressive\nface during this exposition of the great detective. Anger, amazement, consternation, and indecision\nswept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a\nsomewhat acrid irony. \u201cYou know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps\nyou had better tell us some more,\u201d he sneered. \u201cI have no doubt that I could tell you a great\ndeal more, Mr. Barker; but it would come with a\nbetter grace from you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you think so, do you? Well, all I can say\nis that if there\u2019s any secret here it is not my secret,\nand I am not the man to give it away.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you take that line, Mr. Barker,\u201d said the\ninspector quietly, \u201cwe must just keep you in sight\nuntil we have the warrant and can hold you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do what you damn please about\nthat,\u201d said Barker de\ufb01antly. The proceedings seemed to have come to a def-\ninite end so far as he was concerned; for one had\nonly to look at that granite face to realize that no\npeine forte et dure would ever force him to plead\nagainst his will. The deadlock was broken, how-\never, by a woman\u2019s voice. Mrs. Douglas had been\nstanding listening at the half opened door, and\nnow she entered the room. \u201cYou have done enough for now, Cecil,\u201d said\nshe. \u201cWhatever comes of it in the future, you have\ndone enough.\u201d\n\u201cEnough and more than enough,\u201d remarked\nSherlock Holmes gravely. \u201cI have every sympa-\nthy with you, madam, and should strongly urge\nyou to have some con\ufb01dence in the common sense\nof our jurisdiction and to take the police volun-\ntarily into your complete con\ufb01dence.

They hunted me from Chicago\n696\nThe Valley Of Fear\nto California, then they chased me out of Amer-\nica; but when I married and settled down in this\nquiet spot I thought my last years were going to be\npeaceable. \u201cI never explained to my wife how things were.

After the bridge\nwas up\u2014my mind was always more restful when\nthat bridge was up in the evenings\u2014I put the thing\nclear out of my head. I never dreamed of his get-\nting into the house and waiting for me. But when\nI made my round in my dressing gown, as was\nmy habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I\nscented danger. I guess when a man has had dan-\ngers in his life\u2014and I\u2019ve had more than most in\nmy time\u2014there is a kind of sixth sense that waves\nthe red \ufb02ag. I saw the signal clear enough, and\nyet I couldn\u2019t tell you why. Next instant I spotted\na boot under the window curtain, and then I saw\nwhy plain enough. \u201cI\u2019d just the one candle that was in my hand;\nbut there was a good light from the hall lamp\nthrough the open door. I put down the candle and\njumped for a hammer that I\u2019d left on the mantel. At the same moment he sprang at me. I saw the\nglint of a knife, and I lashed at him with the ham-\nmer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled\ndown on the \ufb02oor. He dodged round the table as\nquick as an eel, and a moment later he\u2019d got his\ngun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I\nhad got hold of it before he could \ufb01re. I had it by\nthe barrel, and we wrestled for it all ends up for a\nminute or more. It was death to the man that lost\nhis grip. \u201cHe never lost his grip; but he got it butt down-\nward for a moment too long."

I brought down this suit of clothes, and in a\nquarter of an hour Barker and I had put my dress-\ning gown on him and he lay as you found him. We\ntied all his things into a bundle, and I weighted\nthem with the only weight I could \ufb01nd and put\nthem through the window.

It had been a severe winter, and the snow lay\ndeep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains. The steam ploughs had, however, kept the rail-\nroad open, and the evening train which connects\nthe long line of coal-mining and iron-working set-\ntlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep\ngradients which lead from Stagville on the plain\nto Vermissa, the central township which lies at\nthe head of Vermissa Valley. From this point\nthe track sweeps downward to Bartons Crossing,\nHelmdale, and the purely agricultural county of\nMerton. It was a single-track railroad; but at ev-\nery siding\u2014and they were numerous\u2014long lines\nof trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the\nhidden wealth which had brought a rude popula-\ntion and a bustling life to this most desolate corner\nof the United States of America. For desolate it was! Little could the \ufb01rst pi-\noneer who had traversed it have ever imagined\nthat the fairest prairies and the most lush water\npastures were valueless compared to this gloomy\nland of black crag and tangled forest. Above the\ndark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon\ntheir \ufb02anks, the high, bare crowns of the moun-\ntains, white snow, and jagged rock towered upon\neach \ufb02ank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous val-\nley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly\ncrawling. The oil lamps had just been lit in the lead-\ning passenger car, a long, bare carriage in which\nsome twenty or thirty people were seated. The\ngreater number of these were workmen returning\nfrom their day\u2019s toil in the lower part of the val-\nley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces and\nthe safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed\nthemselves miners. These sat smoking in a group\nand conversed in low voices, glancing occasionally\nat two men on the opposite side of the car, whose\nuniforms and badges showed them to be police-\nmen. Several women of the labouring class and one\nor two travellers who might have been small lo-\ncal storekeepers made up the rest of the company,\nwith the exception of one young man in a corner\nby himself. It is with this man that we are con-\ncerned. Take a good look at him, for he is worth\nit. He\nis\na\nfresh-complexioned,\nmiddle-sized\nyoung man, not far, one would guess, from his\nthirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous\ngray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to\ntime as he looks round through his spectacles at\nthe people about him. It is easy to see that he is\nof a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anx-\nious to be friendly to all men. Anyone could pick\nhim at once as gregarious in his habits and com-\nmunicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a\nready smile. And yet the man who studied him\nmore closely might discern a certain \ufb01rmness of\njaw and grim tightness about the lips which would\nwarn him that there were depths beyond, and that\nthis pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman might\nconceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon\nany society to which he was introduced."

It was not a cheering prospect. Through the\ngrowing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the\nfurnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps\nof slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each\nside, with the high shafts of the collieries towering\nabove them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden\nhouses, the windows of which were beginning to\noutline themselves in light, were scattered here\nand there along the line, and the frequent halt-\ning places were crowded with their swarthy inhab-\nitants. The iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa dis-\ntrict were no resorts for the leisured or the cul-\ntured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the\ncrudest battle of life, the rude work to be done,\nand the rude, strong workers who did it. The young traveller gazed out into this dismal\ncountry with a face of mingled repulsion and inter-\nest, which showed that the scene was new to him. At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter\nto which he referred, and on the margins of which\nhe scribbled some notes. Once from the back of\nhis waist he produced something which one would\nhardly have expected to \ufb01nd in the possession of\nso mild-mannered a man. It was a navy revolver\nof the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to\nthe light, the glint upon the rims of the copper\nshells within the drum showed that it was fully\nloaded. He quickly restored it to his secret pocket,\nbut not before it had been observed by a working\nman who had seated himself upon the adjoining\nbench. 701\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cHullo, mate!\u201d said he. \u201cYou seem heeled and\nready.\u201d\nThe young man smiled with an air of embar-\nrassment. \u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cwe need them sometimes in the\nplace I come from.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where may that be?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m last from Chicago.\u201d\n\u201cA stranger in these parts?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou may \ufb01nd you need it here,\u201d said the work-\nman. \u201cAh! is that so?\u201d The young man seemed inter-\nested. \u201cHave you heard nothing of doings here-\nabouts?\u201d\n\u201cNothing out of the way.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, I thought the country was full of it. You\u2019ll hear quick enough. What made you come\nhere?\u201d\n\u201cI heard there was always work for a willing\nman.\u201d\n\u201cAre you a member of the union?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll get your job, I guess.

There\u2019s no town without a lodge, and where there\nis a lodge I\u2019ll \ufb01nd my friends.\u201d\nThe remark had a singular effect upon his com-\npanion. He glanced round suspiciously at the oth-\ners in the car. The miners were still whispering\namong themselves."

But, say, there\u2019s one\nbit of advice I\u2019ll give you before we part: If you\u2019re\nin trouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union\nHouse and see Boss McGinty. He is the Bodymas-\nter of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen\nin these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe we\u2019ll meet in lodge one of\n702\nThe Valley Of Fear\nthese evenings. But mind my words: If you are in\ntrouble, go to Boss McGinty.\u201d\nScanlan descended, and McMurdo was left\nonce again to his thoughts.

Down\nthat long valley there was at least a certain gloomy\ngrandeur in the huge \ufb01res and the clouds of drift-\ning smoke, while the strength and industry of man\nfound \ufb01tting monuments in the hills which he had\nspilled by the side of his monstrous excavations. But the town showed a dead level of mean ugli-\nness and squalor. The broad street was churned\nup by the traf\ufb01c into a horrible rutted paste of\nmuddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and\nuneven. The numerous gas-lamps served only to\nshow more clearly a long line of wooden houses,\neach with its veranda facing the street, unkempt\nand dirty. As they approached the centre of the town the\nscene was brightened by a row of well-lit stores,\nand even more by a cluster of saloons and gam-\ning houses, in which the miners spent their hard-\nearned but generous wages. \u201cThat\u2019s the Union House,\u201d said the guide,\npointing to one saloon which rose almost to the\ndignity of being a hotel. \u201cJack McGinty is the boss\nthere.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of a man is he?\u201d McMurdo asked. \u201cWhat! have you never heard of the boss?\u201d\n703\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cHow could I have heard of him when you\nknow that I am a stranger in these parts?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I thought his name was known clear\nacross the country.

I expect him back\nevery minute.\u201d\nMcMurdo continued to gaze at her in open ad-\nmiration until her eyes dropped in confusion be-\nfore this masterful visitor. \u201cNo, miss,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI\u2019m in no hurry to\nsee him. But your house was recommended to me\nfor board. I thought it might suit me\u2014and now I\nknow it will.\u201d\n\u201cYou are quick to make up your mind,\u201d said\nshe with a smile. \u201cAnyone but a blind man could do as much,\u201d\nthe other answered. She laughed at the compliment. \u201cCome right\nin, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Miss Ettie Shafter, Mr.\nShafter\u2019s daughter. My mother\u2019s dead, and I run\nthe house. You can sit down by the stove in the\nfront room until father comes along\u2014Ah, here he\nis! So you can \ufb01x things with him right away.\u201d\nA heavy, elderly man came plodding up the\npath. In a few words McMurdo explained his busi-\nness. A man of the name of Murphy had given him\nthe address in Chicago. He in turn had had it from\nsomeone else. Old Shafter was quite ready. The\nstranger made no bones about terms, agreed at\nonce to every condition, and was apparently fairly\n\ufb02ush of money. For seven dollars a week paid in\nadvance he was to have board and lodging. So it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed\nfugitive from justice, took up his abode under the\nroof of the Shafters, the \ufb01rst step which was to lead\nto so long and dark a train of events, ending in a\nfar distant land."

Within a week he had become in\ufb01nitely\nthe most important person at Shafter\u2019s. There\nwere ten or a dozen boarders there; but they were\nhonest foremen or commonplace clerks from the\nstores, of a very different calibre from the young\nIrishman. Of an evening when they gathered to-\ngether his joke was always the readiest, his con-\nversation the brightest, and his song the best. He\nwas a born boon companion, with a magnetism\nwhich drew good humour from all around him. And yet he showed again and again, as he had\nshown in the railway carriage, a capacity for sud-\nden, \ufb01erce anger, which compelled the respect and\neven the fear of those who met him. For the law,\ntoo, and all who were connected with it, he exhib-\nited a bitter contempt which delighted some and\nalarmed others of his fellow boarders. From the \ufb01rst he made it evident, by his open\nadmiration, that the daughter of the house had\nwon his heart from the instant that he had set eyes\nupon her beauty and her grace. He was no back-\nward suitor. On the second day he told her that he\nloved her, and from then onward he repeated the\nsame story with an absolute disregard of what she\nmight say to discourage him. \u201cSomeone else?\u201d he would cry. \u201cWell, the\nworse luck for someone else! Let him look out for\nhimself! Am I to lose my life\u2019s chance and all my\nheart\u2019s desire for someone else? You can keep on\nsaying no, Ettie: the day will come when you will\nsay yes, and I\u2019m young enough to wait.\u201d\nHe was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish\ntongue, and his pretty, coaxing ways. There was\nabout him also that glamour of experience and of\nmystery which attracts a woman\u2019s interest, and \ufb01-\nnally her love. He could talk of the sweet val-\nleys of County Monaghan from which he came,\nof the lovely, distant island, the low hills and\ngreen meadows of which seemed the more beauti-\nful when imagination viewed them from this place\nof grime and snow. Then he was versed in the life of the cities\nof the North, of Detroit, and the lumber camps\nof Michigan, and \ufb01nally of Chicago, where he\nhad worked in a planing mill. And afterwards\ncame the hint of romance, the feeling that strange\nthings had happened to him in that great city, so\nstrange and so intimate that they might not be\nspoken of. He spoke wistfully of a sudden leav-\ning, a breaking of old ties, a \ufb02ight into a strange\nworld, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie lis-\ntened, her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with\nsympathy\u2014those two qualities which may turn so\nrapidly and so naturally to love. McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as\nbookkeeper; for he was a well-educated man."

He was reminded of his omission, however, by a\nvisit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow\nmember whom he had met in the train. Scanlan,\nthe small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man,\nseemed glad to see him once more. After a glass\nor two of whisky he broached the object of his visit. \u201cSay, McMurdo,\u201d said he, \u201cI remembered your\naddress, so l made bold to call. I\u2019m surprised\nthat you\u2019ve not reported to the Bodymaster. Why\nhaven\u2019t you seen Boss McGinty yet?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I had to \ufb01nd a job. I have been busy.\u201d\n\u201cYou must \ufb01nd time for him if you have none\nfor anything else. Good Lord, man! you\u2019re a fool\nnot to have been down to the Union House and\nregistered your name the \ufb01rst morning after you\ncame here!

There\nwas something sinister in his eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me that in a month\u2019s time. I hear\nyou had a talk with the patrolmen after I left the\ntrain.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it got about\u2014things do get about for good\nand for bad in this district.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. I told the hounds what I thought of\nthem.\u201d\n\u201cBy the Lord, you\u2019ll be a man after McGinty\u2019s\nheart!\u201d\n705\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cWhat, does he hate the police too?\u201d\nScanlan burst out laughing. \u201cYou go and see\nhim, my lad,\u201d said he as he took his leave. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot the police but you that he\u2019ll hate if you don\u2019t! Now, take a friend\u2019s advice and go at once!\u201d\nIt chanced that on the same evening McMurdo\nhad another more pressing interview which urged\nhim in the same direction. It may have been that\nhis attentions to Ettie had been more evident than\nbefore, or that they had gradually obtruded them-\nselves into the slow mind of his good German\nhost; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house\nkeeper beckoned the young man into his private\nroom and started on the subject without any cir-\ncumlocution. \u201cIt seems to me, mister,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you\nare gettin\u2019 set on my Ettie. Ain\u2019t that so, or am\nI wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that is so,\u201d the young man answered. \u201cVell, I vant to tell you right now that it ain\u2019t no\nmanner of use. There\u2019s someone slipped in afore\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cShe told me so.\u201d\n\u201cVell, you can lay that she told you truth. But\ndid she tell you who it vas?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I asked her; but she wouldn\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\u201cI dare say not, the leetle baggage!"

You\u2019ll \ufb01nd it\nthrough the length and breadth of the States, but\nalways as an innocent one. Now, when I am count-\ning upon joining it here, you tell me that it is the\nsame as a murder society called the Scowrers. I\nguess you owe me either an apology or else an ex-\nplanation, Mr. Shafter.\u201d\n\u201cI can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows,\nmister. The bosses of the one are the bosses of the\nother. If you offend the one, it is the other vat vill\nstrike you. We have proved it too often.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just gossip\u2014I want proof!\u201d said Mc-\nMurdo. \u201cIf you live here long you vill get your proof. But I forget that you are yourself one of them. You vill soon be as bad as the rest. But you vill\n\ufb01nd other lodgings, mister. I cannot have you\nhere.

Yes, indeed, you shall not sleep here after\nto-night!\u201d\nMcMurdo found himself under sentence of\nbanishment both from his comfortable quarters\nand from the girl whom he loved.

You answer me that, Ettie!\u201d\n\u201cBecause no witness dares to appear against\nthem. He would not live a month if he did.

But apart from this popularity, the\nfear in which he was held throughout the town-\nship, and indeed down the whole thirty miles of\nthe valley and past the mountains on each side\nof it, was enough in itself to \ufb01ll his bar; for none\ncould afford to neglect his good will. Besides those secret powers which it was uni-\nversally believed that he exercised in so pitiless\na fashion, he was a high public of\ufb01cial, a mu-\nnicipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads,\nelected to the of\ufb01ce through the votes of the ruf\ufb01-\nans who in turn expected to receive favours at his\nhands. Assessments and taxes were enormous; the\npublic works were notoriously neglected, the ac-\ncounts were slurred over by bribed auditors, and\nthe decent citizen was terrorized into paying pub-\nlic blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some\nworse thing befall him.

At the far end, with his body resting upon the\nbar and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the\ncorner of his mouth, stood a tall, strong, heavily\nbuilt man who could be none other than the fa-\nmous McGinty himself. He was a black-maned gi-\nant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and with a shock\nof raven hair which fell to his collar. His complex-\nion was as swarthy as that of an Italian, and his\neyes were of a strange dead black, which, com-\nbined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly\nsinister appearance. All else in the man\u2014his noble proportions, his\n\ufb01ne features, and his frank bearing\u2014\ufb01tted in with\nthat jovial, man-to-man manner which he affected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow,\nwhose heart would be sound however rude his\noutspoken words might seem. It was only when\nthose dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were\nturned upon a man that he shrank within himself,\nfeeling that he was face to face with an in\ufb01nite pos-\nsibility of latent evil, with a strength and courage\nand cunning behind it which made it a thousand\ntimes more deadly. Having had a good look at his man, McMurdo\nelbowed his way forward with his usual careless\naudacity, and pushed himself through the little\ngroup of courtiers who were fawning upon the\npowerful boss, laughing uproariously at the small-\nest of his jokes."

Come in here for a moment, behind\nthe bar.\u201d\nThere was a small room there, lined with bar-\nrels. McGinty carefully closed the door, and then\nseated himself on one of them, biting thoughtfully\non his cigar and surveying his companion with\nthose disquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes\nhe sat in complete silence. McMurdo bore the in-\nspection cheerfully, one hand in his coat pocket,\nthe other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly\nMcGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking\nrevolver. \u201cSee here, my joker,\u201d said he, \u201cif I thought you\nwere playing any game on us, it would be short\nwork for you.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a strange welcome,\u201d McMurdo an-\nswered with some dignity, \u201cfor the Bodymaster of\na lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.\u201d\n\u201cAy, but it\u2019s just that same that you have to\nprove,\u201d said McGinty, \u201cand God help you if you\nfail!

McMurdo nodded. \u201cWhy did you shoot him?\u201d\n\u201cI was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. Maybe mine were not as good gold as his, but they\nlooked as well and were cheaper to make.

Lodge 341, Vermissa\nOn the day following the evening which had\ncontained so many exciting events, McMurdo\nmoved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter\u2019s and\ntook up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara\u2019s\non the extreme outskirts of the town. Scanlan,\nhis original acquaintance aboard the train, had oc-\ncasion shortly afterwards to move into Vermissa,\nand the two lodged together. There was no other\nboarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old\nIrishwoman who left them to themselves; so that\nthey had a freedom for speech and action welcome\nto men who had secrets in common."

On the contrary, it drew closer and more\nintimate as the weeks went by. In his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt\nit safe to take out the coining moulds, and under\nmany a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers\nfrom the lodge were allowed to come in and see\nthem, each carrying away in his pocket some ex-\namples of the false money, so cunningly struck that\nthere was never the slightest dif\ufb01culty or danger in\npassing it. Why, with such a wonderful art at his\ncommand, McMurdo should condescend to work\nat all was a perpetual mystery to his companions;\nthough he made it clear to anyone who asked him\nthat if he lived without any visible means it would\nvery quickly bring the police upon his track. One policeman was indeed after him already;\nbut the incident, as luck would have it, did the\nadventurer a great deal more good than harm. Af-\nter the \ufb01rst introduction there were few evenings\nwhen he did not \ufb01nd his way to McGinty\u2019s saloon,\nthere to make closer acquaintance with \u201cthe boys,\u201d\nwhich was the jovial title by which the dangerous\ngang who infested the place were known to one\nanother. His dashing manner and fearlessness of\nspeech made him a favourite with them all; while\nthe rapid and scienti\ufb01c way in which he polished\noff his antagonist in an \u201call in\u201d bar-room scrap\nearned the respect of that rough community. An-\nother incident, however, raised him even higher in\ntheir estimation. Just at the crowded hour one night, the door\nopened and a man entered with the quiet blue uni-\nform and peaked cap of the mine police. This was\na special body raised by the railways and colliery\nowners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary\ncivil police, who were perfectly helpless in the face\nof the organized ruf\ufb01anism which terrorized the\ndistrict. There was a hush as he entered, and many\na curious glance was cast at him; but the rela-\ntions between policemen and criminals are pecu-\nliar in some parts of the States, and McGinty him-\nself standing behind his counter, showed no sur-\nprise when the policeman enrolled himself among\nhis customers. \u201cA straight whisky, for the night is bitter,\u201d said\nthe police of\ufb01cer. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have met be-\nfore, Councillor?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be the new captain?\u201d said McGinty. \u201cThat\u2019s so.

Captain\nMarvin is my name.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d do better without you, Captain Marvin,\u201d\nsaid McGinty coldly; \u201cfor we have our own police\nof the township, and no need for any imported\ngoods. What are you but the paid tool of the capi-\ntalists, hired by them to club or shoot your poorer\nfellow citizen?\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, we won\u2019t argue about that,\u201d said\nthe police of\ufb01cer good-humouredly."

He had put off all\nquestions with a smile, as one who did not wish to\nhave greatness thrust upon him. But now the thing\nwas of\ufb01cially con\ufb01rmed. The bar loafers crowded\nround him and shook him heartily by the hand. He was free of the community from that time on. He could drink hard and show little trace of it;\nbut that evening, had his mate Scanlan not been\nat hand to lead him home, the feted hero would\nsurely have spent his night under the bar. On a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced\nto the lodge. He had thought to pass in with-\nout ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago; but\nthere were particular rites in Vermissa of which\nthey were proud, and these had to be undergone\nby every postulant."

Altogether there were not less than\n\ufb01ve hundred scattered over the coal district. In the bare assembly room the men were gath-\nered round a long table. At the side was a sec-\nond one laden with bottles and glasses, on which\nsome members of the company were already turn-\ning their eyes.

Among the older men were\nmany whose features showed the tigerish, lawless\nsouls within; but looking at the rank and \ufb01le it\nwas dif\ufb01cult to believe that these eager and open-\nfaced young fellows were in very truth a danger-\nous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered\nsuch complete moral perversion that they took a\nhorrible pride in their pro\ufb01ciency at the business,\nand looked with deepest respect at the man who\nhad the reputation of making what they called \u201ca\nclean job.\u201d\nTo their contorted natures it had become a spir-\nited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service\nagainst some man who had never injured them,\nand whom in many cases they had never seen in\ntheir lives. The crime committed, they quarrelled\nas to who had actually struck the fatal blow, and\namused one another and the company by describ-\ning the cries and contortions of the murdered man. At \ufb01rst they had shown some secrecy in their\narrangements; but at the time which this narra-\ntive describes their proceedings were extraordinar-\nily open, for the repeated failures of the law had\nproved to them that, on the one hand, no one\nwould dare to witness against them, and on the\nother they had an unlimited number of stanch wit-\nnesses upon whom they could call, and a well-\n\ufb01lled treasure chest from which they could draw\nthe funds to engage the best legal talent in the\nstate. In ten long years of outrage there had\nbeen no single conviction, and the only danger\nthat ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim\nhimself\u2014who, however outnumbered and taken\nby surprise, might and occasionally did leave his\nmark upon his assailants."

Through the plank partition\nhe could hear the murmur of many voices from\n713\nThe Valley Of Fear\nthe assembly within. Once or twice he caught the\nsound of his own name, and he knew that they\nwere discussing his candidacy. Then there entered\nan inner guard with a green and gold sash across\nhis chest. \u201cThe Bodymaster orders that he shall be\ntrussed, blinded, and entered,\u201d said he. The three of them removed his coat, turned up\nthe sleeve of his right arm, and \ufb01nally passed a\nrope round above the elbows and made it fast. They next placed a thick black cap right over his\nhead and the upper part of his face, so that he\ncould see nothing. He was then led into the as-\nsembly hall. It was pitch dark and very oppressive under\nhis hood. He heard the rustle and murmur of the\npeople round him, and then the voice of McGinty\nsounded dull and distant through the covering of\nhis ears. \u201cJohn McMurdo,\u201d said the voice, \u201care you\nalready\na\nmember\nof\nthe\nAncient\nOrder\nof\nFreemen?\u201d\nHe bowed in assent. \u201cIs your lodge No. 29, Chicago?\u201d\nHe bowed again. \u201cDark nights are unpleasant,\u201d said the voice. \u201cYes, for strangers to travel,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe clouds are heavy.\u201d\n\u201cYes, a storm is approaching.\u201d\n\u201cAre the brethren satis\ufb01ed?\u201d asked the Body-\nmaster. There was a general murmur of assent. \u201cWe know, Brother, by your sign and by your\ncountersign that you are indeed one of us,\u201d said\nMcGinty. \u201cWe would have you know, however,\nthat in this county and in other counties of these\nparts we have certain rites, and also certain du-\nties of our own which call for good men. Are you\nready to be tested?\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cAre you of stout heart?\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cTake a stride forward to prove it.\u201d\nAs the words were said he felt two hard points\nin front of his eyes, pressing upon them so that it\nappeared as if he could not move forward without\na danger of losing them. None the less, he nerved\nhimself to step resolutely out, and as he did so the\npressure melted away. There was a low murmur\nof applause. \u201cHe is of stout heart,\u201d said the voice. \u201cCan you\nbear pain?\u201d\n\u201cAs well as another,\u201d he answered. \u201cTest him!\u201d\nIt was all he could do to keep himself from\nscreaming out, for an agonizing pain shot through\nhis forearm. He nearly fainted at the sudden shock\nof it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to\nhide his agony. \u201cI can take more than that,\u201d said he. This time there was loud applause. A \ufb01ner\n\ufb01rst appearance had never been made in the lodge. Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was\nplucked from his head."

You\nwill put the liquor on the table, Brother Scanlan,\nand we will drink to our worthy brother.\u201d\nMcMurdo\u2019s coat had been brought to him; but\nbefore putting it on he examined his right arm,\nwhich still smarted heavily. There on the \ufb02esh of\nthe forearm was a circle with a triangle within it,\ndeep and red, as the branding iron had left it. One\nor two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves\nand showed their own lodge marks. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had it,\u201d said one; \u201cbut not all as\nbrave as you over it.\u201d\n\u201cTut! It was nothing,\u201d said he; but it burned\nand ached all the same. When the drinks which followed the ceremony\nof initiation had all been disposed of, the business\nof the lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed\nonly to the prosaic performances of Chicago, lis-\ntened with open ears and more surprise than he\nventured to show to what followed. \u201cThe \ufb01rst business on the agenda paper,\u201d said\nMcGinty, \u201cis to read the following letter from Divi-\nsion Master Windle of Merton County Lodge 249. He says:\n714\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cDear Sir:\n\u201cThere is a job to be done on An-\ndrew Rae of Rae & Sturmash, coal own-\ners near this place. You will remem-\nber that your lodge owes us a return,\nhaving had the service of two brethren\nin the matter of the patrolman last fall. You will send two good men, they will\nbe taken charge of by Treasurer Hig-\ngins of this lodge, whose address you\nknow. He will show them when to act\nand where. Yours in freedom,\n\u201cJ. W. Windle D. M. A. O. F.\n\u201cWindle has never refused us when we have\nhad occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two,\nand it is not for us to refuse him.\u201d McGinty paused\nand looked round the room with his dull, malevo-\nlent eyes. \u201cWho will volunteer for the job?\u201d\nSeveral young fellows held up their hands. The\nBodymaster looked at them with an approving\nsmile. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, Tiger Cormac. If you handle it as\nwell as you did the last, you won\u2019t be wrong. And\nyou, Wilson.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve no pistol,\u201d said the volunteer, a mere boy\nin his teens. \u201cIt\u2019s your \ufb01rst, is it not? Well, you have to be\nblooded some time. It will be a great start for you. As to the pistol, you\u2019ll \ufb01nd it waiting for you, or\nI\u2019m mistaken. If you report yourselves on Monday,\nit will be time enough."

You just do it for the\nhonour of the thing. Maybe when it is done there\nwill be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has the man done?\u201d asked young Wil-\nson. \u201cSure, it\u2019s not for the likes of you to ask what\nthe man has done. He has been judged over there. That\u2019s no business of ours. All we have to do is\nto carry it out for them, same as they would for\nus. Speaking of that, two brothers from the Mer-\nton lodge are coming over to us next week to do\nsome business in this quarter.\u201d\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d asked someone. \u201cFaith, it is wiser not to ask.

It was felt that\na new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon. To some of the elders it seemed that the progress\nwas a little too rapid. \u201cI would move,\u201d said the secretary, Harraway,\na vulture-faced old graybeard who sat near the\nchairman, \u201cthat Brother McMurdo should wait un-\ntil it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ\nhim.\u201d\n\u201cSure, that was what I meant; I\u2019m in your\nhands,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cYour time will come, Brother,\u201d said the chair-\nman. \u201cWe have marked you down as a willing\nman, and we believe that you will do good work\nin these parts. There is a small matter to-night in\nwhich you may take a hand if it so please you.\u201d\n\u201cI will wait for something that is worth while.\u201d\n\u201cYou can come to-night, anyhow, and it will\nhelp you to know what we stand for in this com-\nmunity."

First of all, I will ask the treasurer as to\nour bank balance. There is the pension to Jim Car-\nnaway\u2019s widow. He was struck down doing the\nwork of the lodge, and it is for us to see that she is\nnot the loser.\u201d\n715\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cJim was shot last month when they tried to\nkill Chester Wilcox of Marley Creek,\u201d McMurdo\u2019s\nneighbour informed him. \u201cThe funds are good at the moment,\u201d said the\ntreasurer, with the bankbook in front of him. \u201cThe\n\ufb01rms have been generous of late. Max Linder &\nCo. paid \ufb01ve hundred to be left alone. Walker\nBrothers sent in a hundred; but I took it on my-\nself to return it and ask for \ufb01ve. If I do not hear\nby Wednesday, their winding gear may get out of\norder. We had to burn their breaker last year be-\nfore they became reasonable. Then the West Sec-\ntion Coaling Company has paid its annual contri-\nbution. We have enough on hand to meet any obli-\ngations.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\nabout\nArchie\nSwindon?\u201d\nasked\na\nbrother. \u201cHe has sold out and left the district. The old\ndevil left a note for us to say that he had rather be\na free crossing sweeper in New York than a large\nmine owner under the power of a ring of black-\nmailers. By Gar! it was as well that he made a\nbreak for it before the note reached us! I guess he\nwon\u2019t show his face in this valley again.\u201d\nAn elderly, clean-shaved man with a kindly\nface and a good brow rose from the end of the ta-\nble which faced the chairman. \u201cMr. Treasurer,\u201d he\nasked, \u201cmay I ask who has bought the property of\nthis man that we have driven out of the district?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Brother Morris. It has been bought by the\nState & Merton County Railroad Company.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who bought the mines of Todman and of\nLee that came into the market in the same way last\nyear?\u201d\n\u201cThe same company, Brother Morris.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who bought the ironworks of Manson\nand of Shuman and of Van Deher and of Atwood,\nwhich have all been given up of late?\u201d\n\u201cThey were all bought by the West Gilmerton\nGeneral Mining Company.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see, Brother Morris,\u201d said the chair-\nman, \u201cthat it matters to us who buys them, since\nthey can\u2019t carry them out of the district.\u201d\n\u201cWith all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster,\nI think it may matter very much to us. This process\nhas been going on now for ten long years. We are\ngradually driving all the small men out of trade. What is the result? We \ufb01nd in their places great\ncompanies like the Railroad or the General Iron,\nwho have their directors in New York or Philadel-\nphia, and care nothing for our threats."

But\nif these big companies \ufb01nd that we stand between\nthem and their pro\ufb01ts, they will spare no pains\nand no expense to hunt us down and bring us to\ncourt.\u201d\nThere was a hush at these ominous words, and\nevery face darkened as gloomy looks were ex-\nchanged. So omnipotent and unchallenged had\nthey been that the very thought that there was pos-\nsible retribution in the background had been ban-\nished from their minds. And yet the idea struck a\nchill to the most reckless of them. \u201cIt is my advice,\u201d the speaker continued, \u201cthat\nwe go easier upon the small men. On the day that\nthey have all been driven out the power of this so-\nciety will have been broken.\u201d\nUnwelcome truths are not popular. There\nwere angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat.

The time has now come for fraternal\nrefreshment and for harmony.\u201d\nStrange indeed is human nature. Here were\nthese men, to whom murder was familiar, who\nagain and again had struck down the father of the\nfamily, some man against whom they had no per-\nsonal feeling, without one thought of compunction\nor of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless\nchildren, and yet the tender or pathetic in music\ncould move them to tears. McMurdo had a \ufb01ne\ntenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the good\nwill of the lodge before, it could no longer have\nbeen withheld after he had thrilled them with \u201cI\u2019m\nSitting on the Stile, Mary,\u201d and \u201cOn the Banks of\nAllan Water.\u201d\nIn his very \ufb01rst night the new recruit had made\nhimself one of the most popular of the brethren,\nmarked already for advancement and high of\ufb01ce. There were other qualities needed, however, be-\nsides those of good fellowship, to make a worthy\n716\nThe Valley Of Fear\nFreeman, and of these he was given an example\nbefore the evening was over.

That\u2019s how he heads it. \u201cReign of terror in the coal and\niron district\n\u201cTwelve years have now elapsed since the\n\ufb01rst assassinations which proved the ex-\nistence of a criminal organization in our\nmidst. From that day these outrages have\nnever ceased, until now they have reached\na pitch which makes us the opprobrium of\nthe civilized world.

As to the lodge,\nwasn\u2019t it the order of the Bodymaster that the man\nwas not to be killed\u2014and what are you doing but\nkilling him?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s truth he says,\u201d remarked one of the men. \u201cBy Gar! you\u2019d best hurry yourselves!\u201d cried\nthe man below. \u201cThe windows are all lighting up,\nand you\u2019ll have the whole town here inside of \ufb01ve\nminutes.\u201d\nThere was indeed the sound of shouting in the\nstreet, and a little group of compositors and press-\nmen was forming in the hall below and nerving\nitself to action. Leaving the limp and motion-\nless body of the editor at the head of the stair,\nthe criminals rushed down and made their way\nswiftly along the street. Having reached the Union\nHouse, some of them mixed with the crowd in\nMcGinty\u2019s saloon, whispering across the bar to the\nBoss that the job had been well carried through. Others, and among them McMurdo, broke away\ninto side streets, and so by devious paths to their\nown homes. CHAPTER IV. The Valley of Fear\nWhen McMurdo awoke next morning he had\ngood reason to remember his initiation into the\nlodge. His head ached with the effect of the drink,\nand his arm, where he had been branded, was hot\nand swollen. Having his own peculiar source of\nincome, he was irregular in his attendance at his\nwork; so he had a late breakfast, and remained at\nhome for the morning writing a long letter to a\n718\nThe Valley Of Fear\nfriend."

        "text": "Afterwards he read the Daily Herald. In a\nspecial column put in at the last moment he read:\nOutrage at the herald office \u2014\nEditor seriously injured\nIt was a short account of the facts with which he\nwas himself more familiar than the writer could\nhave been. It ended with the statement:\nThe matter is now in the hands of the po-\nlice; but it can hardly be hoped that their\nexertions will be attended by any better re-\nsults than in the past. Some of the men\nwere recognized, and there is hope that a\nconviction may be obtained. The source\nof the outrage was, it need hardly be said,\nthat infamous society which has held this\ncommunity in bondage for so long a pe-\nriod, and against which the Herald has\ntaken so uncompromising a stand. Mr.\nStanger\u2019s many friends will rejoice to hear\nthat, though he has been cruelly and bru-\ntally beaten, and though he has sustained\nsevere injuries about the head, there is no\nimmediate danger to his life. Below it stated that a guard of police, armed with\nWinchester ri\ufb02es, had been requisitioned for the\ndefense of the of\ufb01ce. McMurdo had laid down the paper, and was\nlighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky\nfrom the excesses of the previous evening, when\nthere was a knock outside, and his landlady\nbrought to him a note which had just been handed\nin by a lad. It was unsigned, and ran thus:\nI should wish to speak to you, but\nwould rather not do so in your house. You will \ufb01nd me beside the \ufb02agstaff\nupon Miller Hill. If you will come there\nnow, I have something which it is im-\nportant for you to hear and for me to\nsay. McMurdo read the note twice with the utmost\nsurprise; for he could not imagine what it meant\nor who was the author of it. Had it been in a femi-\nnine hand, he might have imagined that it was the\nbeginning of one of those adventures which had\nbeen familiar enough in his past life. But it was\nthe writing of a man, and of a well educated one,\ntoo. Finally, after some hesitation, he determined\nto see the matter through. Miller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very\ncentre of the town. In summer it is a favourite\nresort of the people; but in winter it is desolate\nenough. From the top of it one has a view not only\nof the whole straggling, grimy town, but of the\nwinding valley beneath, with its scattered mines\nand factories blackening the snow on each side of\nit, and of the wooded and white-capped ranges\n\ufb02anking it. McMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged\nin with evergreens until he reached the deserted\nrestaurant which forms the centre of summer gai-\nety. Beside it was a bare \ufb02agstaff, and underneath\nit a man, his hat drawn down and the collar of his\novercoat turned up."

The lodge sign was given and exchanged as\nthey met. \u201cI wanted to have a word with you, Mr. Mc-\nMurdo,\u201d said the older man, speaking with a\nhesitation which showed that he was on delicate\nground. \u201cIt was kind of you to come.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you not put your name to the note?\u201d\n\u201cOne has to be cautious, mister. One never\nknows in times like these how a thing may come\nback to one. One never knows either who to trust\nor who not to trust.\u201d\n\u201cSurely one may trust brothers of the lodge.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, not always,\u201d cried Morris with vehe-\nmence. \u201cWhatever we say, even what we think,\nseems to go back to that man McGinty.\u201d\n\u201cLook here!\u201d said McMurdo sternly. \u201cIt was\nonly last night, as you know well, that I swore\ngood faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be ask-\ning me to break my oath?\u201d\n\u201cIf that is the view you take,\u201d said Morris sadly,\n\u201cI can only say that I am sorry I gave you the trou-\nble to come and meet me. Things have come to a\nbad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their\nthoughts to each other.\u201d\nMcMurdo, who had been watching his com-\npanion very narrowly, relaxed somewhat in his\nbearing. \u201cSure I spoke for myself only,\u201d said he. \u201cI am a newcomer, as you know, and I am strange\nto it all. It is not for me to open my mouth, Mr.\nMorris, and if you think well to say anything to\nme I am here to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to take it back to Boss McGinty!\u201d said\nMorris bitterly. \u201cIndeed, then, you do me injustice there,\u201d cried\nMcMurdo. \u201cFor myself I am loyal to the lodge, and\nso I tell you straight; but I would be a poor creature\nif I were to repeat to any other what you might say\nto me in con\ufb01dence. It will go no further than me;\nthough I warn you that you may get neither help\nnor sympathy.\u201d\n\u201cI have given up looking for either the one or\nthe other,\u201d said Morris. \u201cI may be putting my very\n719\nThe Valley Of Fear\nlife in your hands by what I say; but, bad as you\nare\u2014and it seemed to me last night that you were\nshaping to be as bad as the worst\u2014still you are\nnew to it, and your conscience cannot yet be as\nhardened as theirs. That was why I thought to\nspeak with you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what have you to say?\u201d\n\u201cIf you give me away, may a curse be on you!\u201d\n\u201cSure, I said I would not.\u201d\n\u201cI would ask you, then, when you joined the\nFreeman\u2019s society in Chicago and swore vows of\ncharity and \ufb01delity, did ever it cross your mind\nthat you might \ufb01nd it would lead you to crime?\u201d\n\u201cIf you call it crime,\u201d McMurdo answered."

Was that\ncrime\u2014or what else would you call it?\u201d\n\u201cThere are some would say it was war,\u201d said\nMcMurdo, \u201ca war of two classes with all in, so\nthat each struck as best it could.\u201d\n\u201cWell, did you think of such a thing when you\njoined the Freeman\u2019s society at Chicago?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m bound to say I did not.\u201d\n\u201cNor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia. It\nwas just a bene\ufb01t club and a meeting place for\none\u2019s fellows. Then I heard of this place\u2014curse the\nhour that the name \ufb01rst fell upon my ears!\u2014and I\ncame to better myself! My God! to better my-\nself! My wife and three children came with me. I\nstarted a dry goods store on Market Square, and I\nprospered well. The word had gone round that I\nwas a Freeman, and I was forced to join the local\nlodge, same as you did last night. I\u2019ve the badge\nof shame on my forearm and something worse\nbranded on my heart. I found that I was under\nthe orders of a black villain and caught in a mesh-\nwork of crime. What could I do? Every word I said\nto make things better was taken as treason, same\nas it was last night. I can\u2019t get away; for all I have\nin the world is in my store. If I leave the society,\nI know well that it means murder to me, and God\nknows what to my wife and children. Oh, man,\nit is awful\u2014awful!\u201d He put his hands to his face,\nand his body shook with convulsive sobs. McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \u201cYou were\ntoo soft for the job,\u201d said he. \u201cYou are the wrong\nsort for such work.\u201d\n\u201cI had a conscience and a religion; but they\nmade me a criminal among them. I was chosen for\na job. If I backed down I knew well what would\ncome to me. Maybe I\u2019m a coward. Maybe it\u2019s the\nthought of my poor little woman and the children\nthat makes me one. Anyhow I went. I guess it will\nhaunt me forever. \u201cIt was a lonely house, twenty miles from here,\nover the range yonder. I was told off for the door,\nsame as you were last night. They could not trust\nme with the job. The others went in. When they\ncame out their hands were crimson to the wrists. As we turned away a child was screaming out of\nthe house behind us. It was a boy of \ufb01ve who had\nseen his father murdered. I nearly fainted with\nthe horror of it, and yet I had to keep a bold and\nsmiling face; for well I knew that if I did not it\nwould be out of my house that they would come\nnext with their bloody hands and it would be my\nlittle Fred that would be screaming for his father."

They spent a hilarious night, without an\nanxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning. Nor had they cause, as the result was to show. The magistrate could not possibly, on the evidence,\nhave held them for a higher court.

Cross examined by the clever\nattorney who had been engaged by McGinty, they\nwere even more nebulous in their evidence. The injured man had already deposed that he\nwas so taken by surprise by the suddenness of the\nattack that he could state nothing beyond the fact\nthat the \ufb01rst man who struck him wore a mous-\ntache. He added that he knew them to be Scowr-\ners, since no one else in the community could pos-\nsibly have any enmity to him, and he had long\nbeen threatened on account of his outspoken edi-\ntorials. On the other hand, it was clearly shown by\nthe united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens,\nincluding that high municipal of\ufb01cial, Councillor\nMcGinty, that the men had been at a card party\nat the Union House until an hour very much later\nthan the commission of the outrage. 722\nThe Valley Of Fear\nNeedless to say that they were discharged with\nsomething very near to an apology from the bench\nfor the inconvenience to which they had been put,\ntogether with an implied censure of Captain Mar-\nvin and the police for their of\ufb01cious zeal."

One of them, a little, dark-bearded, resolute\nfellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades\ninto words as the ex-prisoners passed him. \u201cYou damned murderers!\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll \ufb01x\nyou yet!\u201d\nCHAPTER V.\nThe Darkest Hour\nIf anything had been needed to give an impetus\nto Jack McMurdo\u2019s popularity among his fellows\nit would have been his arrest and acquittal. That a\nman on the very night of joining the lodge should\nhave done something which brought him before\nthe magistrate was a new record in the annals of\nthe society. Already he had earned the reputation\nof a good boon companion, a cheery reveller, and\nwithal a man of high temper, who would not take\nan insult even from the all-powerful Boss himself. But in addition to this he impressed his comrades\nwith the idea that among them all there was not\none whose brain was so ready to devise a blood-\nthirsty scheme, or whose hand would be more ca-\npable of carrying it out. \u201cHe\u2019ll be the boy for the\nclean job,\u201d said the oldsters to one another, and\nwaited their time until they could set him to his\nwork. McGinty had instruments enough already; but\nhe recognized that this was a supremely able one. He felt like a man holding a \ufb01erce bloodhound in\nleash. There were curs to do the smaller work; but\nsome day he would slip this creature upon its prey. A few members of the lodge, Ted Baldwin among\nthem, resented the rapid rise of the stranger and\nhated him for it; but they kept clear of him, for he\nwas as ready to \ufb01ght as to laugh. But if he gained favour with his fellows, there\nwas another quarter, one which had become even\nmore vital to him, in which he lost it. Ettie\nShafter\u2019s father would have nothing more to do\nwith him, nor would he allow him to enter the\nhouse. Ettie herself was too deeply in love to give\nhim up altogether, and yet her own good sense\nwarned her of what would come from a marriage\nwith a man who was regarded as a criminal. One morning after a sleepless night she de-\ntermined to see him, possibly for the last time,\nand make one strong endeavour to draw him\nfrom those evil in\ufb02uences which were sucking him\ndown. She went to his house, as he had often\nbegged her to do, and made her way into the room\nwhich he used as his sitting-room. He was seated\nat a table, with his back turned and a letter in front\nof him. A sudden spirit of girlish mischief came\nover her\u2014she was still only nineteen. He had not\nheard her when she pushed open the door."

If she had expected to startle him, she certainly\nsucceeded; but only in turn to be startled her-\nself. With a tiger spring he turned on her, and\nhis right hand was feeling for her throat. At the\nsame instant with the other hand he crumpled up\nthe paper that lay before him. For an instant he\nstood glaring. Then astonishment and joy took\nthe place of the ferocity which had convulsed his\nfeatures\u2014a ferocity which had sent her shrinking\nback in horror as from something which had never\nbefore intruded into her gentle life. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d said he, mopping his brow. \u201cAnd\nto think that you should come to me, heart of my\nheart, and I should \ufb01nd nothing better to do than\nto want to strangle you!

Oh, Jack, if your con-\nscience was at ease, you would not have looked at\nme like that!\u201d\n\u201cSure, I was thinking of other things, and when\nyou came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of\nyours\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it was more than that, Jack.\u201d Then a\nsudden suspicion seized her. \u201cLet me see that let-\nter you were writing.\u201d\n\u201cAh, Ettie, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nHer suspicions became certainties. \u201cIt\u2019s to an-\nother woman,\u201d she cried. \u201cI know it! Why else\nshould you hold it from me? Was it to your wife\nthat you were writing? How am I to know that\nyou are not a married man\u2014you, a stranger, that\nnobody knows?\u201d\n\u201cI am not married, Ettie. See now, I swear it! You\u2019re the only one woman on earth to me. By the\ncross of Christ I swear it!\u201d\nHe was so white with passionate earnestness\nthat she could not but believe him. \u201cWell, then,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhy will you not show\nme the letter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, acushla,\u201d said he. \u201cI\u2019m under oath\nnot to show it, and just as I wouldn\u2019t break my\nword to you so I would keep it to those who hold\nmy promise. It\u2019s the business of the lodge, and\neven to you it\u2019s secret. And if I was scared when\na hand fell on me, can\u2019t you understand it when it\nmight have been the hand of a detective?\u201d\nShe felt that he was telling the truth. He gath-\nered her into his arms and kissed away her fears\nand doubts. \u201cSit here by me, then. It\u2019s a queer throne for\nsuch a queen; but it\u2019s the best your poor lover can\n\ufb01nd."

But within a\nyear at the furthest we will leave the valley behind\nus.\u201d\nIt was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet\nit was something. There was this distant light to\nilluminate the gloom of the immediate future. She\nreturned to her father\u2019s house more light-hearted\n724\nThe Valley Of Fear\nthan she had ever been since Jack McMurdo had\ncome into her life. It might be thought that as a member, all\nthe doings of the society would be told to him;\nbut he was soon to discover that the organiza-\ntion was wider and more complex than the sim-\nple lodge. Even Boss McGinty was ignorant as to\nmany things; for there was an of\ufb01cial named the\nCounty Delegate, living at Hobson\u2019s Patch farther\ndown the line, who had power over several dif-\nferent lodges which he wielded in a sudden and\narbitrary way. Only once did McMurdo see him, a\nsly, little gray-haired rat of a man, with a slinking\ngait and a sidelong glance which was charged with\nmalice. Evans Pott was his name, and even the\ngreat Boss of Vermissa felt towards him something\nof the repulsion and fear which the huge Danton\nmay have felt for the puny but dangerous Robe-\nspierre. One day Scanlan, who was McMurdo\u2019s fel-\nlow boarder, received a note from McGinty in-\nclosing one from Evans Pott, which informed him\nthat he was sending over two good men, Lawler\nand Andrews, who had instructions to act in the\nneighbourhood; though it was best for the cause\nthat no particulars as to their objects should be\ngiven. Would the Bodymaster see to it that suit-\nable arrangements be made for their lodgings and\ncomfort until the time for action should arrive? McGinty added that it was impossible for anyone\nto remain secret at the Union House, and that,\ntherefore, he would be obliged if McMurdo and\nScanlan would put the strangers up for a few days\nin their boarding house. The same evening the two men arrived, each\ncarrying his gripsack. Lawler was an elderly man,\nshrewd, silent, and self-contained, clad in an old\nblack frock coat, which with his soft felt hat and\nragged, grizzled beard gave him a general resem-\nblance to an itinerant preacher. His companion\nAndrews was little more than a boy, frank-faced\nand cheerful, with the breezy manner of one who\nis out for a holiday and means to enjoy every\nminute of it. Both men were total abstainers, and\nbehaved in all ways as exemplary members of the\nsociety, with the one simple exception that they\nwere assassins who had often proved themselves\nto be most capable instruments for this association\nof murder. Lawler had already carried out four-\nteen commissions of the kind, and Andrews three."

They were reticent, however, as to the im-\nmediate job in hand. \u201cThey chose us because neither I nor the boy\nhere drink,\u201d Lawler explained. \u201cThey can count\non us saying no more than we should. You must\nnot take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County\nDelegate that we obey.\u201d\n\u201cSure, we are all in it together,\u201d said Scanlan,\nMcMurdo\u2019s mate, as the four sat together at sup-\nper. \u201cThat\u2019s true enough, and we\u2019ll talk till the cows\ncome home of the killing of Charlie Williams or of\nSimon Bird, or any other job in the past. But till\nthe work is done we say nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThere are half a dozen about here that I have\na word to say to,\u201d said McMurdo, with an oath. \u201cI\nsuppose it isn\u2019t Jack Knox of Ironhill that you are\nafter.

In spite of the reticence of their guests, Scan-\nlan and McMurdo were quite determined to be\npresent at what they called \u201cthe fun.\u201d When, there-\nfore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo\nheard them creeping down the stairs he awak-\nened Scanlan, and the two hurried on their clothes. When they were dressed they found that the oth-\ners had stolen out, leaving the door open behind\nthem. It was not yet dawn, and by the light of the\nlamps they could see the two men some distance\ndown the street. They followed them warily, tread-\ning noiselessly in the deep snow. The boarding house was near the edge of the\ntown, and soon they were at the crossroads which\nis beyond its boundary. Here three men were\nwaiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a\nshort, eager conversation. Then they all moved on\ntogether. It was clearly some notable job which\nneeded numbers. At this point there are several\ntrails which lead to various mines. The strangers\ntook that which led to the Crow Hill, a huge busi-\nness which was in strong hands which had been\nable, thanks to their energetic and fearless New\nEngland manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to keep some\norder and discipline during the long reign of ter-\nror. 725\nThe Valley Of Fear\nDay was breaking now, and a line of work-\nmen were slowly making their way, singly and in\ngroups, along the blackened path. McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the oth-\ners, keeping in sight of the men whom they fol-\nlowed. A thick mist lay over them, and from the\nheart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam\nwhistle."

When they reached the open space round the\nmine shaft there were a hundred miners waiting,\nstamping their feet and blowing on their \ufb01ngers;\nfor it was bitterly cold. The strangers stood in a\nlittle group under the shadow of the engine house. Scanlan and McMurdo climbed a heap of slag from\nwhich the whole scene lay before them. They\nsaw the mine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman\nnamed Menzies, come out of the engine house and\nblow his whistle for the cages to be lowered. At the same instant a tall, loose-framed young\nman with a clean-shaved, earnest face advanced\neagerly towards the pit head. As he came for-\nward his eyes fell upon the group, silent and mo-\ntionless, under the engine house. The men had\ndrawn down their hats and turned up their collars\nto screen their faces. For a moment the presenti-\nment of Death laid its cold hand upon the man-\nager\u2019s heart. At the next he had shaken it off and\nsaw only his duty towards intrusive strangers. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked as he advanced. \u201cWhat are you loitering there for?\u201d\nThere was no answer; but the lad Andrews\nstepped forward and shot him in the stomach. The\nhundred waiting miners stood as motionless and\nhelpless as if they were paralyzed. The manager\nclapped his two hands to the wound and doubled\nhimself up. Then he staggered away; but another\nof the assassins \ufb01red, and he went down sidewise,\nkicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers. Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar of rage at the\nsight and rushed with an iron spanner at the mur-\nderers; but was met by two balls in the face which\ndropped him dead at their very feet. There was a surge forward of some of the min-\ners, and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger;\nbut a couple of the strangers emptied their six-\nshooters over the heads of the crowd, and they\nbroke and scattered, some of them rushing wildly\nback to their homes in Vermissa. When a few of the bravest had rallied, and\nthere was a return to the mine, the murderous\ngang had vanished in the mists of morning, with-\nout a single witness being able to swear to the\nidentity of these men who in front of a hundred\nspectators had wrought this double crime. Scanlan and McMurdo made their way back;\nScanlan somewhat subdued, for it was the \ufb01rst\nmurder job that he had seen with his own eyes,\nand it appeared less funny than he had been led\nto believe. The horrible screams of the dead man-\nager\u2019s wife pursued them as they hurried to the\ntown. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but\nhe showed no sympathy for the weakening of his\ncompanion. \u201cSure, it is like a war,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat is it\nbut a war between us and them, and we hit back\nwhere we best can.\u201d\nThere was high revel in the lodge room at the\nUnion House that night, not only over the killing\nof the manager and engineer of the Crow Hill\nmine, which would bring this organization into\nline with the other blackmailed and terror-stricken\ncompanies of the district, but also over a distant\ntriumph which had been wrought by the hands of\nthe lodge itself."

He had insisted, however,\nupon ef\ufb01ciency in the work, and had, therefore,\npaid off certain drunken and idle employees who\nwere members of the all-powerful society. Cof\ufb01n\nnotices hung outside his door had not weakened\nhis resolution, and so in a free, civilized country\nhe found himself condemned to death. The execution had now been duly carried out. Ted Baldwin, who sprawled now in the seat of\nhonour beside the Bodymaster, had been chief of\nthe party. His \ufb02ushed face and glazed, blood-shot\neyes told of sleeplessness and drink. He and his\ntwo comrades had spent the night before among\nthe mountains. They were unkempt and weather-\nstained. But no heroes, returning from a forlorn\nhope, could have had a warmer welcome from\ntheir comrades. The story was told and retold amid cries of de-\nlight and shouts of laughter. They had waited for\ntheir man as he drove home at nightfall, taking\ntheir station at the top of a steep hill, where his\nhorse must be at a walk. He was so furred to\nkeep out the cold that he could not lay his hand\non his pistol. They had pulled him out and shot\n726\nThe Valley Of Fear\nhim again and again. He had screamed for mercy. The screams were repeated for the amusement of\nthe lodge. \u201cLet\u2019s hear again how he squealed,\u201d they cried. None of them knew the man; but there is eter-\nnal drama in a killing, and they had shown the\nScowrers of Gilmerton that the Vermissa men were\nto be relied upon. There had been one contretemps; for a man and\nhis wife had driven up while they were still empty-\ning their revolvers into the silent body. It had been\nsuggested that they should shoot them both; but\nthey were harmless folk who were not connected\nwith the mines, so they were sternly bidden to\ndrive on and keep silent, lest a worse thing befall\nthem. And so the blood-mottled \ufb01gure had been\nleft as a warning to all such hard-hearted employ-\ners, and the three noble avengers had hurried off\ninto the mountains where unbroken nature comes\ndown to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag\nheaps. Here they were, safe and sound, their work\nwell done, and the plaudits of their companions in\ntheir ears. It had been a great day for the Scowrers. The\nshadow had fallen even darker over the valley. But\nas the wise general chooses the moment of victory\nin which to redouble his efforts, so that his foes\nmay have no time to steady themselves after dis-\naster, so Boss McGinty, looking out upon the scene\nof his operations with his brooding and malicious\neyes, had devised a new attack upon those who\nopposed him."

Two nights later they met outside the town,\nall three armed, and one of them carrying a sack\nstuffed with the powder which was used in the\n727\nThe Valley Of Fear\nquarries. It was two in the morning before they\ncame to the lonely house. The night was a windy\none, with broken clouds drifting swiftly across\nthe face of a three-quarter moon. They had been\nwarned to be on their guard against bloodhounds;\nso they moved forward cautiously, with their pis-\ntols cocked in their hands. But there was no sound\nsave the howling of the wind, and no movement\nbut the swaying branches above them. McMurdo listened at the door of the lonely\nhouse; but all was still within. Then he leaned the\npowder bag against it, ripped a hole in it with his\nknife, and attached the fuse. When it was well\nalight he and his two companions took to their\nheels, and were some distance off, safe and snug\nin a sheltering ditch, before the shattering roar of\nthe explosion, with the low, deep rumble of the\ncollapsing building, told them that their work was\ndone. No cleaner job had ever been carried out in\nthe bloodstained annals of the society. But alas that work so well organized and boldly\ncarried out should all have gone for nothing! Warned by the fate of the various victims, and\nknowing that he was marked down for destruc-\ntion, Chester Wilcox had moved himself and his\nfamily only the day before to some safer and less\nknown quarters, where a guard of police should\nwatch over them. It was an empty house which\nhad been torn down by the gunpowder, and the\ngrim old colour sergeant of the war was still teach-\ning discipline to the miners of Iron Dike. \u201cLeave him to me,\u201d said McMurdo. \u201cHe\u2019s my\nman, and I\u2019ll get him sure if I have to wait a year\nfor him.\u201d\nA vote of thanks and con\ufb01dence was passed in\nfull lodge, and so for the time the matter ended. When a few weeks later it was reported in the pa-\npers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambus-\ncade, it was an open secret that McMurdo was still\nat work upon his un\ufb01nished job. Such were the methods of the Society of\nFreemen, and such were the deeds of the Scowr-\ners by which they spread their rule of fear over\nthe great and rich district which was for so long\na period haunted by their terrible presence. Why\nshould these pages be stained by further crimes? Have I not said enough to show the men and their\nmethods?"

There one may learn of the shooting of Po-\nlicemen Hunt and Evans because they had ven-\ntured to arrest two members of the society\u2014a dou-\nble outrage planned at the Vermissa lodge and car-\nried out in cold blood upon two helpless and dis-\narmed men. There also one may read of the shoot-\ning of Mrs. Larbey when she was nursing her hus-\nband, who had been beaten almost to death by or-\nders of Boss McGinty. The killing of the elder Jenk-\nins, shortly followed by that of his brother, the mu-\ntilation of James Murdoch, the blowing up of the\nStaphouse family, and the murder of the Stendals\nall followed hard upon one another in the same\nterrible winter. Darkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear. The spring had come with running brooks and\nblossoming trees. There was hope for all Nature\nbound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was\nthere any hope for the men and women who lived\nunder the yoke of the terror. Never had the cloud\nabove them been so dark and hopeless as in the\nearly summer of the year 1875. CHAPTER VI. Danger\nIt was the height of the reign of terror. Mc-\nMurdo, who had already been appointed Inner\nDeacon, with every prospect of some day succeed-\ning McGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary\nto the councils of his comrades that nothing was\ndone without his help and advice. The more pop-\nular he became, however, with the Freemen, the\nblacker were the scowls which greeted him as he\npassed along the streets of Vermissa. In spite of\ntheir terror the citizens were taking heart to band\nthemselves together against their oppressors. Ru-\nmours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings\nin the Herald of\ufb01ce and of distribution of \ufb01rearms\namong the law-abiding people. But McGinty and\n728\nThe Valley Of Fear\nhis men were undisturbed by such reports. They\nwere numerous, resolute, and well armed. Their\nopponents were scattered and powerless. It would\nall end, as it had done in the past, in aimless talk\nand possibly in impotent arrests. So said McGinty,\nMcMurdo, and all the bolder spirits. It was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday\nwas always the lodge night, and McMurdo was\nleaving his house to attend it when Morris, the\nweaker brother of the order, came to see him. His\nbrow was creased with care, and his kindly face\nwas drawn and haggard. \u201cCan I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t forget that I spoke my heart to you\nonce, and that you kept it to yourself, even though\nthe Boss himself came to ask you about it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else could I do if you trusted me? It\nwasn\u2019t that I agreed with what you said.\u201d\n\u201cI know that well. But you are the one that I\ncan speak to and be safe."

He was\ntrembling in every limb. He poured some whisky\ninto a glass and handed it to him. \u201cThat\u2019s the\nphysic for the likes of you,\u201d said he. \u201cNow let me\nhear of it.\u201d\nMorris drank, and his white face took a tinge\nof colour. \u201cI can tell it to you all in one sentence,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cThere\u2019s a detective on our trail.\u201d\nMcMurdo\nstared\nat\nhim\nin\nastonishment. \u201cWhy, man, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t the place\nfull of police and detectives and what harm did\nthey ever do us?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s no man of the district. As you say,\nwe know them, and it is little that they can do. But\nyou\u2019ve heard of Pinkerton\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve read of some folk of that name.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you can take it from me you\u2019ve no show\nwhen they are on your trail. It\u2019s not a take-it-or-\nmiss-it government concern. It\u2019s a dead earnest\nbusiness proposition that\u2019s out for results and\nkeeps out till by hook or crook it gets them.

Didn\u2019t I say to you that\nit would end in murder?\u201d\n\u201cSure, what is murder? Isn\u2019t it common\nenough in these parts?\u201d\n\u201cIt is, indeed; but it\u2019s not for me to point out\nthe man that is to be murdered. I\u2019d never rest easy\nagain. And yet it\u2019s our own necks that may be at\nstake. In God\u2019s name what shall I do?\u201d He rocked\nto and fro in his agony of indecision. But his words had moved McMurdo deeply. It\nwas easy to see that he shared the other\u2019s opinion\nas to the danger, and the need for meeting it. He\ngripped Morris\u2019s shoulder and shook him in his\nearnestness. \u201cSee here, man,\u201d he cried, and he almost\nscreeched the words in his excitement, \u201cyou won\u2019t\ngain anything by sitting keening like an old wife\nat a wake. Let\u2019s have the facts. Who is the fellow? Where is he? How did you hear of him? Why did\nyou come to me?\u201d\n\u201cI came to you; for you are the one man that\nwould advise me. I told you that I had a store\nin the East before I came here. I left good friends\nbehind me, and one of them is in the telegraph ser-\nvice. Here\u2019s a letter that I had from him yesterday.

We\nwill \ufb01x him before he can do any harm. See here,\nMorris, will you leave this thing in my hands?\u201d\n\u201cSure, if you will only take it off mine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that. You can stand right back and let\nme run it. Even your name need not be mentioned. I\u2019ll take it all on myself, as if it were to me that this\nletter has come. Will that content you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what I would ask.\u201d\n\u201cThen leave it at that and keep your head shut. Now I\u2019ll get down to the lodge, and we\u2019ll soon\nmake old man Pinkerton sorry for himself.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kill this man?\u201d\n\u201cThe less you know, Friend Morris, the easier\nyour conscience will be, and the better you will\nsleep. Ask no questions, and let these things settle\nthemselves. I have hold of it now.\u201d\nMorris shook his head sadly as he left. \u201cI feel\nthat his blood is on my hands,\u201d he groaned. \u201cSelf-protection is no murder, anyhow,\u201d said\nMcMurdo, smiling grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s him or us. I guess\nthis man would destroy us all if we left him long\nin the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we\u2019ll have to\nelect you Bodymaster yet; for you\u2019ve surely saved\nthe lodge.\u201d\nAnd yet it was clear from his actions that he\nthought more seriously of this new intrusion than\nhis words would show."

Ev-\nery paper which would incriminate him was de-\nstroyed before he left the house. After that he gave\na long sigh of satisfaction; for it seemed to him\nthat he was safe.

Leave it at that, McMurdo. At\nnine to-morrow we\u2019ll be with you. You once get\nthe door shut behind him, and you can leave the\nrest with us.\u201d\n732\nThe Valley Of Fear\nCHAPTER VII. The Trapping of Birdy Edwards\nAs McMurdo had said, the house in which he\nlived was a lonely one and very well suited for\nsuch a crime as they had planned. It was on the\nextreme fringe of the town and stood well back\nfrom the road. In any other case the conspirators\nwould have simply called out their man, as they\nhad many a time before, and emptied their pis-\ntols into his body; but in this instance it was very\nnecessary to \ufb01nd out how much he knew, how he\nknew it, and what had been passed on to his em-\nployers. It was possible that they were already too late\nand that the work had been done. If that was\nindeed so, they could at least have their revenge\nupon the man who had done it. But they were\nhopeful that nothing of great importance had yet\ncome to the detective\u2019s knowledge, as otherwise,\nthey argued, he would not have troubled to write\ndown and forward such trivial information as Mc-\nMurdo claimed to have given him. However, all\nthis they would learn from his own lips. Once in\ntheir power, they would \ufb01nd a way to make him\nspeak. It was not the \ufb01rst time that they had han-\ndled an unwilling witness. McMurdo went to Hobson\u2019s Patch as agreed. The police seemed to take particular interest in\nhim that morning, and Captain Marvin\u2014he who\nhad claimed the old acquaintance with him at\nChicago\u2014actually addressed him as he waited at\nthe station. McMurdo turned away and refused to\nspeak with him. He was back from his mission\nin the afternoon, and saw McGinty at the Union\nHouse. \u201cHe is coming,\u201d he said. \u201cGood!\u201d said McGinty. The giant was in\nhis shirt sleeves, with chains and seals gleaming\nathwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twin-\nkling through the fringe of his bristling beard. Drink and politics had made the Boss a very rich as\nwell as powerful man. The more terrible, therefore,\nseemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows\nwhich had risen before him the night before. \u201cDo you reckon he knows much?\u201d he asked\nanxiously. McMurdo shook his head gloomily. \u201cHe\u2019s been\nhere some time\u2014six weeks at the least. I guess he\ndidn\u2019t come into these parts to look at the prospect. If he has been working among us all that time with\nthe railroad money at his back, I should expect that\nhe has got results, and that he has passed them\non.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a weak man in the lodge,\u201d cried\nMcGinty. \u201cTrue as steel, every man of them."

But I \ufb01lled him up\nabout constitutions and books of rules and forms\nof membership. He expects to get right down to\nthe end of everything before he leaves.\u201d\n\u201cFaith, he\u2019s right there,\u201d said McGinty grimly. \u201cDidn\u2019t he ask you why you didn\u2019t bring him the\npapers?\u201d\n\u201cAs if I would carry such things, and me a sus-\npected man, and Captain Marvin after speaking to\nme this very day at the depot!\u201d\n\u201cAy, I heard of that,\u201d said McGinty. \u201cI guess\nthe heavy end of this business is coming on to you. We could put him down an old shaft when we\u2019ve\ndone with him; but however we work it we can\u2019t\nget past the man living at Hobson\u2019s Patch and you\nbeing there to-day.\u201d\n733\nThe Valley Of Fear\nMcMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIf we han-\ndle it right, they can never prove the killing,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cNo one can see him come to the house after\ndark, and I\u2019ll lay to it that no one will see him go. Now see here, Councillor, I\u2019ll show you my plan\nand I\u2019ll ask you to \ufb01t the others into it. You will\nall come in good time. Very well. He comes at ten.

When he had returned home he made his own\npreparations for the grim evening in front of him. First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith &\nWesson revolver. Then he surveyed the room in\nwhich the detective was to be trapped. It was a\nlarge apartment, with a long deal table in the cen-\ntre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the\nother sides were windows. There were no shutters\non these: only light curtains which drew across. McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it\nmust have struck him that the apartment was very\nexposed for so secret a meeting. Yet its distance\nfrom the road made it of less consequence. Finally\nhe discussed the matter with his fellow lodger. Scanlan, though a Scowrer, was an inoffensive lit-\ntle man who was too weak to stand against the\nopinion of his comrades, but was secretly horri\ufb01ed\nby the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes\nbeen forced to assist. McMurdo told him shortly\nwhat was intended. \u201cAnd if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take\na night off and keep clear of it. There will be\nbloody work here before morning.\u201d\n\u201cWell, indeed then, Mac,\u201d Scanlan answered."

I\u2019m not made for it, same as you or McGinty. If the\nlodge will think none the worse of me, I\u2019ll just do\nas you advise and leave you to yourselves for the\nevening.\u201d\nThe men came in good time as arranged. They\nwere outwardly respectable citizens, well clad and\ncleanly; but a judge of faces would have read lit-\ntle hope for Birdy Edwards in those hard mouths\nand remorseless eyes. There was not a man in the\nroom whose hands had not been reddened a dozen\ntimes before. They were as hardened to human\nmurder as a butcher to sheep. Foremost, of course, both in appearance and in\nguilt, was the formidable Boss. Harraway, the sec-\nretary, was a lean, bitter man with a long, scraggy\nneck and nervous, jerky limbs, a man of incorrupt-\nible \ufb01delity where the \ufb01nances of the order were\nconcerned, and with no notion of justice or hon-\nesty to anyone beyond. The treasurer, Carter, was a\nmiddle-aged man, with an impassive, rather sulky\nexpression, and a yellow parchment skin. He was\na capable organizer, and the actual details of nearly\nevery outrage had sprung from his plotting brain. The two Willabys were men of action, tall, lithe\nyoung fellows with determined faces, while their\ncompanion, Tiger Cormac, a heavy, dark youth,\nwas feared even by his own comrades for the fe-\nrocity of his disposition. These were the men who\nassembled that night under the roof of McMurdo\nfor the killing of the Pinkerton detective. Their host had placed whisky upon the table,\nand they had hastened to prime themselves for the\nwork before them. Baldwin and Cormac were al-\nready half-drunk, and the liquor had brought out\nall their ferocity. Cormac placed his hands on the\nstove for an instant\u2014it had been lighted, for the\nnights were still cold. \u201cThat will do,\u201d said he, with an oath. 734\nThe Valley Of Fear\n\u201cAy,\u201d said Baldwin, catching his meaning. \u201cIf\nhe is strapped to that, we will have the truth out\nof him.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have the truth out of him, never fear,\u201d\nsaid McMurdo. He had nerves of steel, this man;\nfor though the whole weight of the affair was on\nhim his manner was as cool and unconcerned as\never. The others marked it and applauded. \u201cYou are the one to handle him,\u201d said the Boss\napprovingly. \u201cNot a warning will he get till your\nhand is on his throat. It\u2019s a pity there are no shut-\nters to your windows.\u201d\nMcMurdo went from one to the other and drew\nthe curtains tighter. \u201cSure no one can spy upon us\nnow. It\u2019s close upon the hour.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he won\u2019t come. Maybe he\u2019ll get a sniff\nof danger,\u201d said the secretary. \u201cHe\u2019ll come, never fear,\u201d McMurdo answered. \u201cHe is as eager to come as you can be to see him."

Three loud\nknocks had sounded at the door. \u201cHush!\u201d McMurdo raised his hand in caution. An exulting glance went round the circle, and\nhands were laid upon hidden weapons. \u201cNot a sound, for your lives!\u201d McMurdo whis-\npered, as he went from the room, closing the door\ncarefully behind him. With strained ears the murderers waited. They\ncounted the steps of their comrade down the pas-\nsage. Then they heard him open the outer door. There were a few words as of greeting. Then they\nwere aware of a strange step inside and of an un-\nfamiliar voice. An instant later came the slam of\nthe door and the turning of the key in the lock. Their prey was safe within the trap. Tiger Cormac\nlaughed horribly, and Boss McGinty clapped his\ngreat hand across his mouth. \u201cBe quiet, you fool!\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ll be\nthe undoing of us yet!\u201d\nThere was a mutter of conversation from the\nnext room. It seemed interminable. Then the door\nopened, and McMurdo appeared, his \ufb01nger upon\nhis lip. He came to the end of the table and looked\nround at them. A subtle change had come over\nhim. His manner was as of one who has great\nwork to do. His face had set into granite \ufb01rmness. His eyes shone with a \ufb01erce excitement behind\nhis spectacles. He had become a visible leader of\nmen. They stared at him with eager interest; but\nhe said nothing. Still with the same singular gaze\nhe looked from man to man. \u201cWell!\u201d cried Boss McGinty at last. \u201cIs he here? Is Birdy Edwards here?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d McMurdo answered slowly. \u201cBirdy Ed-\nwards is here. I am Birdy Edwards!\u201d\nThere were ten seconds after that brief speech\nduring which the room might have been empty, so\nprofound was the silence. The hissing of a kettle\nupon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear. Seven white faces, all turned upward to this man\nwho dominated them, were set motionless with ut-\nter terror. Then, with a sudden shivering of glass,\na bristle of glistening ri\ufb02e barrels broke through\neach window, while the curtains were torn from\ntheir hangings. At the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a\nwounded bear and plunged for the half-opened\ndoor. A levelled revolver met him there with the\nstern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Mine Po-\nlice gleaming behind the sights. The Boss recoiled\nand fell back into his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re safer there, Councillor,\u201d said the man\nwhom they had known as McMurdo. \u201cAnd you,\nBaldwin, if you don\u2019t take your hand off your pis-\ntol, you\u2019ll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or\nby the Lord that made me\u2014There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this house, and\nyou can \ufb01gure it out for yourself what chance you\nhave.

I\u2019ll tell you this, that when I was put upon\nthis job I never believed there was such a society\nas yours. I thought it was paper talk, and that I\nwould prove it so. They told me it was to do with\nthe Freemen; so I went to Chicago and was made\none. Then I was surer than ever that it was just\npaper talk; for I found no harm in the society, but\na deal of good. \u201cStill, I had to carry out my job, and I came\nto the coal valleys. When I reached this place I\nlearned that I was wrong and that it wasn\u2019t a dime\nnovel after all. So I stayed to look after it. I never\nkilled a man in Chicago. I never minted a dollar\nin my life. Those I gave you were as good as any\nothers; but I never spent money better. But I knew\nthe way into your good wishes and so I pretended\nto you that the law was after me.

They can say what they like, so\nlong as I get you. But what is the truth? The night\nI joined you beat up old man Stanger. I could not\nwarn him, for there was no time; but I held your\nhand, Baldwin, when you would have killed him. If ever I have suggested things, so as to keep my\nplace among you, they were things which I knew I\ncould prevent. I could not save Dunn and Men-\nzies, for I did not know enough; but I will see\nthat their murderers are hanged."

Fifty-odd\nhad various degrees of imprisonment. The work\nof Birdy Edwards was complete. And yet, as he had guessed, the game was not\nover yet. There was another hand to be played,\nand yet another and another. Ted Baldwin, for\none, had escaped the scaffold; so had the Will-\nabys; so had several others of the \ufb01ercest spirits\nof the gang. For ten years they were out of the\nworld, and then came a day when they were free\nonce more\u2014a day which Edwards, who knew his\nmen, was very sure would be an end of his life of\npeace. They had sworn an oath on all that they\nthought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for\ntheir comrades. And well they strove to keep their\nvow! From Chicago he was chased, after two at-\ntempts so near success that it was sure that the\nthird would get him. From Chicago he went un-\nder a changed name to California, and it was there\n736\nThe Valley Of Fear\nthat the light went for a time out of his life when\nEttie Edwards died. Once again he was nearly\nkilled, and once again under the name of Dou-\nglas he worked in a lonely canyon, where with an\nEnglish partner named Barker he amassed a for-\ntune.

CHAPTER VIII. Epilogue\nThe police trial had passed, in which the case\nof John Douglas was referred to a higher court. So\nhad the Quarter Sessions, at which he was acquit-\nted as having acted in self-defense. \u201cGet him out of England at any cost,\u201d wrote\nHolmes to the wife. \u201cThere are forces here which\nmay be more dangerous than those he has escaped.

I laughed at the quaint\nmessage; but Holmes showed unwonted serious-\nness. \u201cDeviltry, Watson!\u201d he remarked, and sat long\nwith a clouded brow. Late last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady,\nbrought up a message that a gentleman wished to\nsee Holmes, and that the matter was of the utmost\nimportance.

It came like that, did it?\u201d said Holmes,\nthoughtfully. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve no doubt it was well\nstage-managed.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that you think there was no acci-\ndent?\u201d\n\u201cNone in the world.\u201d\n\u201cHe was murdered?\u201d\n\u201cSurely!\u201d\n\u201cSo I think also. These infernal Scowrers, this\ncursed vindictive nest of criminals\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, my good sir,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThere is\na master hand here. It is no case of sawed-off shot-\nguns and clumsy six-shooters. You can tell an old\nmaster by the sweep of his brush. I can tell a Mo-\nriarty when I see one. This crime is from London,\nnot from America.\u201d\n\u201cBut for what motive?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it is done by a man who cannot af-\nford to fail\u2014one whose whole unique position de-\npends upon the fact that all he does must succeed. A great brain and a huge organization have been\nturned to the extinction of one man. It is crushing\nthe nut with the hammer\u2014an absurd extravagance\nof energy\u2014but the nut is very effectually crushed\nall the same.\u201d\n\u201cHow came this man to have anything to do\nwith it?\u201d\n737\n\u201cI can only say that the \ufb01rst word that ever\ncame to us of the business was from one of his lieu-\ntenants. These Americans were well advised. Hav-\ning an English job to do, they took into partner-\nship, as any foreign criminal could do, this great\nconsultant in crime. From that moment their man\nwas doomed. At \ufb01rst he would content himself by\nusing his machinery in order to \ufb01nd their victim. Then he would indicate how the matter might be\ntreated. Finally, when he read in the reports of\nthe failure of this agent, he would step in himself\nwith a master touch. You heard me warn this man\nat Birlstone Manor House that the coming danger\nwas greater than the past. Was I right?\u201d\nBarker beat his head with his clenched \ufb01st in\nhis impotent anger. \u201cDo you tell me that we have to sit down un-\nder this? Do you say that no one can ever get level\nwith this king-devil?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t say that,\u201d said Holmes, and his\neyes seemed to be looking far into the future. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t say that he can\u2019t be beat. But you must give\nme time\u2014you must give me time!\u201d\nWe all sat in silence for some minutes, while\nthose fateful eyes still strained to pierce the veil."

He has, for many years,\nlived in a a small farm upon the downs \ufb01ve miles from Eastbourne, where his time is di-\nvided between philosophy and agriculture. During this period of rest he has refused the\nmost princely offers to take up various cases, having determined that his retirement was a\npermanent one. The approach of the German war caused him, however, to lay his remarkable\ncombination of intellectual and practical activity at the disposal of the government, with his-\ntorical results which are recounted in His Last Bow. Several previous experiences which have\nlain long in my portfolio have been added to His Last Bow so as to complete the volume. John H. Watson, M.

The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles\nI\nfind it recorded in my notebook that it\nwas a bleak and windy day towards the\nend of March in the year 1892. Holmes\nhad received a telegram while we sat\nat our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He\nmade no remark, but the matter remained in his\nthoughts, for he stood in front of the \ufb01re after-\nwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his pipe,\nand casting an occasional glance at the message. Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous\ntwinkle in his eyes. \u201cI suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as\na man of letters,\u201d said he. \u201cHow do you de\ufb01ne the\nword \u2018grotesque\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cStrange\u2014remarkable,\u201d I suggested. He shook his head at my de\ufb01nition. \u201cThere is surely something more than that,\u201d\nsaid he; \u201csome underlying suggestion of the tragic\nand the terrible. If you cast your mind back to\nsome of those narratives with which you have af-\n\ufb02icted a long-suffering public, you will recognize\nhow often the grotesque has deepened into the\ncriminal. Think of that little affair of the red-\nheaded men. That was grotesque enough in the\noutset, and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at\nrobbery. Or, again, there was that most grotesque\naffair of the \ufb01ve orange pips, which let straight to\na murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the\nalert.\u201d\n\u201cHave you it there?\u201d I asked. He read the telegram aloud. \u201cHave just had most incredible and\ngrotesque experience."

No woman would ever\nsend a reply-paid telegram. She would have\ncome.\u201d\n\u201cWill you see him?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Watson, you know how bored I have\nbeen since we locked up Colonel Carruthers. My\nmind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces\nbecause it is not connected up with the work for\nwhich it was built. Life is commonplace, the pa-\npers are sterile; audacity and romance seem to\nhave passed forever from the criminal world. Can\nyou ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into\nany new problem, however trivial it may prove? But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.\u201d\nA measured step was heard upon the stairs,\nand a moment later a stout, tall, gray-whiskered\nand solemnly respectable person was ushered into\nthe room. His life history was written in his heavy\nfeatures and pompous manner. From his spats to\nhis gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative,\na churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and con-\nventional to the last degree. But some amazing ex-\nperience had disturbed his native composure and\nleft its traces in his bristling hair, his \ufb02ushed, an-\ngry cheeks, and his \ufb02urried, excited manner. He\nplunged instantly into his business. \u201cI have had a most singular and unpleasant ex-\nperience, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he. \u201cNever in my life\nhave I been placed in such a situation. It is most\nimproper\u2014most outrageous. I must insist upon\nsome explanation.\u201d He swelled and puffed in his\nanger. \u201cPray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,\u201d said Holmes\nin a soothing voice. \u201cMay I ask, in the \ufb01rst place,\nwhy you came to me at all?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, it did not appear to be a matter\nwhich concerned the police, and yet, when you\nhave heard the facts, you must admit that I could\nnot leave it where it was. Private detectives are a\nclass with whom I have absolutely no sympathy,\nbut none the less, having heard your name\u2014\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. But, in the second place, why did\nyou not come at once?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nHolmes glanced at his watch. \u201cIt is a quarter-past two,\u201d he said. \u201cYour tele-\ngram was dispatched about one. But no one can\nglance at your toilet and attire without seeing that\nyour disturbance dates from the moment of your\nwaking.\u201d\nOur client smoothed down his unbrushed hair\nand felt his unshaven chin. \u201cYou are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a\nthought to my toilet. I was only too glad to get out\nof such a house. But I have been running round\nmaking inquiries before I came to you. I went to\nthe house agents, you know, and they said that Mr.\nGarcia\u2019s rent was paid up all right and that every-\nthing was in order at Wisteria Lodge.\u201d\n\u201cCome, come, sir,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cYou are like my friend, Dr. Watson, who has a\n747\nThe Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\nbad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost."

What do you\nwant?\u201d\n\u201cWe wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to\nthe events which let up to the death last night of\nMr. Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near Es-\nher.\u201d\nOur client had sat up with staring eyes and ev-\nery tinge of colour struck from his astonished face. \u201cDead?

Now, sir, I sug-\ngest that you take no notice of this addition to your\naudience, and that you proceed with your narra-\ntive exactly as you would have done had you never\nbeen interrupted.\u201d\nOur visitor had gulped off the brandy and the\ncolour had returned to his face.

Among these are the family of a retired\nbrewer called Melville, living at Abermarle Man-\nsion, Kensington. It was at his table that I met\nsome weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia. He\nwas, I understood, of Spanish descent and con-\nnected in some way with the embassy. He spoke\nperfect English, was pleasing in his manners, and\nas good-looking a man as ever I saw in my life. \u201cIn some way we struck up quite a friendship,\nthis young fellow and I. He seemed to take a fancy\nto me from the \ufb01rst, and within two days of our\nmeeting he came to see me at Lee. One thing led\nto another, and it ended in his inviting me out to\nspend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge,\nbetween Esher and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I\nwent to Esher to ful\ufb01l this engagement. \u201cHe had described his household to me before\nI went there. He lived with a faithful servant, a\ncountryman of his own, who looked after all his\nneeds. This fellow could speak English and did\nhis housekeeping for him. Then there was a won-\nderful cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had\npicked up in his travels, who could serve an ex-\ncellent dinner. I remember that he remarked what\na queer household it was to \ufb01nd in the heart of\nSurrey, and that I agreed with him, though it has\nproved a good deal queerer than I thought. \u201cI drove to the place\u2014about two miles on the\nsouth side of Esher. The house was a fair-sized\none, standing back from the road, with a curv-\ning drive which was banked with high evergreen\nshrubs. It was an old, tumbledown building in a\ncrazy state of disrepair. When the trap pulled up\n748\nThe Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\non the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched\nand weather-stained door, I had doubts as to my\nwisdom in visiting a man whom I knew so slightly. He opened the door himself, however, and greeted\nme with a great show of cordiality. I was handed\nover to the manservant, a melancholy, swarthy in-\ndividual, who led the way, my bag in his hand,\nto my bedroom. The whole place was depress-\ning. Our dinner was t\u02c6ete-`a-t\u02c6ete, and though my\nhost did his best to be entertaining, his thoughts\nseemed to continually wander, and he talked so\nvaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand\nhim. He continually drummed his \ufb01ngers on the\ntable, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of\nnervous impatience. The dinner itself was neither\nwell served nor well cooked, and the gloomy pres-\nence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven\nus. I can assure you that many times in the course\nof the evening I wished that I could invent some\nexcuse which would take me back to Lee."

Near the end of dinner a note was\nhanded in by the servant. I noticed that after my\nhost had read it he seemed even more distrait and\nstrange than before. He gave up all pretence at\nconversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes,\nlost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark\nas to the contents. About eleven I was glad to go\nto bed. Some time later Garcia looked in at my\ndoor\u2014the room was dark at the time\u2014and asked\nme if I had rung. I said that I had not. He apolo-\ngized for having disturbed me so late, saying that\nit was nearly one o\u2019clock. I dropped off after this\nand slept soundly all night. \u201cAnd now I come to the amazing part of my\ntale. When I woke it was broad daylight. I glanced\nat my watch, and the time was nearly nine. I\nhad particularly asked to be called at eight, so I\nwas very much astonished at this forgetfulness. I\nsprang up and rang for the servant. There was no\nresponse. I rang again and again, with the same\nresult. Then I came to the conclusion that the bell\nwas out of order. I huddled on my clothes and\nhurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper\nto order some hot water. You can imagine my sur-\nprise when I found that there was no one there. I\nshouted in the hall. There was no answer. Then\nI ran from room to room. All were deserted. My\nhost had shown me which was his bedroom the\nnight before, so I knocked at the door. No reply. I\nturned the handle and walked in. The room was\nempty, and the bed had never been slept in. He\nhad gone with the rest. The foreign host, the for-\neign footman, the foreign cook, all had vanished in\nthe night! That was the end of my visit to Wisteria\nLodge.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and\nchuckling as he added this bizarre incident to his\ncollection of strange episodes. \u201cYour experience is, so far as I know, perfectly\nunique,\u201d said he. \u201cMay I ask, sir, what you did\nthen?\u201d\n\u201cI was furious. My \ufb01rst idea was that I had\nbeen the victim of some absurd practical joke. I\npacked my things, banged the hall door behind\nme, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at Allan Brothers\u2019, the chief land agents in\nthe village, and found that it was from this \ufb01rm\nthat the villa had been rented. It struck me that\nthe whole proceeding could hardly be for the pur-\npose of making a fool of me, and that the main\nobjet must be to get out of the rent. It is late in\nMarch, so quarter-day is at hand."

Finally when I got your reply to my wire I\ncame out to you, since I gather that you are a per-\nson who gives advice in dif\ufb01cult cases. But now,\nMr. Inspector, I understand, from what you said\nwhen you entered the room, that you can carry\nthe story on, and that some tragedy had occurred.

It\u2019s my way. Shall I read it,\nMr. Gregson?\u201d\nThe Londoner nodded. \u201cThe note is written upon ordinary cream-laid\npaper without watermark. It is a quarter-sheet. The paper is cut off in two snips with a short-\nbladed scissors. It has been folded over three times\nand sealed with purple wax, put on hurriedly and\npressed down with some \ufb02at oval object. It is ad-\ndressed to Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:\n\u201cOur own colours, green and white. Green open, white shut. Main stair,\n\ufb01rst\ncorridor,\nseventh\nright,\ngreen\nbaize.

How\ndo I come to be mixed up with the case?\u201d\n\u201cVery simply, sir,\u201d Inspector Baynes answered. \u201cThe only document found in the pocket of the\ndeceased was a letter from you saying that you\nwould be with him on the night of his death. It was\nthe envelope of this letter which gave us the dead\nman\u2019s name and address. It was after nine this\nmorning when we reached his house and found\nneither you nor anyone else inside it. I wired to\nMr. Gregson to run you down in London while I\nexamined Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town,\njoined Mr. Gregson, and here we are.\u201d\n\u201cI think now,\u201d said Gregson, rising, \u201cwe had\nbest put this matter into an of\ufb01cial shape.

Holmes smoked hard, with his\nbrowns drawn down over his keen eyes, and his\nhead thrust forward in the eager way characteris-\ntic of the man. \u201cWell, Watson,\u201d he asked, turning suddenly\nupon me, \u201cwhat do you make of it?\u201d\n\u201cI can make nothing of this mysti\ufb01cation of\nScott Eccles.\u201d\n\u201cBut the crime?\u201d\n\u201cWell, taken with the disappearance of the\nman\u2019s companions, I should say that they were in\nsome way concerned in the murder and had \ufb02ed\nfrom justice.\u201d\n\u201cThat is certainly a possible point of view. On\nthe face of it you must admit, however, that it\nis very strange that his two servants should have\nbeen in a conspiracy against him and should have\nattacked him on the one night when he had a\nguest. They had him alone at their mercy every\nother night in the week.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did they \ufb02y?\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. Why did they \ufb02y? There is a big\nfact. Another big fact is the remarkable experience\nof our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear Watson, is\nit beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish\nan explanation which would cover both of these\nbig facts? If it were one which would also ad-\nmit of the mysterious note with its very curious\nphraseology, why, then it would be worth accept-\ning as a temporary hypothesis. If the fresh facts\nwhich come to our knowledge all \ufb01t themselves\ninto the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradu-\nally become a solution.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is our hypothesis?\u201d\nHolmes leaned back in his chair with half-\nclosed eyes."

There were grave\nevents afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coax-\ning of Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some\nconnection with them.\u201d\n\u201cBut what possible connection?\u201d\n\u201cLet us take it link by link. There is, on the face\nof it, something unnatural about this strange and\nsudden friendship between the young Spaniard\nand Scott Eccles. It was the former who forced\nthe pace. He called upon Eccles at the other end\nof London on the very day after he \ufb01rst met him,\nand he kept in close touch with him until he got\nhim down to Esher. Now, what did he want with\nEccles? What could Eccles supply? I see no charm\nin the man. He is not particulary intelligent\u2014not a\nman likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin. Why, then, was he picked out from all the other\npeople whom Garcia met as particularly suited to\nhis purpose? Has he any one outstanding quality? I say that he has. He is the very type of conven-\ntional British respectability, and the very man as a\nwitness to impress another Briton. You saw your-\nself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of ques-\ntioning his statement, extraordinary as it was.\u201d\n\u201cBut what was he to witness?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, as things turned out, but everything\nhad they gone another way. That is how I read the\nmatter.\u201d\n\u201cI see, he might have proved an alibi.\u201d\n\u201cExactly, my dear Watson;\nhe might have\nproved an alibi. We will suppose, for argument\u2019s\nsake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge are con-\nfederates in some design. The attempt, whatever\nit may be, is to come off, we will say, before one\no\u2019clock. By some juggling of the clocks it is quite\npossible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed\nearlier than he thought, but in any case it is likely\nthat when Garcia went out of his way to tell him\nthat it was one it was really not more than twelve. If Garcia could do whatever he had to do and be\nback by the hour mentioned he had evidently a\npowerful reply to any accusation. Here was this\nirreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any\ncourt of law that the accused was in the house all\nthe time. It was an insurance against the worst.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, I see that. But how about the disap-\npearance of the others?\u201d\n\u201cI have not all my facts yet, but I do not think\nthere are any insuperable dif\ufb01culties. Still, it is\nan error to argue in front of your data. You \ufb01nd\n751\nThe Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\nyourself insensibly twisting them round to \ufb01t your\ntheories.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the message?\u201d\n\u201cHow did it run? \u2018Our own colours, green and\nwhite.\u2019\nSounds like racing. \u2018Green open, white\nshut.\u2019 That is clearly a signal. \u2018Main stair, \ufb01rst cor-\nridor, seventh right, green baize.\u2019 This is an assig-\nnation."

Holmes\nread it and was about to place it in his notebook\nwhen he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He tossed it across with a laugh. \u201cWe are moving in exalted circles,\u201d said he. The telegram was a list of names and ad-\ndresses:\nLord Harringby, The Dingle; Sir George\nFfolliott, Oxshott Towers; Mr. Hynes\nHynes, J.P., Purdley Place; Mr. James\nBaker Williams, Forton Old Hall; Mr.\nHenderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua\nStone, Nether Walsling. \u201cThis is a very obvious way of limiting our \ufb01eld\nof operations,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNo doubt Baynes,\nwith his methodical mind, has already adopted\nsome similar plan.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand.\u201d\n\u201cWell, my dear fellow, we have already arrived\nat the conclusion that the massage received by Gar-\ncia at dinner was an appointment or an assigna-\ntion. Now, if the obvious reading of it is correct,\nand in order to keep the tryst one has to ascend a\nmain stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor,\nit is perfectly clear that the house is a very large\none. It is equally certain that this house cannot\nbe more than a mile or two from Oxshott, since\nGarcia was walking in that direction and hoped,\naccording to my reading of the facts, to be back in\nWisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi,\nwhich would only be valid up to one o\u2019clock. As\nthe number of large houses close to Oxshott must\nbe limited, I adopted the obvious method of send-\ning to the agents mentioned by Scott Eccles and\nobtaining a list of them. Here they are in this tele-\ngram, and the other end of our tangled skein must\nlie among them.\u201d\nIt was nearly six o\u2019clock before we found our-\nselves in the pretty Surrey village of Esher, with\nInspector Baynes as our companion. Holmes and I had taken things for the night,\nand found comfortable quarters at the Bull. Finally\nwe set out in the company of the detective on our\nvisit to Wisteria Lodge. It was a cold, dark March\nevening, with a sharp wind and a \ufb01ne rain beating\nupon our faces, a \ufb01t setting for the wild common\nover which our road passed and the tragic goal to\nwhich it led us."

The\ncurved and shadowed drive led us to a low, dark\nhouse, pitch-black against a slate-coloured sky. From the front window upon the left of the door\nthere peeped a glimmer of a feeble light. \u201cThere\u2019s\na\nconstable\nin\npossession,\u201d\nsaid\nBaynes. \u201cI\u2019ll knock at the window.\u201d He stepped\nacross the grass plot and tapped with his hand\non the pane. Through the fogged glass I dimly\nsaw a man spring up from a chair beside the \ufb01re,\nand heard a sharp cry from within the room. An\ninstant later a white-faced, hard-breathing police-\n752\nThe Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\nman had opened the door, the candle wavering in\nhis trembling hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Walters?\u201d asked Baynes\nsharply. The man mopped his forehead with his hand-\nkerchief and agave a long sigh of relief. \u201cI am glad you have come, sir. It has been\na long evening, and I don\u2019t think my nerve is as\ngood as it was.\u201d\n\u201cYour nerve, Walters? I should not have\nthought you had a nerve in your body.\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, it\u2019s this lonely, silent house and the\nqueer thing in the kitchen. Then when you tapped\nat the window I thought it had come again.\u201d\n\u201cThat what had come again?\u201d\n\u201cThe devil, sir, for all I know. It was at the win-\ndow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was at the window, and when?\u201d\n\u201cIt was just about two hours ago. The light\nwas just fading. I was sitting reading in the chair. I don\u2019t know what made me look up, but there\nwas a face looking in at me through the lower\npane. Lord, sir, what a face it was! I\u2019ll see it in\nmy dreams.\u201d\n\u201cTut, tut, Walters. This is not talk for a police-\nconstable.\u201d\n\u201cI know, sir, I know; but it shook me, sir, and\nthere\u2019s no use to deny it. It wasn\u2019t black, sir, nor\nwas it white, nor any colour that I know but a\nkind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk\nin it. Then there was the size of it\u2014it was twice\nyours, sir. And the look of it\u2014the great staring\ngoggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a hun-\ngry beast. I tell you, sir, I couldn\u2019t move a \ufb01nger,\nnor get my breath, till it whisked away and was\ngone. Out I ran and through the shrubbery, but\nthank God there was no one there.\u201d\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you were a good man, Wal-\nters, I should put a black mark against you for this. If it were the devil himself a constable on duty\nshould never thank God that he could not lay his\nhands upon him.

Now, Mr. Holmes, with your permission,\nI will show you round the house.\u201d\nThe various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had\nyielded nothing to a careful search. Apparently\nthe tenants had brought little or nothing with\nthem, and all the furniture down to the smallest\ndetails had been taken over with the house. A\ngood deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and\nCo., High Holborn, had been left behind. Tele-\ngraphic inquiries had been already made which\nshowed that Marx knew nothing of his customer\nsave that he was a good payer.

The\ntable was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty\nplates, the debris of last night\u2019s dinner. \u201cLook at this,\u201d said Baynes. \u201cWhat do you\nmake of it?\u201d\nHe held up his candle before an extraordinary\nobject which stood at the back of the dresser. It\nwas so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that\nit was dif\ufb01cult to say what it might have been. One\ncould but say that it was black and leathery and\nthat it bore some resemblance to a dwar\ufb01sh, hu-\nman \ufb01gure. At \ufb01rst, as I examined it, I thought\nthat it was a mummi\ufb01ed negro baby, and then it\nseemed a very twisted and ancient monkey. Fi-\nnally I was left in doubt as to whether it was ani-\nmal or human. A double band of white shells were\nstrung round the centre of it. \u201cVery interesting\u2014very interesting, indeed!\u201d\nsaid Holmes, peering at this sinister relic. \u201cAny-\nthing more?\u201d\nIn silence Baynes led the way to the sink and\nheld forward his candle. The limbs and body of\nsome large, white bird, torn savagely to pieces\nwith the feathers still on, were littered all over it. Holmes pointed to the wattles on the severed head. \u201cA white cock,\u201d said he. \u201cMost interesting! It\nis really a very curious case.\u201d\nBut Mr. Baynes had kept his most sinister ex-\nhibit to the last. From under the sink he drew\na zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood."

It will be remembered that\nMr. Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, was found\ndead on Oxshott Common, his body show-\ning signs of extreme violence, and that on\nthe same night his servant and his cook\n\ufb02ed, which appeared to show their partic-\nipation in the crime.

It indicates a confederate at the other\nend. Now, where was the other end? I have al-\nready shown you that it could only lie in some\nlarge house, and that the number of large houses is\nlimited. My \ufb01rst days in this village were devoted\nto a series of walks in which in the intervals of my\nbotanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all\nthe large houses and an examination of the family\nhistory of the occupants. One house, and only one,\nriveted my attention. It is the famous old Jacobean\ngrange of High Gable, one mile on the farther side\nof Oxshott, and less than half a mile from the scene\nof the tragedy. The other mansions belonged to\nprosaic and respectable people who live far aloof\nfrom romance. But Mr. Henderson, of High Gable,\nwas by all accounts a curious man to whom cu-\nrious adventures might befall. I concentrated my\nattention, therefore, upon him and his household. \u201cA singular set of people, Watson\u2014the man\nhimself the most singular of them all. I managed\nto see him on a plausible pretext, but I seemed to\nread in his dark, deepset, brooding eyes that he\nwas perfectly aware of my true business."

He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the\ntropics, for he is yellow and sapless, but tough\nas whipcord. His friend and secretary, Mr. Lu-\ncas, is undoubtedly a foreigner, chocolate brown,\nwily, suave, and catlike, with a poisonous gentle-\nness of speech. You see, Watson, we have come\nalready upon two sets of foreigners\u2014one at Wiste-\nria Lodge and one at High Gable\u2014so our gaps are\nbeginning to close. \u201cThese two men, close and con\ufb01dential friends,\nare the centre of the household; but there is one\nother person who for our immediate purpose may\nbe even more important. Henderson has two chil-\ndren\u2014girls of eleven and thirteen. Their governess\nis a Miss Burnet, an Englishwoman of forty or\nthereabouts. There is also one con\ufb01dential manser-\nvant. This little group forms the real family, for\ntheir travel about together, and Henderson is a\ngreat traveller, always on the move. It is only\nwithin the last weeks that he has returned, after\na year\u2019s absence, to High Gable. I may add that\nhe is enormously rich, and whatever his whims\nmay be he can very easily satisfy them. For the\nrest, his house is full of butlers, footmen, maidser-\nvants, and the usual overfed, underworked staff of\na large English country house. \u201cSo much I learned partly from village gossip\nand partly from my own observation. There are no\nbetter instruments than discharged servants with a\ngrievance, and I was lucky enough to \ufb01nd one. I\ncall it luck, but it would not have come my way\nhad I not been looking out for it. As Baynes re-\nmarks, we all have our systems. It was my sys-\ntem which enabled me to \ufb01nd John Warner, late\ngardener of High Gable, sacked in a moment of\ntemper by his imperious employer. He in turn had\nfriends among the indoor servants who unite in\ntheir fear and dislike of their master. So I had my\nkey to the secrets of the establishment. \u201cCurious people, Watson! I don\u2019t pretend to\nunderstand it all yet, but very curious people any-\nway. It\u2019s a double-winged house, and the servants\nlive on one side, the family on the other. There\u2019s\nno link between the two save for Henderson\u2019s own\nservant, who serves the family\u2019s meals. Everything\nis carried to a certain door, which forms the one\nconnection. Governess and children hardly go out\nat all, except into the garden. Henderson never by\nany chance walks alone. His dark secretary is like\nhis shadow. The gossip among the servants is that\ntheir master is terribly afraid of something. \u2018Sold\nhis soul to the devil in exchange for money,\u2019 says\nWarner, \u2018and expects his creditor to come up and\nclaim his own.\u2019 Where they came from, or who\nthey are, nobody has an idea."

Twice Henderson has lashed at folk with\nhis dog-whip, and only his long purse and heavy\ncompensation have kept him out of the courts. \u201cWell, now, Watson, let us judge the situation\nby this new information. We may take it that the\nletter came out of this strange household and was\nan invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt\nwhich had already been planned. Who wrote the\nnote? It was someone within the citadel, and it\n756\nThe Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\nwas a woman. Who then but Miss Burnet, the gov-\nerness? All our reasoning seems to point that way. At any rate, we may take it as a hypothesis and\nsee what consequences it would entail. I may add\nthat Miss Burnet\u2019s age and character make it cer-\ntain that my \ufb01rst idea that there might be a love\ninterest in our story is out of the question. \u201cIf she wrote the note she was presumably the\nfriend and confederate of Garcia. What, then,\nmight she be expected to do if she heard of his\ndeath? If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her\nlips might be sealed. Still, in her heart, she must\nretain bitterness and hatred against those who had\nkilled him and would presumably help so far as\nshe could to have revenge upon them. Could we\nsee her, then and try to use her? That was my \ufb01rst\nthought. But now we come to a sinister fact. Miss\nBurnet has not been seen by any human eye since\nthe night of the murder. From that evening she has\nutterly vanished. Is she alive? Has she perhaps\nmet her end on the same night as the friend whom\nshe had summoned? Or is she merely a prisoner? There is the point which we still have to decide. \u201cYou will appreciate the dif\ufb01culty of the situ-\nation, Watson. There is nothing upon which we\ncan apply for a warrant. Our whole scheme might\nseem fantastic if laid before a magistrate. The\nwoman\u2019s disappearance counts for nothing, since\nin that extraordinary household any member of it\nmight be invisible for a week. And yet she may at\nthe present moment be in danger of her life. All I\ncan do is to watch the house and leave my agent,\nWarner, on guard at the gates. We can\u2019t let such\na situation continue. If the law can do nothing we\nmust take the risk ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d\n\u201cI know which is her room. It is accessible from\nthe top of an outhouse. My suggestion is that you\nand I go to-night and see if we can strike at the\nvery heart of the mystery.\u201d\nIt was not, I must confess, a very alluring\nprospect. The old house with its atmosphere of\nmurder, the singular and formidable inhabitants,\nthe unknown dangers of the approach, and the fact\nthat we were putting ourselves legally in a false\nposition all combined to damp my ardour."

But it was not destined that our investigation\nshould have so adventurous an ending. It was\nabout \ufb01ve o\u2019clock, and the shadows of the March\nevening were beginning to fall, when an excited\nrustic rushed into our room. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone, Mr. Holmes.

Her head hung listlessly upon her breast,\nbut as she raised it and turned her dull eyes upon\nus I saw that her pupils were dark dots in the cen-\ntre of the broad gray iris. She was drugged with\nopium. \u201cI watched at the gate, same as you advised,\nMr. Holmes,\u201d said our emissary, the discharged\ngardener. \u201cWhen the carriage came out I followed\nit to the station. She was like one walking in her\nsleep, but when they tried to get her into the train\nshe came to life and struggled. They pushed her\ninto the carriage. She fought her way out again. I\ntook her part, got her into a cab, and here we are. I shan\u2019t forget the face at the carriage window as\nI led her away. I\u2019d have a short life if he had his\nway\u2014the black-eyed, scowling, yellow devil.\u201d\nWe carried her upstairs, laid her on the sofa,\nand a couple of cups of the strongest coffee soon\ncleared her brain from the mists of the drug.

You were after Henderson?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, Mr. Holmes, when you were crawling in\nthe shrubbery at High Gable I was up one of the\ntrees in the plantation and saw you down below. It was just who would get his evidence \ufb01rst.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you arrest the mulatto?\u201d\nBaynes chuckled. \u201cI was sure Henderson, as he calls himself, felt\nthat he was suspected, and that he would lie low\nand make no move so long as he thought he was\nin any danger. I arrested the wrong man to make\nhim believe that our eyes were off him.

The whole history\nof the man came back to me in a \ufb02ash. He had\nmade his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty\ntyrant that had ever governed any country with a\npretence to civilization. Strong, fearless, and en-\nergetic, he had suf\ufb01cient virtue to enable him to\nimpose his odious vices upon a cowering people\nfor ten or twelve years. His name was a terror\nthrough all Central America. At the end of that\ntime there was a universal rising against him. But\nhe was as cunning as he was cruel, and at the\n\ufb01rst whisper of coming trouble he had secretly\nconveyed his treasures aboard a ship which was\nmanned by devoted adherents. It was an empty\npalace which was stormed by the insurgents next\nday. The dictator, his two children, his secretary,\nand his wealth had all escaped them. From that\nmoment he had vanished from the world, and his\nidentity had been a frequent subject for comment\nin the European press. \u201cYes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,\u201d\nsaid Baynes. \u201cIf you look it up you will \ufb01nd that\nthe San Pedro colours are green and white, same\nas in the note, Mr. Holmes. Henderson he called\nhimself, but I traced him back, Paris and Rome\nand Madrid to Barcelona, where his ship came in\nin \u201986. They\u2019ve been looking for him all the time\nfor their revenge, but it is only now that they have\nbegun to \ufb01nd him out.\u201d\n\u201cThey discovered him a year ago,\u201d said Miss\nBurnet, who had sat up and was now intently fol-\nlowing the conversation. \u201cOnce already his life has\nbeen attempted, but some evil spirit shielded him. Now, again, it is the noble, chivalrous Garcia who\nhas fallen, while the monster goes safe. But an-\nother will come, and yet another, until some day\njustice will be done; that is as certain as the rise of\nto-morrow\u2019s sun.\u201d Her thin hands clenched, and\nher worn face blanched with the passion of her\nhatred. \u201cBut how come you into this matter, Miss Bur-\nnet?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cHow can an English lady\njoin in such a murderous affair?\u201d\n\u201cI join in it because there is no other way in the\nworld by which justice can be gained.

To us there is no \ufb01end in hell like Juan\nMurillo, and no peace in life while his victims still\ncry for vengeance.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d said Holmes, \u201che was as you say. I have heard that he was atrocious. But how are\nyou affected?\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you it all. This villain\u2019s policy was\nto murder, on one pretext or another, every man\nwho showed such promise that he might in time\ncome to be a dangerous rival. My husband\u2014yes,\nmy real name is Signora Victor Durando\u2014was the\nSan Pedro minister in London. He met me and\nmarried me there. A nobler man never lived upon\nearth. Unhappily, Murillo heard of his excellence,\nrecalled him on some pretext, and had him shot. With a premonition of his fate he had refused to\ntake me with him. His estates were con\ufb01scated,\nand I was left with a pittance and a broken heart. \u201cThen came the downfall of the tyrant. He\nescaped as you have just described. But the\nmany whose lives he had ruined, whose nearest\nand dearest had suffered torture and death at his\nhands, would not let the matter rest. They banded\nthemselves into a society which should never be\ndissolved until the work was done. It was my\npart after we had discovered in the transformed\nHenderson the fallen despot, to attach myself to\nhis household and keep the others in touch with\nhis movements. This I was able to do by secur-\ning the position of governess in his family. He lit-\ntle knew that the woman who faced him at every\nmeal was the woman whose husband he had hur-\nried at an hour\u2019s notice into eternity. I smiled on\nhim, did my duty to his children, and bided my\ntime. An attempt was made in Paris and failed. We zig-zagged swiftly here and there over Europe\nto throw off the pursuers and \ufb01nally returned to\nthis house, which he had taken upon his \ufb01rst ar-\nrival in England. \u201cBut here also the ministers of justice were\nwaiting. Knowing that he would return there, Gar-\ncia, who is the son of the former highest dignitary\nin San Pedro, was waiting with two trusty com-\npanions of humble station, all three \ufb01red with the\n758\nThe Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\nsame reasons for revenge. He could do little dur-\ning the day, for Murillo took every precaution and\nnever went out save with his satellite Lucas, or\nLopez as he was known in the days of his great-\nness. At night, however, he slept alone, and the\navenger might \ufb01nd him. On a certain evening,\nwhich had been prearranged, I sent my friend \ufb01nal\ninstructions, for the man was forever on the alert\nand continually changed his room. I was to see\nthat the doors were open and the signal of a green\nor white light in a window which faced the drive\nwas to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt\nhad better be postponed."

Then and\nthere they would have plunged their knives into\nme could they have seen how to escape the con-\nsequences of the deed. Finally, after much debate,\nthey concluded that my murder was too danger-\nous. But they determined to get rid forever of Gar-\ncia. They had gagged me, and Murillo twisted my\narm round until I gave him the address. I swear\nthat he might have twisted it off had I understood\nwhat it would mean to Garcia. Lopez addressed\nthe note which I had written, sealed it with his\nsleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant,\nJose. How they murdered him I do not know, save\nthat it was Murillo\u2019s hand who struck him down,\nfor Lopez had remained to guard me. I believe he\nmust have waited among the gorse bushes through\nwhich the path winds and struck him down as he\npassed. At \ufb01rst they were of a mind to let him\nenter the house and to kill him as a detected bur-\nglar; but they argued that if they were mixed up\nin an inquiry their own identity would at once be\npublicly disclosed and they would be open to fur-\nther attacks. With the death of Garcia, the pursuit\nmight cease, since such a death might frighten oth-\ners from the task. \u201cAll would now have been well for them had\nit not been for my knowledge of what they had\ndone. I have no doubt that there were times when\nmy life hung in the balance.

No, no, we shall all be\njusti\ufb01ed when we see the tenants of High Gable at\nthe next Guildford Assizes.\u201d\nIt is a matter of history, however, that a little\ntime was still to elapse before the Tiger of San Pe-\ndro should meet with his deserts. Wily and bold,\nhe and his companion threw their pursuer off their\ntrack by entering a lodging-house in Edmonton\nStreet and leaving by the back-gate into Curzon\nSquare. From that day they were seen no more\nin England. Some six months afterwards the Mar-\nquess of Montalva and Signor Rulli, his secretary,\nwere both murdered in their rooms at the Hotel\nEscurial at Madrid. The crime was ascribed to Ni-\nhilism, and the murderers were never arrested.

The man was a primitive sav-\nage from the backwoods of San Pedro, and this\nwas his fetish. When his companion and he had\n\ufb02ed to some prearranged retreat\u2014already occu-\npied, no doubt by a confederate\u2014the companion\nhad persuaded him to leave so compromising an\narticle of furniture. But the mulatto\u2019s heart was\nwith it, and he was driven back to it next day,\nwhen, on reconnoitering through the window, he\nfound policeman Walters in possession. He waited\nthree days longer, and then his piety or his su-\nperstition drove him to try once more."

Baker Street\nwas like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight\nupon the yellow brickwork of the house across the\nroad was painful to the eye. It was hard to believe\nthat these were the same walls which loomed so\ngloomily through the fogs of winter. Our blinds\nwere half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the\nsofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had\nreceived by the morning post. For myself, my term\nof service in India had trained me to stand heat\nbetter than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was\nno hardship. But the morning paper was uninter-\nesting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out\nof town, and I yearned for the glades of the New\nForest or the shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank\naccount had caused me to postpone my holiday,\nand as to my companion, neither the country nor\nthe sea presented the slightest attraction to him. He loved to lie in the very center of \ufb01ve millions\nof people, with his \ufb01laments stretching out and\nrunning through them, responsive to every little\nrumour or suspicion of unsolved crime."

So when I\nsaw you throw down your paper and enter upon a\ntrain of thought, I was very happy to have the op-\nportunity of reading it off, and eventually of break-\ning into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport\nwith you.\u201d\nBut I was still far from satis\ufb01ed. \u201cIn the exam-\nple which you read to me,\u201d said I, \u201cthe reasoner\ndrew his conclusions from the actions of the man\nwhom he observed. If I remember right, he stum-\nbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars,\nand so on. But I have been seated quietly in my\nchair, and what clues can I have given you?\u201d\n\u201cYou do yourself an injustice. The features\nare given to man as the means by which he shall\nexpress his emotions, and yours are faithful ser-\nvants.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean to say that you read my train of\nthoughts from my features?\u201d\n\u201cYour features and especially your eyes. Per-\nhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie\ncommenced?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I cannot.\u201d\n\u201cThen I will tell you. After throwing down\nyour paper, which was the action which drew my\nattention to you, you sat for half a minute with\na vacant expression. Then your eyes \ufb01xed them-\nselves upon your newly framed picture of General\nGordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face\nthat a train of thought had been started. But it\ndid not lead very far. Your eyes \ufb02ashed across\nto the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher\nwhich stands upon the top of your books. Then\nyou glanced up at the wall, and of course your\nmeaning was obvious."

But\nnow your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you\nlooked hard across as if you were studying the\ncharacter in his features. Then your eyes ceased\nto pucker, but you continued to look across, and\nyour face was thoughtful. You were recalling the\nincidents of Beecher\u2019s career.

You felt so strongly about it that\nI knew you could not think of Beecher without\nthinking of that also. When a moment later I saw\nyour eyes wander away from the picture, I sus-\npected that your mind had now turned to the Civil\nWar, and when I observed that your lips set, your\neyes sparkled, and your hands clenched I was pos-\nitive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry\nwhich was shown by both sides in that desperate\nstruggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder,\nyou shook your head. You were dwelling upon\nthe sadness and horror and useless waste of life.

I should not have intruded it upon your\nattention had you not shown some incredulity the\nother day. But I have in my hands here a little\nproblem which may prove to be more dif\ufb01cult of\nsolution than my small essay I thought reading. Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph\nreferring to the remarkable contents of a packet\nsent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross\nStreet, Croydon?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I saw nothing.\u201d\n\u201cAh! then you must have overlooked it. Just\ntoss it over to me. Here it is, under the \ufb01nancial\ncolumn. Perhaps you would be good enough to\nread it aloud.\u201d\nI picked up the paper which he had thrown\nback to me and read the paragraph indicated. It\nwas headed, \u201cA Gruesome Packet.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Susan Cushing, living at Cross\nStreet, Croydon, has been made the victim\nof what must be regarded as a peculiarly re-\nvolting practical joke unless some more sin-\nister meaning should prove to be attached to\nthe incident."

A card-\nboard box was inside, which was \ufb01lled with\ncoarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cush-\ning was horri\ufb01ed to \ufb01nd two human ears,\napparently quite freshly severed. The box\nhad been sent by parcel post from Belfast\nupon the morning before. There is no in-\ndication as to the sender, and the matter\nis the more mysterious as Miss Cushing,\nwho is a maiden lady of \ufb01fty, has led a most\nretired life, and has so few acquaintances\nor correspondents that it is a rare event for\nher to receive anything through the post. Some years ago, however, when she resided\nat Penge, she let apartments in her house\nto three young medical students, whom she\nwas obliged to get rid of on account of their\nnoisy and irregular habits. The police are\nof opinion that this outrage may have been\nperpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these\nyouths, who owed her a grudge and who\nhoped to frighten her by sending her these\nrelics of the dissecting-rooms. Some proba-\nbility is lent to the theory by the fact that\none of these students came from the north of\nIreland, and, to the best of Miss Cushing\u2019s\nbelief, from Belfast. In the meantime, the\nmatter is being actively investigated, Mr.\nLestrade, one of the very smartest of our de-\ntective of\ufb01cers, being in charge of the case.\u201d\n\u201cSo much for the Daily Chronicle,\u201d said Holmes as\nI \ufb01nished reading. \u201cNow for our friend Lestrade. I had a note from him this morning, in which he\nsays:\n\u201cI think that this case is very much in\nyour line. We have every hope of clear-\ning the matter up, but we \ufb01nd a little\ndif\ufb01culty in getting anything to work\nupon. We have, of course, wired to the\nBelfast post-of\ufb01ce, but a large number\nof parcels were handed in upon that\nday, and they have no means of identi-\nfying this particular one, or of remem-\nbering the sender. The box is a half-\npound box of honeydew tobacco and\ndoes not help us in any way. The medi-\ncal student theory still appears to me to\n764\nThe Adventure of the Cardboard Box\nbe the most feasible, but if you should\nhave a few hours to spare I should be\nvery happy to see you out here. I shall\nbe either at the house or in the police-\nstation all day. \u201cWhat say you, Watson? Can you rise superior\nto the heat and run down to Croydon with me on\nthe off chance of a case for your annals?\u201d\n\u201cI was longing for something to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou shall have it then. Ring for our boots and\ntell them to order a cab. I\u2019ll be back in a moment\nwhen I have changed my dressing-gown and \ufb01lled\nmy cigar-case.\u201d\nA shower of rain fell while we were in the train,\nand the heat was far less oppressive in Croydon\nthan in town."

A walk of\n\ufb01ve minutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss\nCushing resided. It was a very long street of two-story brick\nhouses, neat and prim, with whitened stone steps\nand little groups of aproned women gossiping at\nthe doors. Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and\ntapped at a door, which was opened by a small\nservant girl. Miss Cushing was sitting in the front\nroom, into which we were ushered. She was a\nplacid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes, and\ngrizzled hair curving down over her temples on\neach side. A worked antimacassar lay upon her\nlap and a basket of coloured silks stood upon a\nstool beside her. \u201cThey are in the outhouse, those dreadful\nthings,\u201d said she as Lestrade entered. \u201cI wish that\nyou would take them away altogether.\u201d\n\u201cSo I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them\nhere until my friend, Mr. Holmes, should have\nseen them in your presence.\u201d\n\u201cWhy in my presence, sir?\u201d\n\u201cIn case he wished to ask any questions.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the use of asking me questions when\nI tell you I know nothing whatever about it?\u201d\n\u201cQuite so, madam,\u201d said Holmes in his sooth-\ning way. \u201cI have no doubt that you have been an-\nnoyed more than enough already over this busi-\nness.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and\nlive a retired life. It is something new for me to\nsee my name in the papers and to \ufb01nd the police\nin my house. I won\u2019t have those things I here, Mr.\nLestrade. If you wish to see them you must go to\nthe outhouse.\u201d\nIt was a small shed in the narrow garden which\nran behind the house. Lestrade went in and\nbrought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece\nof brown paper and some string. There was a\nbench at the end of the path, and we all sat down\nwhile Homes examined one by one, the articles\nwhich Lestrade had handed to him. \u201cThe string is exceedingly interesting,\u201d he re-\nmarked, holding it up to the light and snif\ufb01ng at\nit. \u201cWhat do you make of this string, Lestrade?\u201d\n\u201cIt has been tarred.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely. It is a piece of tarred twine. You\nhave also, no doubt, remarked that Miss Cushing\nhas cut the cord with a scissors, as can be seen\nby the double fray on each side. This is of impor-\ntance.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot see the importance,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cThe importance lies in the fact that the knot is\nleft intact, and that this knot is of a peculiar char-\nacter.\u201d\n\u201cIt is very neatly tied. I had already made a\nnote of that effect,\u201d said Lestrade complacently. \u201cSo much for the string, then,\u201d said Holmes,\nsmiling, \u201cnow for the box wrapper. Brown paper,\nwith a distinct smell of coffee. What, did you not\nobserve it?"

Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon.\u2019 Done with a\nbroad-pointed pen, probably a J, and with very in-\nferior ink. The word \u2018Croydon\u2019 has been originally\nspelled with an \u2018i\u2019, which has been changed to\n\u2018y\u2019. The parcel was directed, then, by a man\u2014the\nprinting is distinctly masculine\u2014of limited educa-\ntion and unacquainted with the town of Croydon. So far, so good! The box is a yellow, half-pound\nhoneydew box, with nothing distinctive save two\nthumb marks at the left bottom corner. It is \ufb01lled\nwith rough salt of the quality used for preserv-\ning hides and other of the coarser commercial pur-\nposes. And embedded in it are these very singular\nenclosures.\u201d\nHe took out the two ears as he spoke, and lay-\ning a board across his knee he examined them\nminutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward\non each side of him, glanced alternately at these\ndreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of\nour companion. Finally he returned them to the\nbox once more and sat for a while in deep medita-\ntion. \u201cYou have observed, of course,\u201d said he at last,\n\u201cthat the ears are not a pair.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have noticed that. But if this were\nthe practical joke of some students from the\n765\nThe Adventure of the Cardboard Box\ndissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to\nsend two odd ears as a pair.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely. But this is not a practical joke.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure of it?\u201d\n\u201cThe presumption is strongly against it. Bodies\nin the dissecting-rooms are injected with preserva-\ntive \ufb02uid. These ears bear no signs of this. They\nare fresh, too. They have been cut off with a\nblunt instrument, which would hardly happen if\na student had done it. Again, carbolic or recti\ufb01ed\nspirits would be the preservatives which would\nsuggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly\nnot rough salt. I repeat that there is no practical\njoke here, but that we are investigating a serious\ncrime.\u201d\nA vague thrill ran through me as I listened to\nmy companion\u2019s words and saw the stern grav-\nity which had hardened his features. This bru-\ntal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some\nstrange and inexplicable horror in the background. Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who\nis only half convinced. \u201cThere are objections to the joke theory, no\ndoubt,\u201d said he, \u201cbut there are much stronger rea-\nsons against the other. We know that this woman\nhas led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge\nand here for the last twenty years. She has hardly\nbeen away from her home for a day during that\ntime. Why on earth, then, should any criminal\nsend her the proofs of his guilt, especially as, un-\nless she is a most consummate actress, she under-\nstands quite as little of the matter as we do?\u201d\n\u201cThat is the problem which we have to solve,\u201d\nHolmes answered, \u201cand for my part I shall set\nabout it by presuming that my reasoning is cor-\nrect, and that a double murder has been commit-\nted."

These two people are presumably\ndead, or we should have heard their story before\nnow. To-day is Friday. The packet was posted on\nThursday morning. The tragedy, then, occurred\non Wednesday or Tuesday, or earlier. If the two\npeople were murdered, who but their murderer\nwould have sent this sign of his work to Miss\nCushing? We may take it that the sender of the\npacket is the man whom we want. But he must\nhave some strong reason for sending Miss Cush-\ning this packet. What reason then? It must have\nbeen to tell her that the deed was done! or to\npain her, perhaps. But in that case she knows who\nit is. Does she know? I doubt it. If she knew,\nwhy should she call the police in? She might have\nburied the ears, and no one would have been the\nwiser. That is what she would have done if she\nhad wished to shield the criminal. But if she does\nnot wish to shield him she would give his name. There is a tangle here which needs straightening\nto.\u201d He had been talking in a high, quick voice,\nstaring blankly up over the garden fence, but now\nhe sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards\nthe house. \u201cI have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cIn that case I may leave you here,\u201d said\nLestrade, \u201cfor I have another small business on\nhand.

Surprise and satisfaction were\nboth for an instant to be read upon his eager face,\nthough when she glanced round to \ufb01nd out the\ncause of his silence he had become as demure as\never. I stared hard myself at her \ufb02at, grizzled hair,\nher trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid fea-\ntures; but I could see nothing which could account\nfor my companion\u2019s evident excitement."

Jim\ncame down here to see me once. That was be-\nfore he broke the pledge; but afterwards he would\nalways take drink when he was ashore, and a lit-\ntle drink would send him stark, staring mad.

First he dropped me, then he quar-\nrelled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped\nwriting we don\u2019t know how things are going with\nthem.\u201d\nIt was evident that Miss Cushing had come\nupon a subject on which she felt very deeply. Like\nmost people who lead a lonely life, she was shy\nat \ufb01rst, but ended by becoming extremely com-\nmunicative. She told us many details about her\nbrother-in-law the steward, and then wandering\noff on the subject of her former lodgers, the med-\nical students, she gave us a long account of their\ndelinquencies, with their names and those of their\nhospitals. Holmes listened attentively to every-\nthing, throwing in a question from time to time. \u201cAbout your second sister, Sarah,\u201d said he. \u201cI\nwonder, since you are both maiden ladies, that you\ndo not keep house together.\u201d\n\u201cAh! you don\u2019t know Sarah\u2019s temper or you\nwould wonder no more. I tried it when I came to\nCroydon, and we kept on until about two months\nago, when we had to part. I don\u2019t want to say a\nword against my own sister, but she was always\nmeddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that she quarrelled with your Liver-\npool relations.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and they were the best of friends at one\ntime.

That he may be safely trusted to\ndo, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason,\nhe is as tenacious as a bulldog when he once un-\nderstands what he has to do, and indeed, it is just\nthis tenacity which has brought him to the top at\nScotland Yard.\u201d\n\u201cYour case is not complete, then?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt is fairly complete in essentials. We know\nwho the author of the revolting business is, al-\nthough one of the victims still escapes us. Of\ncourse, you have formed your own conclusions.\u201d\n\u201cI presume that this Jim Browner, the steward\nof a Liverpool boat, is the man whom you sus-\npect?\u201d\n\u201cOh! it is more than a suspicion.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet I cannot see anything save very vague\nindications.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary, to my mind nothing could be\nmore clear. Let me run over the principal steps. We approached the case, you remember, with an\nabsolutely blank mind, which is always an advan-\ntage. We had formed no theories. We were sim-\nply there to observe and to draw inferences from\nour observations. What did we see \ufb01rst? A very\nplacid and respectable lady, who seemed quite in-\nnocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed\nme that she had two younger sisters. It instantly\n\ufb02ashed across my mind that the box might have\nbeen meant for one of these. I set the idea aside\nas one which could be disproved or con\ufb01rmed at\nour leisure."

        "text": "Then we went to the garden, as you\nremember, and we saw the very singular contents\nof the little yellow box. \u201cThe string was of the quality which is used\nby sail-makers aboard ship, and at once a whiff of\nthe sea was perceptible in our investigation. When\nI observed that the knot was one which is popu-\nlar with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at\na port, and that the male ear was pierced for an\nearring which is so much more common among\nsailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that all\nthe actors in the tragedy were to be found among\nour seafaring classes. \u201cWhen I came to examine the address of the\npacket I observed that it was to Miss S. Cushing. Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be Miss\nCushing, and although her initial was \u2018S\u2019 it might\nbelong to one of the others as well. In that case we\nshould have to commence our investigation from\na fresh basis altogether. I therefore went into the\nhouse with the intention of clearing up this point. I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was con-\nvinced that a mistake had been made when you\nmay remember that I came suddenly to a stop. The\nfact was that I had just seen something which \ufb01lled\nme with surprise and at the same time narrowed\nthe \ufb01eld of our inquiry immensely. \u201cAs a medical man, you are aware, Watson,\nthat there is no part of the body which varies so\nmuch as the human ear. Each ear is as a rule\nquite distinctive and differs from all other ones. In last year\u2019s Anthropological Journal you will \ufb01nd\ntwo short monographs from my pen upon the sub-\nject. I had, therefore, examined the ears in the\nbox with the eyes of an expert and had carefully\n768\nThe Adventure of the Cardboard Box\nnoted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my\nsurprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing\nI perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with\nthe female ear which I had just inspected. The mat-\nter was entirely beyond coincidence. There was\nthe same shortening of the pinna, the same broad\ncurve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of\nthe inner cartilage. In all essentials it was the same\near. \u201cIn the \ufb01rst place, her sister\u2019s name was Sarah,\nand her address had until recently been the same,\nso that it was quite obvious how the mistake had\noccurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard of this steward, married to the third\nsister, and learned that he had at one time been\nso intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually\ngone up to Liverpool to be near the Browners, but\na quarrel had afterwards divided them. This quar-\nrel had put a stop to all communications for some\nmonths, so that if Browner had occasion to ad-\ndress a packet to Miss Sarah, he would undoubt-\nedly have done so to her old address."

        "text": "\u201cAnd now the matter had begun to straighten\nitself out wonderfully. We had learned of the exis-\ntence of this steward, an impulsive man, of strong\npassions\u2014you remember that he threw up what\nmust have been a very superior berth in order\nto be nearer to his wife\u2014subject, too, to occa-\nsional \ufb01ts of hard drinking. We had reason to be-\nlieve that his wife had been murdered, and that\na man\u2014presumably a seafaring man\u2014had been\nmurdered at the same time. Jealousy, of course,\nat once suggests itself as the motive for the crime. And why should these proofs of the deed be sent\nto Miss Sarah Cushing? Probably because during\nher residence in Liverpool she had some hand in\nbringing about the events which led to the tragedy. You will observe that this line of boats call at\nBelfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presum-\ning that Browner had committed the deed and had\nembarked at once upon his steamer, the May Day,\nBelfast would be the \ufb01rst place at which he could\npost his terrible packet. \u201cA second solution was at this stage obviously\npossible, and although I thought it exceedingly\nunlikely, I was determined to elucidate it before\ngoing further. An unsuccessful lover might have\nkilled Mr. and Mrs. Browner, and the male ear\nmight have belonged to the husband. There were\nmany grave objections to this theory, but it was\nconceivable. I therefore sent off a telegram to my\nfriend Algar, of the Liverpool force, and asked him\nto \ufb01nd out if Mrs. Browner were at home, and if\nBrowner had departed in the May Day. Then we\nwent on to Wallington to visit Miss Sarah. \u201cI was curious, in the \ufb01rst place, to see how far\nthe family ear had been reproduced in her. Then,\nof course, she might give us very important infor-\nmation, but I was not sanguine that she would. She must have heard of the business the day be-\nfore, since all Croydon was ringing with it, and she\nalone could have understood for whom the packet\nwas meant. If she had been willing to help justice\nshe would probably have communicated with the\npolice already. However, it was clearly our duty to\nsee her, so we went. We found that the news of the\narrival of the packet\u2014for her illness dated from\nthat time\u2014had such an effect upon her as to bring\non brain fever. It was clearer than ever that she\nunderstood its full signi\ufb01cance, but equally clear\nthat we should have to wait some time for any as-\nsistance from her. \u201cHowever, we were really independent of her\nhelp. Our answers were waiting for us at the\npolice-station, where I had directed Algar to send\nthem. Nothing could be more conclusive. Mrs.\nBrowner\u2019s house had been closed for more than\nthree days, and the neighbours were of opinion\nthat she had gone south to see her relatives. It\nhad been ascertained at the shipping of\ufb01ces that\nBrowner had left aboard of the May Day, and I\ncalculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow\nnight."

Why, bless\nyou, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you often\nwould not see me for weeks on end.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt, sir; but this is different. It fright-\nens me, Mr. Holmes. I can\u2019t sleep for fright. To\nhear his quick step moving here and moving there\nfrom early morning to late at night, and yet never\nto catch so much as a glimpse of him\u2014it\u2019s more\nthan I can stand. My husband is as nervous over\nit as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while\nI get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What\nhas he done? Except for the girl, I am all alone in\nthe house with him, and it\u2019s more than my nerves\ncan stand.\u201d\nHolmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin\n\ufb01ngers upon the woman\u2019s shoulder. He had an al-\nmost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished. The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agi-\ntated features smoothed into their usual common-\nplace. She sat down in the chair which he had\nindicated. \u201cIf I take it up I must understand every detail,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cTake time to consider. The smallest point\nmay be the most essential. You say that the man\ncame ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight\u2019s\nboard and lodging?\u201d\n\u201cHe asked my terms, sir. I said \ufb01fty shillings a\nweek."

He took out a ten-pound note,\nand he held it out to me then and there. \u2018You can\nhave the same every fortnight for a long time to\ncome if you keep the terms,\u2019 he said. \u2018If not, I\u2019ll\nhave no more to do with you.\u2019\n\u201cWhat were the terms?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, they were that he was to have a key\nof the house. That was all right. Lodgers often\nhave them. Also, that he was to be left entirely\nto himself and never, upon any excuse, to be dis-\nturbed.\u201d\n\u201cNothing wonderful in that, surely?\u201d\n\u201cNot in reason, sir. But this is out of all reason. He has been there for ten days, and neither Mr.\nWarren, nor I, nor the girl has once set eyes upon\nhim. We can hear that quick step of his pacing\nup and down, up and down, night, morning, and\nnoon; but except on that \ufb01rst night he had never\nonce gone out of the house.\u201d\n\u201cOh, he went out the \ufb01rst night, did he?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, and returned very late\u2014after we were\nall in bed. He told me after he had taken the rooms\nthat he would do so and asked me not to bar the\ndoor. I heard him come up the stair after mid-\nnight.\u201d\n\u201cBut his meals?\u201d\n\u201cIt was his particular direction that we should\nalways, when he rang, leave his meal upon a chair,\noutside his door. Then he rings again when he has\n\ufb01nished, and we take it down from the same chair. If he wants anything else he prints it on a slip of\npaper and leaves it.\u201d\n\u201cPrints it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir; prints it in pencil. Just the word,\nnothing more. Here\u2019s the one I brought to show\nyou\u2014soap. Here\u2019s another\u2014match. This is one\nhe left the \ufb01rst morning\u2014daily gazette. I leave\nthat paper with his breakfast every morning.\u201d\n\u201cDear me, Watson,\u201d said Homes, staring with\ngreat curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the\n777\nThe Adventure of the Red Circle\nlandlady had handed to him, \u201cthis is certainly a\nlittle unusual. Seclusion I can understand; but\nwhy print? Printing is a clumsy process. Why not\nwrite? What would it suggest, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cThat he desired to conceal his handwriting.\u201d\n\u201cBut why? What can it matter to him that his\nlandlady should have a word of his writing? Still,\nit may be as you say. Then, again, why such la-\nconic messages?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\n\u201cIt opens a pleasing \ufb01eld for intelligent spec-\nulation. The words are written with a broad-\npointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual pat-\ntern. You will observe that the paper is torn away\nat the side here after the printing was done, so that\nthe \u2018s\u2019 of \u2018soap\u2019 is partly gone."

Do you say nothing has come out of that\nroom\u2014absolutely nothing?\u201d\nThe landlady drew an envelope from her bag;\nfrom it she shook out two burnt matches and a\ncigarette-end upon the table. \u201cThey were on his tray this morning.

That\nis obvious from the shortness of the burnt end. Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or\ncigar. But, dear me! this cigarette stub is cer-\ntainly remarkable. The gentleman was bearded\nand moustached, you say?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand that. I should say that only\na clean-shaven man could have smoked this. Why,\nWatson, even your modest moustache would have\nbeen singed.\u201d\n\u201cA holder?\u201d I suggested. \u201cNo, no; the end is matted. I suppose there\ncould not be two people in your rooms, Mrs. War-\nren?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir. He eats so little that I often wonder it\ncan keep life in one.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think we must wait for a little more\nmaterial. After all, you have nothing to complain\nof. You have received your rent, and he is not a\ntroublesome lodger, though he is certainly an un-\nusual one. He pays you well, and if he chooses\nto lie concealed it is no direct business of yours. We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his pri-\nvacy until we have some reason to think that there\nis a guilty reason for it. I\u2019ve taken up the matter,\nand I won\u2019t lose sight of it. Report to me if any-\nthing fresh occurs, and rely upon my assistance if\nit should be needed. \u201cThere are certainly some points of interest in\nthis case, Watson,\u201d he remarked when the land-\nlady had left us. \u201cIt may, of course, be triv-\nial\u2014individual eccentricity; or it may be very\nmuch deeper than appears on the surface. The \ufb01rst\nthing that strike one is the obvious possibility that\nthe person now in the rooms may be entirely dif-\nferent from the one who engaged them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should you think so?\u201d\n\u201cWell, apart form this cigarette-end, was it not\nsuggestive that the only time the lodger went out\nwas immediately after his taking the rooms?"

It was this\nmorning, sir. Mr. Warren is a timekeeper at Mor-\nton and Waylight\u2019s, in Tottenham Court Road. He\nhas to be out of the house before seven. Well, this\nmorning he had not gone ten paces down the road\nwhen two men came up behind him, threw a coat\nover his head, and bundled him into a cab that was\nbeside the curb. They drove him an hour, and then\nopened the door and shot him out. He lay in the\nroadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw\nwhat became of the cab. When he picked himself\nup he found he was on Hampstead Heath; so he\ntook a bus home, and there he lies now on his sofa,\nwhile I came straight round to tell you what had\nhappened.\u201d\n\u201cMost interesting,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cDid he ob-\nserve the appearance of these men\u2014did he hear\nthem talk?\u201d\n\u201cNo; he is clean dazed. He just knows that he\nwas lifted up as if by magic and dropped as if by\nmagic. Two a least were in it, and maybe three.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\nyou\nconnect\nthis\nattack\nwith\nyour\nlodger?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve lived there \ufb01fteen years and no\nsuch happenings ever came before. I\u2019ve had\nenough of him. Money\u2019s not everything. I\u2019ll have\nhim out of my house before the day is done.\u201d\n\u201cWait a bit, Mrs. Warren. Do nothing rash. I be-\ngin to think that this affair may be very much more\nimportant than appeared at \ufb01rst sight. It is clear\nnow that some danger is threatening your lodger. It is equally clear that his enemies, lying in wait\nfor him near your door, mistook your husband for\nhim in the foggy morning light. On discovering\ntheir mistake they released him. What they would\nhave done had it not been a mistake, we can only\nconjecture.\u201d\n779\nThe Adventure of the Red Circle\n\u201cWell, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cI have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours,\nMrs. Warren.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how that is to be managed, unless\nyou break in the door."

I\ncould arrange a looking-glass, maybe, and if you\nwere behind the door\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWhen does he\nlunch?\u201d\n\u201cAbout one, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThen Dr. Watson and I will come round in\ntime.

It is evidently an empty\n\ufb02at to which the confederate has access. Well, Mrs.\nWarren, what now?\u201d\n\u201cI have it all ready for you. If you will both\ncome up and leave your boots below on the land-\ning, I\u2019ll put you there now.\u201d\nIt was an excellent hiding-place which she had\narranged. The mirror was so placed that, seated\nin the dark, we could very plainly see the door\nopposite. We had hardly settled down in it, and\nMrs. Warren left us, when a distant tinkle an-\nnounced that our mysterious neighbour had rung. Presently the landlady appeared with the tray, laid\nit down upon a chair beside the closed door, and\nthen, treading heavily, departed. Crouching to-\ngether in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes\n\ufb01xed upon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady\u2019s\nfootsteps died away, there was the creak of a turn-\ning key, the handle revolved, and two thin hands\ndarted out and lifted the tray form the chair. An in-\nstant later it was hurriedly replaced, and I caught a\nglimpse of a dark, beautiful, horri\ufb01ed face glaring\nat the narrow opening of the box-room. Then the\ndoor crashed to, the key turned once more, and\nall was silence. Holmes twitched my sleeve, and\ntogether we stole down the stair. \u201cI will call again in the evening,\u201d said he to the\nexpectant landlady. \u201cI think, Watson, we can dis-\ncuss this business better in our own quarters.\u201d\n\u201cMy surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,\u201d\nsaid he, speaking from the depths of his easy-chair. \u201cThere has been a substitution of lodgers.

The mea-\nsure of that danger is the rigour of their precau-\ntions. The man, who has some work which he\nmust do, desires to leave the woman in absolute\nsafety while he does it. It is not an easy problem,\nbut he solved it in an original fashion, and so effec-\ntively that her presence was not even known to the\nlandlady who supplies her with food. The printed\nmessages, as is now evident, were to prevent her\nsex being discovered by her writing. The man can-\nnot come near the woman, or he will guide their\nenemies to her. Since he cannot communicate with\nher direct, he has recourse to the agony column of\na paper. So far all is clear.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is at the root of it?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, Watson\u2014severely practical, as usual! What is at the root of it all?

You saw the woman\u2019s face at the sign of danger. We have heard, too, of the attack upon the land-\nlord, which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger. These alarms, and the desperate need for secrecy,\nargue that the matter is one of life or death. The\nattack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the en-\nemy, whoever they are, are themselves not aware\nof the substitution of the female lodger for the\nmale.

When\ndusk comes we should \ufb01nd ourselves one stage\nadvanced in our investigation.\u201d\nWhen we returned to Mrs. Warren\u2019s rooms, the\ngloom of a London winter evening had thickened\ninto one gray curtain, a dead monotone of colour,\nbroken only by the sharp yellow squares of the\nwindows and the blurred haloes of the gas-lamps. As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of\nthe lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered\nhigh up through the obscurity. \u201cSomeone is moving in that room,\u201d said\nHolmes in a whisper, his gaunt and eager face\nthrust forward to the window-pane. \u201cYes, I can\nsee his shadow.

At the doorway of the Howe\nStreet \ufb02ats a man, muf\ufb02ed in a cravat and great-\ncoat, was leaning against the railing."

We know\nhe is at the bottom of \ufb01fty murders, and yet we\nhave nothing positive we can take him on. I\ntracked him over from New York, and I\u2019ve been\nclose to him for a week in London, waiting some\nexcuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Greg-\nson and I ran him to ground in that big tenement\nhouse, and there\u2019s only one door, so he can\u2019t slip\nus. There\u2019s three folk come out since he went in,\nbut I\u2019ll swear he wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Holmes talks of signals,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cI\nexpect, as usual, he knows a good deal that we\ndon\u2019t.\u201d\nIn a few clear words Holmes explained the sit-\nuation as it had appeared to us. The American\nstruck his hands together with vexation. \u201cHe\u2019s on to us!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it \ufb01gures out that way, does it not? Here he is, sending out messages to an accom-\nplice\u2014there are several of his gang in London. Then suddenly, just as by your own account he\nwas telling them that there was danger, he broke\nshort off. What could it mean except that from the\nwindow he had suddenly either caught sight of us\nin the street, or in some way come to understand\nhow close the danger was, and that he must act\nright away if he was to avoid it?"

Gregson \ufb02ung it open\nand held his light full blaze in front of him, while\nwe all peered eagerly over his shoulders. In the middle of the \ufb02oor of the empty room\nwas huddled the \ufb01gure of an enormous man, his\nclean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in\nits contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly\ncrimson halo of blood, lying in a broad wet circle\nupon the white woodwork. His knees were drawn\nup, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the\ncentre of his broad, brown, upturned throat there\n782\nThe Adventure of the Red Circle\nprojected the white haft of a knife driven blade-\ndeep into his body.

Then he peered into the dark-\nness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the \ufb02oor. \u201cI rather think that will be helpful,\u201d said he. He came over and stood in deep thought while the\ntwo professionals were examining the body. \u201cYou\nsay that three people came out form the \ufb02at while\nyou were waiting downstairs,\u201d said he at last. \u201cDid\nyou observe them closely?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\u201cWas there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded,\ndark, of middle size?\u201d\n\u201cYes; he was the last to pass me.\u201d\n\u201cThat is your man, I fancy."

She spoke in rapid and \ufb02uent but very unconven-\ntional English, which, for the sake of clearness, I\nwill make grammatical. \u201cI was born in Posilippo, near Naples,\u201d said\nshe, \u201cand was the daughter of Augusto Barelli,\nwho was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of\nthat part. Gennaro was in my father\u2019s employ-\nment, and I came to love him, as any woman must. He had neither money nor position\u2014nothing but\nhis beauty and strength and energy\u2014so my father\nforbade the match. We \ufb02ed together, were mar-\nried at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the money\nwhich would take us to America. This was four\nyears ago, and we have been in New York ever\nsince. \u201cFortune was very good to us at \ufb01rst. Gen-\nnaro was able to do a service to an Italian gen-\ntleman\u2014he saved him from some ruf\ufb01ans in the\nplace called the Bowery, and so made a power-\nful friend. His name was Tito Castalotte, and\nhe was the senior partner of the great \ufb01rm of\nCastalotte and Zamba, who are the chief fruit im-\nporters of New York. Signor Zamba is an in-\nvalid, and our new friend Castalotte has all power\nwithin the \ufb01rm, which employs more than three\nhundred men. He took my husband into his em-\nployment, made him head of a department, and\nshowed his good-will towards him in every way. Signor Castalotte was a bachelor, and I believe that\nhe felt as if Gennaro was his son, and both my hus-\nband and I loved him as if he were our father. We\nhad taken and furnished a little house in Brook-\nlyn, and our whole future seemed assured when\nthat black cloud appeared which was soon to over-\nspread our sky. \u201cOne night, when Gennaro returned from his\nwork, he brought a fellow-countryman back with\nhim. His name was Gorgiano, and he had come\nalso from Posilippo. He was a huge man, as you\ncan testify, for you have looked upon his corpse. Not only was his body that of a giant but every-\nthing about him was grotesque, gigantic, and ter-\nrifying."

His thoughts, his emo-\ntions, his passions, all were exaggerated and mon-\nstrous. He talked, or rather roared, with such en-\nergy that others could but sit and listen, cowed\nwith the mighty stream of words. His eyes blazed\nat you and held you at his mercy. He was a terrible\nand wonderful man. I thank God that he is dead! \u201cHe came again and again. Yet I was aware\nthat Gennaro was no more happy than I was in his\npresence. My poor husband would sit pale and\nlistless, listening to the endless raving upon poli-\ntics and upon social questions which made up or\nvisitor\u2019s conversation. Gennaro said nothing, but\nI, who knew him so well, could read in his face\nsome emotion which I had never seen there be-\nfore. At \ufb01rst I thought that it was dislike. And\nthen, gradually, I understood that it was more than\ndislike. It was fear\u2014a deep, secret, shrinking fear. That night\u2014the night that I read his terror\u2014I put\nmy arms round him and I implored him by his\nlove for me and by all that he held dear to hold\nnothing from me, and to tell me why this huge\nman overshadowed him so. \u201cHe told me, and my own heart grew cold as\nice as I listened. My poor Gennaro, in his wild and\n\ufb01ery days, when all the world seemed against him\nand his mind was driven half mad by the injustices\nof life, had joined a Neapolitan society, the Red\nCircle, which was allied to the old Carbonari. The\noaths and secrets of this brotherhood were fright-\nful, but once within its rule no escape was possible. When we had \ufb02ed to America Gennaro thought\nthat he had cast it all off forever. What was his hor-\nror one evening to meet in the streets the very man\nwho had initiated him in Naples, the giant Gor-\ngiano, a man who had earned the name of \u2018Death\u2019\nin the south of Italy, for he was red to the elbow\nin murder! He had come to New York to avoid\nthe Italian police, and he had already planted a\nbranch of this dreadful society in his new home. All this Gennaro told me and showed me a sum-\nmons which he had received that very day, a Red\nCircle drawn upon the head of it telling him that a\nlodge would be held upon a certain date, and that\nhis presence at it was required and ordered. \u201cThat was bad enough, but worse was to come. I had noticed for some time that when Gorgiano\ncame to us, as he constantly did, in the evening,\nhe spoke much to me; and even when his words\nwere to my husband those terrible, glaring, wild-\nbeast eyes of his were always turned upon me. One night his secret came out."

He pushed his way in, seized me\nin his mighty arms, hugged me in his bear\u2019s em-\nbrace, covered me with kisses, and implored me to\ncome away with him. I was struggling and scream-\ning when Gennaro entered and attacked him. He\nstruck Gennaro senseless and \ufb02ed from the house\nwhich he was never more to enter. It was a deadly\nenemy that we made that night. 784\n\u201cA few days later came the meeting. Gennaro\nreturned from it with a face which told me that\nsomething dreadful had occurred. It was worse\nthan we could have imagined possible. The funds\nof the society were raised by blackmailing rich Ital-\nians and threatening them with violence should\nthey refuse the money. It seems that Castalotte, our\ndear friend and benefactor, had been approached. He had refused to yield to threats, and he had\nhanded the notices to the police. It was resolved\nnow that such an example should be made of them\nas would prevent any other victim from rebelling. At the meeting it was arranged that he and his\nhouse should be blown up with dynamite. There\nwas a drawing of lots as to who should carry out\nthe deed. Gennaro saw our enemy\u2019s cruel face\nsmiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. No doubt it had been prearranged in some fash-\nion, for it was the fatal disc with the Red Circle\nupon it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon\nhis palm. He was to kill his best friend, or he was\nto expose himself and me to the vengeance of his\ncomrades. It was part of their \ufb01endish system to\npunish those whom they feared or hated by in-\njuring not only their own persons but those whom\nthey loved, and it was the knowledge of this which\nhung as a terror over my poor Gennaro\u2019s head and\ndrove him nearly crazy with apprehension. \u201cAll that night we sat together, our arms round\neach other, each strengthening each for the trou-\nbles that lay before us. The very next evening had\nbeen \ufb01xed for the attempt. By midday my hus-\nband and I were on our way to London, but not\nbefore he had given our benefactor full warning\nof this danger, and had also left such information\nfor the police as would safeguard his life for the\nfuture. \u201cThe rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves. We were sure that our enemies would be behind us\nlike our own shadows. Gorgiano had his private\nreasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew\nhow ruthless, cunning, and untiring he could be. Both Italy and America are full of stories of his\ndreadful powers. If ever they were exerted it\nwould be now. My darling made use of the few\nclear days which our start had given us in arrang-\ning for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no\npossible danger could reach me."

The conclusions of every department are\npassed to him, and he is the central exchange,\nthe clearinghouse, which makes out the balance. 789\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\nAll other men are specialists, but his specialism\nis omniscience. We will suppose that a minister\nneeds information as to a point which involves the\nNavy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question;\nhe could get his separate advices from various de-\npartments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus\nthem all, and say offhand how each factor would\naffect the other. They began by using him as a\nshort-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself\nan essential. In that great brain of his everything\nis pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an in-\nstant. Again and again his word has decided the\nnational policy. He lives in it. He thinks of noth-\ning else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he\nunbends if I call upon him and ask him to advise\nme on one of my little problems. But Jupiter is de-\nscending to-day. What on earth can it mean? Who\nis Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?\u201d\n\u201cI have it,\u201d I cried, and plunged among the lit-\nter of papers upon the sofa. \u201cYes, yes, here he\nis, sure enough! Cadogen West was the young\nman who was found dead on the Underground on\nTuesday morning.\u201d\nHolmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to\nhis lips. \u201cThis must be serious, Watson. A death which\nhas caused my brother to alter his habits can be no\nordinary one. What in the world can he have to do\nwith it? The case was featureless as I remember it. The young man had apparently fallen out of the\ntrain and killed himself. He had not been robbed,\nand there was no particular reason to suspect vio-\nlence. Is that not so?\u201d\n\u201cThere has been an inquest,\u201d said I, \u201cand a\ngood many fresh facts have come out. Looked at\nmore closely, I should certainly say that it was a\ncurious case.\u201d\n\u201cJudging by its effect upon my brother, I\nshould think it must be a most extraordinary one.\u201d\nHe snuggled down in his armchair. \u201cNow, Watson,\nlet us have the facts.\u201d\n\u201cThe man\u2019s name was Arthur Cadogan West. He was twenty-seven years of age, unmarried, and\na clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.\u201d\n\u201cGovernment employ. Behold the link with\nBrother Mycroft!\u201d\n\u201cHe left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night. Was last seen by his \ufb01ancee, Miss Violet Westbury,\nwhom he left abruptly in the fog about 7.30 that\nevening. There was no quarrel between them and\nshe can give no motive for his action."

It was lying wide of the metals upon the left\nhand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point\nclose to the station, where the line emerges from\nthe tunnel in which it runs. The head was badly\ncrushed\u2014an injury which might well have been\ncaused by a fall from the train. The body could\nonly have come on the line in that way. Had it\nbeen carried down from any neighbouring street,\nit must have passed the station barriers, where a\ncollector is always standing. This point seems ab-\nsolutely certain.\u201d\n\u201cVery good. The case is de\ufb01nite enough. The\nman, dead or alive, either fell or was precipitated\nfrom a train. So much is clear to me. Continue.\u201d\n\u201cThe trains which traverse the lines of rail\nbeside which the body was found are those\nwhich run from west to east, some being purely\nMetropolitan, and some from Willesden and out-\nlying junctions. It can be stated for certain that this\nyoung man, when he met his death, was travelling\nin this direction at some late hour of the night, but\nat what point he entered the train it is impossible\nto state.\u201d\n\u201cHis ticket, of course, would show that.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no ticket in his pockets.\u201d\n\u201cNo ticket! Dear me, Watson, this is really very\nsingular. According to my experience it is not pos-\nsible to reach the platform of a Metropolitan train\nwithout exhibiting one\u2019s ticket. Presumably, then,\nthe young man had one. Was it taken from him in\norder to conceal the station from which he came? It is possible. Or did he drop it in the carriage? That is also possible. But the point is of curious\ninterest. I understand that there was no sign of\nrobbery?\u201d\n\u201cApparently not. There is a list here of his\npossessions. His purse contained two pounds \ufb01f-\nteen. He had also a check-book on the Woolwich\nbranch of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through\nthis his identity was established. There were also\ntwo dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich Theatre,\ndated for that very evening. Also a small packet of\ntechnical papers.\u201d\nHolmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction. \u201cThere we have it at last, Watson! British\ngovernment\u2014Woolwich. Arsenal\u2014technical pa-\npers\u2014Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete. But\n790\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\nhere he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for\nhimself.\u201d\nA moment later the tall and portly form of My-\ncroft Holmes was ushered into the room. Heavily\nbuilt and massive, there was a suggestion of un-\ncouth physical inertia in the \ufb01gure, but above this\nunwieldy frame there was perched a head so mas-\nterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set\neyes, so \ufb01rm in its lips, and so subtle in its play\nof expression, that after the \ufb01rst glance one forgot\nthe gross body and remembered only the domi-\nnant mind."

The\ndetective shook hands without a word. Mycroft\nHolmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided\ninto an armchair. \u201cA most annoying business, Sherlock,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cI extremely dislike altering my habits, but\nthe powers that be would take no denial. In the\npresent state of Siam it is most awkward that I\nshould be away from the of\ufb01ce. But it is a real cri-\nsis. I have never seen the Prime Minister so upset. As to the Admiralty\u2014it is buzzing like an over-\nturned bee-hive. Have you read up the case?\u201d\n\u201cWe have just done so. What were the technical\npapers?\u201d\n\u201cAh, there\u2019s the point! Fortunately, it has not\ncome out. The press would be furious if it did. The papers which this wretched youth had in his\npocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington sub-\nmarine.\u201d\nMycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which\nshowed his sense of the importance of the subject. His brother and I sat expectant. \u201cSurely you have heard of it? I thought every-\none had heard of it.\u201d\n\u201cOnly as a name.\u201d\n\u201cIts importance can hardly be exaggerated. It\nhas been the most jealously guarded of all govern-\nment secrets. You may take it from me that naval\nwarfare becomes impossible within the radius of\na Bruce-Partington\u2019s operation. Two years ago a\nvery large sum was smuggled through the Esti-\nmates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly\nof the invention. Every effort has been made to\nkeep the secret. The plans, which are exceedingly\nintricate, comprising some thirty separate patents,\neach essential to the working of the whole, are kept\nin an elaborate safe in a con\ufb01dential of\ufb01ce adjoin-\ning the arsenal, with burglar-proof doors and win-\ndows. Under no conceivable circumstances were\nthe plans to be taken from the of\ufb01ce. If the chief\nconstructor of the Navy desired to consult them,\neven he was forced to go to the Woolwich of\ufb01ce\nfor the purpose. And yet here we \ufb01nd them in\nthe pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of\nLondon. From an of\ufb01cial point of view it\u2019s simply\nawful.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have recovered them?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Sherlock, no! That\u2019s the pinch. We have\nnot. Ten papers were taken from Woolwich. There\nwere seven in the pocket of Cadogan West. The\nthree most essential are gone\u2014stolen, vanished. You must drop everything, Sherlock. Never mind\nyour usual petty puzzles of the police-court. It\u2019s a\nvital international problem that you have to solve. Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are\nthe missing ones, how did he die, how came his\nbody where it was found, how can the evil be set\nright? Find an answer to all these questions, and\nyou will have done good service for your country.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft? You can see as far as I.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly, Sherlock. But it is a question of\ngetting details."

Some more facts, please.\u201d\n\u201cI have jotted down the more essential ones\nupon this sheet of paper, together with a few ad-\ndresses which you will \ufb01nd of service. The actual\nof\ufb01cial guardian of the papers is the famous gov-\nernment expert, Sir James Walter, whose decora-\ntions and sub-titles \ufb01ll two lines of a book of refer-\nence.

I may add that the papers were undoubt-\nedly in the of\ufb01ce during working hours on Mon-\nday, and that Sir James left for London about three\no\u2019clock taking his key with him. He was at the\nhouse of Admiral Sinclair at Barclay Square dur-\ning the whole of the evening when this incident\noccurred.\u201d\n\u201cHas the fact been veri\ufb01ed?\u201d\n791\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\n\u201cYes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has\ntesti\ufb01ed to his departure from Woolwich, and Ad-\nmiral Sinclair to his arrival in London; so Sir James\nis no longer a direct factor in the problem.\u201d\n\u201cWho was the other man with a key?\u201d\n\u201cThe senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sid-\nney Johnson. He is a man of forty, married, with\n\ufb01ve children. He is a silent, morose man, but he\nhas, on the whole, an excellent record in the pub-\nlic service. He is unpopular with his colleagues,\nbut a hard worker. According to his own account,\ncorroborated only by the word of his wife, he was\nat home the whole of Monday evening after of\ufb01ce\nhours, and his key has never left the watch-chain\nupon which it hangs.\u201d\n\u201cTell us about Cadogan West.\u201d\n\u201cHe has been ten years in the service and has\ndone good work. He has the reputation of being\nhot-headed and imperious, but a straight, honest\nman. We have nothing against him. He was next\nSidney Johnson in the of\ufb01ce. His duties brought\nhim into daily, personal contact with the plans. No\none else had the handling of them.\u201d\n\u201cWho locked up the plans that night?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is surely perfectly clear who took them\naway.

Young West took the papers. Now this\ncould only be done by having a false key\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSeveral false keys. He had to open the build-\ning and the room.\u201d\n\u201cHe had, then, several false keys. He took the\npapers to London to sell the secret, intending, no\ndoubt, to have the plans themselves back in the\nsafe next morning before they were missed. While\nin London on this treasonable mission he met his\nend.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cWe will suppose that he was travelling back to\nWoolwich when he was killed and thrown out of\nthe compartment.\u201d\n\u201cAldgate, where the body was found, is con-\nsiderably past the station London Bridge, which\nwould be his route to Woolwich.\u201d\n\u201cMany circumstances could be imagined under\nwhich he would pass London Bridge. There was\nsomeone in the carriage, for example, with whom\nhe was having an absorbing interview. This inter-\nview led to a violent scene in which he lost his life. Possibly he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on\nthe line, and so met his end. The other closed the\ndoor. There was a thick fog, and nothing could be\nseen.\u201d\n\u201cNo better explanation can be given with our\npresent knowledge; and yet consider, Sherlock,\nhow much you leave untouched. We will suppose,\nfor argument\u2019s sake, that young Cadogan West had\ndetermined to convey these papers to London. He\nwould naturally have made an appointment with\nthe foreign agent and kept his evening clear. In-\nstead of that he took two tickets for the theatre,\nescorted his \ufb01ancee halfway there, and then sud-\ndenly disappeared.\u201d\n\u201cA blind,\u201d said Lestrade, who had sat listening\nwith some impatience to the conversation. \u201cA very singular one. That is objection No. 1. Objection No. 2: We will suppose that he reaches\nLondon and sees the foreign agent. He must bring\nback the papers before morning or the loss will be\ndiscovered. He took away ten. Only seven were in\nhis pocket. What had become of the other three? He certainly would not leave them of his own free\nwill. Then, again, where is the price of his treason? Once would have expected to \ufb01nd a large sum of\nmoney in his pocket.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to me perfectly clear,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cI have no doubt at all as to what occurred. He\ntook the papers to sell them. He saw the agent. They could not agree as to price. He started home\nagain, but the agent went with him. In the train the\nagent murdered him, took the more essential pa-\npers, and threw his body from the carriage."

Therefore he took\nit from the murdered man\u2019s pocket.\u201d\n\u201cGood, Lestrade, very good,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour theory holds together.

There was dense\nfog, however, and nothing could be seen. He made\nno report of it at the time. Why, whatever is the\nmatter with Mr. Holmes?\u201d\nMy friend was standing with an expression of\nstrained intensity upon his face, staring at the rail-\nway metals where they curved out of the tunnel. Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of\npoints. On these his eager, questioning eyes were\n\ufb01xed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tight-\nening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and\nconcentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I\nknew so well. \u201cPoints,\u201d he muttered; \u201cthe points.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of it?

He\nwas a different man from the limp and lounging\n\ufb01gure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who\nhad prowled so restlessly only a few hours before\nround the fog-girt room. \u201cThere is material here.

Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.\u201d\n794\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\nA small but well-kept house in the outskirts of\nthe town sheltered the bereaved mother. The old\nlady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to\nus, but at her side was a white-faced young lady,\nwho introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury,\nthe \ufb01ancee of the dead man, and the last to see\nhim upon that fatal night. \u201cI cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\nhave not shut an eye since the tragedy, thinking,\nthinking, thinking, night and day, what the true\nmeaning of it can be. Arthur was the most single-\nminded, chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth. He\nwould have cut his right hand off before he would\nsell a State secret con\ufb01ded to his keeping. It is\nabsurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who\nknew him.\u201d\n\u201cBut the facts, Miss Westbury?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.\u201d\n\u201cWas he in any want of money?\u201d\n\u201cNo; his needs were very simple and his salary\nample. He had saved a few hundreds, and we were\nto marry at the New Year.\u201d\n\u201cNo signs of any mental excitement? Come,\nMiss Westbury, be absolutely frank with us.\u201d\nThe quick eye of my companion had noted\nsome change in her manner. She coloured and hes-\nitated. \u201cYes,\u201d she said at last, \u201cI had a feeling that\nthere was something on his mind.\u201d\n\u201cFor long?\u201d\n\u201cOnly for the last week or so. He was thought-\nful and worried. Once I pressed him about it. He\nadmitted that there was something, and that it was\nconcerned with his of\ufb01cial life. \u2019It is too serious for\nme to speak about, even to you,\u2019 said he. I could\nget nothing more.\u201d\nHolmes looked grave. \u201cGo on, Miss Westbury. Even if it seems to tell\nagainst him, go on. We cannot say what it may\nlead to.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, I have nothing more to tell. Once or\ntwice it seemed to me that he was on the point of\ntelling me something. He spoke one evening of the\nimportance of the secret, and I have some recollec-\ntion that he said that no doubt foreign spies would\npay a great deal to have it.\u201d\nMy friend\u2019s face grew graver still. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\u201cHe said that we were slack about such mat-\nters\u2014that it would be easy for a traitor to get the\nplans.\u201d\n\u201cWas it only recently that he made such re-\nmarks?\u201d\n\u201cYes, quite recently.\u201d\n\u201cNow tell us of that last evening.\u201d\n\u201cWe were to go to the theatre. The fog was so\nthick that a cab was useless. We walked, and our\nway took us close to the of\ufb01ce. Suddenly he darted\naway into the fog.\u201d\n\u201cWithout a word?\u201d\n\u201cHe gave an exclamation; that was all."

Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save\nhis honour! It was so much to him.\u201d\nHolmes shook his head sadly. \u201cCome, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cour ways lie else-\nwhere. Our next station must be the of\ufb01ce from\nwhich the papers were taken. \u201cIt was black enough before against this young\nman, but our inquiries make it blacker,\u201d he re-\nmarked as the cab lumbered off. \u201cHis coming mar-\nriage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally\nwanted money. The idea was in his head, since he\nspoke about it. He nearly made the girl an accom-\nplice in the treason by telling her his plans. It is all\nvery bad.\u201d\n\u201cBut surely, Holmes, character goes for some-\nthing? Then, again, why should he leave the girl\nin the street and dart away to commit a felony?\u201d\n\u201cExactly! There are certainly objections. But it\nis a formidable case which they have to meet.\u201d\nMr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at\nthe of\ufb01ce and received us with that respect which\nmy companion\u2019s card always commanded. He was\na thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his\ncheeks haggard, and his hands twitching from the\nnervous strain to which he had been subjected. \u201cIt is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad! Have you\nheard of the death of the chief?\u201d\n\u201cWe have just come from his house.\u201d\n\u201cThe place is disorganized. The chief dead,\nCadogan West dead, our papers stolen. And yet,\nwhen we closed our door on Monday evening, we\nwere as ef\ufb01cient an of\ufb01ce as any in the government\nservice. Good God, it\u2019s dreadful to think of! That\nWest, of all men, should have done such a thing!\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure of his guilt, then?\u201d\n\u201cI can see no other way out of it. And yet I\nwould have trusted him as I trust myself.\u201d\n\u201cAt what hour was the of\ufb01ce closed on Mon-\nday?\u201d\n\u201cAt \ufb01ve.\u201d\n795\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\n\u201cDid you close it?\u201d\n\u201cI am always the last man out.\u201d\n\u201cWhere were the plans?\u201d\n\u201cIn that safe. I put them there myself.\u201d\n\u201cIs there no watchman to the building?\u201d\n\u201cThere is, but he has other departments to look\nafter as well. He is an old soldier and a most trust-\nworthy man. He saw nothing that evening. Of\ncourse the fog was very thick.\u201d\n\u201cSuppose that Cadogan West wished to make\nhis way into the building after hours; he would\nneed three keys, would he not, before the could\nreach the papers?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he would. The key of the outer door, the\nkey of the of\ufb01ce, and the key of the safe.\u201d\n\u201cOnly Sir James Walter and you had those\nkeys?\u201d\n\u201cI had no keys of the doors\u2014only of the safe.\u201d\n\u201cWas Sir James a man who was orderly in his\nhabits?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I think he was."

I have often seen them there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that ring went with him to London?\u201d\n\u201cHe said so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your key never left your possession?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cThen West, if he is the culprit, must have had a\nduplicate. And yet none was found upon his body. One other point: if a clerk in this of\ufb01ce desired to\nsell the plans, would it not be simply to copy the\nplans for himself than to take the originals, as was\nactually done?\u201d\n\u201cIt would take considerable technical knowl-\nedge to copy the plans in an effective way.\u201d\n\u201cBut I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West\nhas that technical knowledge?\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt we had, but I beg you won\u2019t try to\ndrag me into the matter, Mr. Holmes. What is the\nuse of our speculating in this way when the origi-\nnal plans were actually found on West?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is certainly singular that he should run\nthe risk of taking originals if he could safely have\ntaken copies, which would have equally served his\nturn.\u201d\n\u201cSingular, no doubt\u2014and yet he did so.\u201d\n\u201cEvery inquiry in this case reveals something\ninexplicable. Now there are three papers still miss-\ning. They are, as I understand, the vital ones.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that is so.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean to say that anyone holding these\nthree papers, and without the seven others, could\nconstruct a Bruce-Partington submarine?\u201d\n\u201cI reported to that effect to the Admiralty. But\nto-day I have been over the drawings again, and I\nam not so sure of it. The double valves with the\nautomatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of\nthe papers which have been returned. Until the\nforeigners had invented that for themselves they\ncould not make the boat. Of course they might\nsoon get over the dif\ufb01culty.\u201d\n\u201cBut the three missing drawings are the most\nimportant?\u201d\n\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d\n\u201cI think, with your permission, I will now take\na stroll round the premises. I do not recall any\nother question which I desired to ask.\u201d\nHe examined the lock of the safe, the door of\nthe room, and \ufb01nally the iron shutters of the win-\ndow. It was only when we were on the lawn out-\nside that his interest was strongly excited. There\nwas a laurel bush outside the window, and several\nof the branches bore signs of having been twisted\nor snapped. He examined them carefully with his\nlens, and then some dim and vague marks upon\nthe earth beneath. Finally he asked the chief clerk\nto close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to\nme that they hardly met in the centre, and that it\nwould be possible for anyone outside to see what\nwas going on within the room. \u201cThe indications are ruined by three days\u2019 de-\nlay. They may mean something or nothing. Well,\nWatson, I do not think that Woolwich can help us\nfurther. It is a small crop which we have gathered."

        "text": "Let us see if we can do better in London.\u201d\nYet we added one more sheaf to our harvest\nbefore we left Woolwich Station. The clerk in the\nticket of\ufb01ce was able to say with con\ufb01dence that\nhe saw Cadogan West\u2014whom he knew well by\nsight\u2014upon the Monday night, and that he went\nto London by the 8.15 to London Bridge. He was\nalone and took a single third-class ticket. The clerk\nwas struck at the time by his excited and nervous\nmanner. So shaky was he that he could hardly pick\nup his change, and the clerk had helped him with\nit. A reference to the timetable showed that the\n8.15 was the \ufb01rst train which it was possible for\nWest to take after he had left the lady about 7.30. \u201cLet us reconstruct, Watson,\u201d said Holmes after\nhalf an hour of silence. \u201cI am not aware that in all\nour joint researches we have ever had a case which\nwas more dif\ufb01cult to get at. Every fresh advance\nwhich we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. 796\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\nAnd yet we have surely made some appreciable\nprogress. \u201cThe effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in\nthe main been against young Cadogan West; but\nthe indications at the window would lend them-\nselves to a more favourable hypothesis. Let us sup-\npose, for example, that he had been approached\nby some foreign agent. It might have been done\nunder such pledges as would have prevented him\nfrom speaking of it, and yet would have affected\nhis thoughts in the direction indicated by his re-\nmarks to his \ufb01ancee. Very good. We will now sup-\npose that as he went to the theatre with the young\nlady he suddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of\nthis same agent going in the direction of the of-\n\ufb01ce. He was an impetuous man, quick in his de-\ncisions. Everything gave way to his duty. He fol-\nlowed the man, reached the window, saw the ab-\nstraction of the documents, and pursued the thief. In this way we get over the objection that no one\nwould take originals when he could make copies. This outsider had to take originals. So far it holds\ntogether.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the next step?\u201d\n\u201cThen we come into dif\ufb01culties. One would\nimagine that under such circumstances the \ufb01rst act\nof young Cadogan West would be to seize the vil-\nlain and raise the alarm. Why did he not do so? Could it have been an of\ufb01cial superior who took\nthe papers? That would explain West\u2019s conduct. Or could the chief have given West the slip in the\nfog, and West started at once to London to head\nhim off from his own rooms, presuming that he\nknew where the rooms were? The call must have\nbeen very pressing, since he left his girl standing\nin the fog and made no effort to communicate with\nher. Our scent runs cold here, and there is a vast\ngap between either hypothesis and the laying of\nWest\u2019s body, with seven papers in his pocket, on\nthe roof of a Metropolitan train."

If Mycroft has given\nus the list of addresses we may be able to pick our\nman and follow two tracks instead of one.\u201d\nSurely enough, a note awaited us at Baker\nStreet. A government messenger had brought it\npost-haste. Holmes glanced at it and threw it over\nto me. There are numerous small fry, but few\nwho would handle so big an affair. The only men worth considering are\nAdolph Mayer, of 13 Great George\nStreet, Westminster;\nLouis La Roth-\niere, of Campden Mansions, Notting\nHill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caul\ufb01eld\nGardens, Kensington. The latter was\nknown to be in town on Monday and\nis now reported as having left. Glad\nto hear you have seen some light. The\nCabinet awaits your \ufb01nal report with\nthe utmost anxiety.

The whole force of the State\nis at your back if you should need it. \u2014 Mycroft. \u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Holmes, smiling, \u201cthat all\nthe queen\u2019s horses and all the queen\u2019s men can-\nnot avail in this matter.\u201d He had spread out his\nbig map of London and leaned eagerly over it. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said he presently with an exclama-\ntion of satisfaction, \u201cthings are turning a little in\nour direction at last. Why, Watson, I do honestly\nbelieve that we are going to pull it off, after all.\u201d He\nslapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst\nof hilarity. \u201cI am going out now. It is only a recon-\nnaissance. I will do nothing serious without my\ntrusted comrade and biographer at my elbow. Do\nyou stay here, and the odds are that you will see\nme again in an hour or two. If time hangs heavy\nget foolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative\nof how we saved the State.\u201d\nI felt some re\ufb02ection of his elation in my own\nmind, for I knew well that he would not depart\nso far from his usual austerity of demeanour un-\nless there was good cause for exultation. All the\nlong November evening I waited, \ufb01lled with im-\npatience for his return. At last, shortly after nine\no\u2019clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:\nAm dining at Goldini\u2019s Restaurant,\nGloucester Road, Kensington. Please\ncome at once and join me there. Bring\nwith you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a\nchisel, and a revolver. \u2014 S.H. It was a nice equipment for a respectable citi-\nzen to carry through the dim, fog-draped streets. I stowed them all discreetly away in my overcoat\nand drove straight to the address given. There sat\nmy friend at a little round table near the door of\nthe garish Italian restaurant. \u201cHave you had something to eat? Then join me\nin a coffee and curacao.

That was clear from the in-\nstant that I determined the fact that it was from the\nroof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.\u201d\n\u201cCould it not have been dropped from a\nbridge?\u201d\n\u201cI should say it was impossible. If you exam-\nine the roofs you will \ufb01nd that they are slightly\nrounded, and there is no railing round them. Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cado-\ngan West was placed on it.\u201d\n\u201cHow could he be placed there?\u201d\n\u201cThat was the question which we had to an-\nswer. There is only one possible way. You are\naware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels\nat some points in the West End. I had a vague\nmemory that as I have travelled by it I have occa-\nsionally seen windows just above my head. Now,\nsuppose that a train halted under such a window,\nwould there be any dif\ufb01culty in laying a body\nupon the roof?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems most improbable.\u201d\n\u201cWe must fall back upon the old axiom that\nwhen all other contingencies fail, whatever re-\nmains, however improbable, must be the truth. Here all other contingencies have failed. When I\nfound that the leading international agent, who\nhad just left London, lived in a row of houses\nwhich abutted upon the Underground, I was so\npleased that you were a little astonished at my\nsudden frivolity.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that was it, was it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that was it. Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13\nCaul\ufb01eld Gardens, had become my objective. I\nbegan my operations at Gloucester Road Station,\nwhere a very helpful of\ufb01cial walked with me along\nthe track and allowed me to satisfy myself not\nonly that the back-stair windows of Caul\ufb01eld Gar-\ndens open on the line but the even more essential\nfact that, owing to the intersection of one of the\nlarger railways, the Underground trains are fre-\nquently held motionless for some minutes at that\nvery spot.\u201d\n\u201cSplendid, Holmes! You have got it!\u201d\n\u201cSo far\u2014so far, Watson. We advance, but the\ngoal is afar. Well, having seen the back of Caul\ufb01eld\nGardens, I visited the front and satis\ufb01ed myself\nthat the bird was indeed \ufb02own. It is a considerable\nhouse, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the\nupper rooms. Oberstein lived there with a single\nvalet, who was probably a confederate entirely in\nhis con\ufb01dence. We must bear in mind that Ober-\nstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his\nbooty, but not with any idea of \ufb02ight; for he had\nno reason to fear a warrant, and the idea of an am-\nateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur\nto him. Yet that is precisely what we are about to\nmake.\u201d\n\u201cCould we not get a warrant and legalize it?\u201d\n\u201cHardly on the evidence.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can we hope to do?\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot tell what correspondence may be\nthere.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it, Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the\nstreet."

Hardly had we reached the dark shadows before\nthe step of the policeman was heard in the fog\nabove. As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set\nto work upon the lower door.

Holmes\nswept his light along the window-sill. It was\nthickly coated with soot from the passing engines,\nbut the black surface was blurred and rubbed in\nplaces. \u201cYou can see where they rested the body. Hal-\nloa, Watson! what is this? There can be no doubt\nthat it is a blood mark.\u201d He was pointing to faint\ndiscolourations along the woodwork of the win-\ndow. \u201cHere it is on the stone of the stair also.

You have never risen to a\ngreater height.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot agree with you there. From the mo-\nment that I conceived the idea of the body being\nupon the roof, which surely was not a very ab-\nstruse one, all the rest was inevitable. If it were\nnot for the grave interests involved the affair up\nto this point would be insigni\ufb01cant. Our dif\ufb01cul-\nties are still before us. But perhaps we may \ufb01nd\nsomething here which may help us.\u201d\nWe had ascended the kitchen stair and entered\nthe suite of rooms upon the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor. One was\na dining-room, severely furnished and containing\nnothing of interest. A second was a bedroom,\nwhich also drew blank. The remaining room ap-\npeared more promising, and my companion set-\ntled down to a systematic examination. It was lit-\ntered with books and papers, and was evidently\nused as a study. Swiftly and methodically Holmes\nturned over the contents of drawer after drawer\nand cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of suc-\ncess came to brighten his austere face.

I\nthink we might drive round to the of\ufb01ces of the\nDaily Telegraph, and so bring a good day\u2019s work\nto a conclusion.\u201d\nMycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round\nby appointment after breakfast next day and Sher-\nlock Holmes had recounted to them our proceed-\nings of the day before. The professional shook his\nhead over our confessed burglary. \u201cWe can\u2019t do these things in the force, Mr.\nHolmes,\u201d said he. \u201cNo wonder you get results that\nare beyond us. But some of these days you\u2019ll go\ntoo far, and you\u2019ll \ufb01nd yourself and your friend in\ntrouble.\u201d\n799\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\n\u201cFor England, home and beauty\u2014eh, Watson? Martyrs on the altar of our country. But what do\nyou think of it, Mycroft?\u201d\n\u201cExcellent, Sherlock! Admirable! But what use\nwill you make of it?\u201d\nHolmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which\nlay upon the table. \u201cHave you seen Pierrot\u2019s advertisement to-\nday?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Another one?\u201d\n\u201cYes, here it is:\n\u201cTo-night. Same hour. Same place. Two taps. Most vitally important. Your\nown safety at stake. \u2014 Pierrot. \u201cBy George!\u201d cried Lestrade. \u201cIf he answers\nthat we\u2019ve got him!\u201d\n\u201cThat was my idea when I put it in. I think if\nyou could both make it convenient to come with us\nabout eight o\u2019clock to Caul\ufb01eld Gardens we might\npossibly get a little nearer to a solution.\u201d\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of\nSherlock Holmes was his power of throwing his\nbrain out of action and switching all his thoughts\non to lighter things whenever he had convinced\nhimself that he could no longer work to advan-\ntage. I remember that during the whole of that\nmemorable day he lost himself in a monograph\nwhich he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic\nMotets of Lassus. For my own part I had none\nof this power of detachment, and the day, in con-\nsequence, appeared to be interminable. The great\nnational importance of the issue, the suspense in\nhigh quarters, the direct nature of the experiment\nwhich we were trying\u2014all combined to work upon\nmy nerve. It was a relief to me when at last, af-\nter a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition. Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at\nthe outside of Gloucester Road Station. The area\ndoor of Oberstein\u2019s house had been left open the\nnight before, and it was necessary for me, as My-\ncroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined\nto climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall\ndoor. By nine o\u2019clock we were all seated in the\nstudy, waiting patently for our man. An hour passed and yet another. When eleven\nstruck, the measured beat of the great church clock\nseemed to sound the dirge of our hopes. Lestrade\nand Mycroft were \ufb01dgeting in their seats and look-\ning twice a minute at their watches."

There had been a furtive step past the door. Now it returned. We heard a shuf\ufb02ing sound out-\nside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker. Holmes rose, motioning us to remain seated. The\ngas in the hall was a mere point of light. He\nopened the outer door, and then as a dark \ufb01gure\nslipped past him he closed and fastened it. \u201cThis\nway!\u201d we heard him say, and a moment later our\nman stood before us. Holmes had followed him\nclosely, and as the man turned with a cry of sur-\nprise and alarm he caught him by the collar and\nthrew him back into the room. Before our pris-\noner had recovered his balance the door was shut\nand Holmes standing with his back against it. The\nman glared round him, staggered, and fell sense-\nless upon the \ufb02oor. With the shock, his broad-\nbrimmed hat \ufb02ew from his head, his cravat slipped\nsown from his lips, and there were the long light\nbeard and the soft, handsome delicate features of\nColonel Valentine Walter. Holmes gave a whistle of surprise. \u201cYou can write me down an ass this time, Wat-\nson,\u201d said he. \u201cThis was not the bird that I was\nlooking for.\u201d\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d asked Mycroft eagerly. \u201cThe younger brother of the late Sir James Wal-\nter, the head of the Submarine Department. Yes,\nyes; I see the fall of the cards. He is coming to. I think that you had best leave his examination to\nme.\u201d\nWe had carried the prostrate body to the sofa. Now our prisoner sat up, looked round him with\na horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over\nhis forehead, like one who cannot believe his own\nsenses. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI came here to visit\nMr. Oberstein.\u201d\n\u201cEverything is known, Colonel Walter,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cHow an English gentleman could be-\nhave in such a manner is beyond my comprehen-\nsion. But your whole correspondence and relations\nwith Oberstein are within our knowledge. So also\nare the circumstances connected with the death of\nyoung Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain\nat least the small credit for repentance and con-\nfession, since there are still some details which we\ncan only learn from your lips.\u201d\nThe man groaned and sank his face in his\nhands. We waited, but he was silent. \u201cI can assure you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat every es-\nsential is already known. We know that you were\npressed for money; that you took an impress of the\n800\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\nkeys which your brother held; and that you en-\ntered into a correspondence with Oberstein, who\nanswered your letters through the advertisement\ncolumns of the Daily Telegraph. We are aware that\nyou went down to the of\ufb01ce in the fog on Mon-\nday night, but that you were seen and followed\nby young Cadogan West, who had probably some\nprevious reason to suspect you."

Leaving all his private concerns, like the\ngood citizen that he was, he followed you closely\nin the fog and kept at your heels until you reached\nthis very house. There he intervened, and then it\nwas, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the\nmore terrible crime of murder.\u201d\n\u201cI did not! I did not! Before God I swear that I\ndid not!\u201d cried our wretched prisoner. \u201cTell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end\nbefore you laid him upon the roof of a railway car-\nriage.\u201d\n\u201cI will. I swear to you that I will. I did the\nrest. I confess it. It was just as you say. A Stock\nExchange debt had to be paid. I needed the money\nbadly. Oberstein offered me \ufb01ve thousand. It was\nto save myself from ruin. But as to murder, I am\nas innocent as you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened, then?\u201d\n\u201cHe had his suspicions before, and he followed\nme as you describe. I never knew it until I was\nat the very door. It was thick fog, and one could\nnot see three yards. I had given two taps and Ober-\nstein had come to the door. The young man rushed\nup and demanded to know what we were about to\ndo with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-\npreserver. He always carried it with him. As West\nforced his way after us into the house Oberstein\nstruck him on the head. The blow was a fatal one. He was dead within \ufb01ve minutes. There he lay\nin the hall, and we were at our wit\u2019s end what to\ndo. Then Oberstein had this idea about the trains\nwhich halted under his back window. But \ufb01rst he\nexamined the papers which I had brought. He said\nthat three of them were essential, and that he must\nkeep them. \u2019You cannot keep them,\u2019 said I. \u2019There\nwill be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not\nreturned.\u2019 \u2019I must keep them,\u2019 said he, \u2019for they\nare so technical that it is impossible in the time to\nmake copies.\u2019 \u2019Then they must all go back together\nto-night,\u2019 said I. He thought for a little, and then\nhe cried out that he had it. \u2019Three I will keep,\u2019\nsaid he. \u2019The others we will stuff into the pocket\nof this young man. When he is found the whole\nbusiness will assuredly be put to his account.\u2019 I\ncould see no other way out of it, so we did as he\nsuggested. We waited half an hour at the window\nbefore a train stopped. It was so thick that nothing\ncould be seen, and we had no dif\ufb01culty in lower-\ning West\u2019s body on to the train. That was the end\nof the matter so far as I was concerned.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your brother?\u201d\n\u201cHe said nothing, but he had caught me once\nwith his keys, and I think that he suspected."

As to Holmes,\nhe returned refreshed to his monograph upon the\nPolyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been\nprinted for private circulation, and is said by ex-\nperts to be the last word upon the subject. Some\nweeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my\nfriend spent a day at Windsor, whence be returned\nwith a remarkably \ufb01ne emerald tie-pin. When\nI asked him if he had bought it, he answered\nthat it was a present from a certain gracious lady\nin whose interests he had once been fortunate\nenough to carry out a small commission. He said\nno more; but I fancy that I could guess at that\nlady\u2019s august name, and I have little doubt that the\nemerald pin will forever recall to my friend\u2019s mem-\nory the adventure of the Bruce-Partington plans.

Not only was her \ufb01rst-\ufb02oor \ufb02at invaded\nat all hours by throngs of singular and\noften undesirable characters but her remarkable\nlodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in\nhis life which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music\nat strange hours, his occasional revolver practice\nwithin doors, his weird and often malodorous sci-\nenti\ufb01c experiments, and the atmosphere of vio-\nlence and danger which hung around him made\nhim the very worst tenant in London. On the other\nhand, his payments were princely. I have no doubt\nthat the house might have been purchased at the\nprice which Holmes paid for his rooms during the\nyears that I was with him. The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him\nand never dared to interfere with him, however\noutrageous his proceedings might seem. She was\nfond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentle-\nness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He\ndisliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always\na chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was\nher regard for him, I listened earnestly to her story\nwhen she came to my rooms in the second year of\nmy married life and told me of the sad condition\nto which my poor friend was reduced. \u201cHe\u2019s dying, Dr. Watson,\u201d said she. \u201cFor three\ndays he has been sinking, and I doubt if he will\nlast the day. He would not let me get a doctor. This morning when I saw his bones sticking out\nof his face and his great bright eyes looking at me\nI could stand no more of it. \u2018With your leave or\nwithout it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor\nthis very hour,\u2019 said I. \u2018Let it be Watson, then,\u2019 said\nhe. I wouldn\u2019t waste an hour in coming to him, sir,\nor you may not see him alive.\u201d\nI was horri\ufb01ed for I had heard nothing of his\nillness. I need not say that I rushed for my coat\nand my hat. As we drove back I asked for the de-\ntails. \u201cThere is little I can tell you, sir. He has been\nworking at a case down at Rotherhithe, in an alley\nnear the river, and he has brought this illness back\nwith him. He took to his bed on Wednesday after-\nnoon and has never moved since. For these three\ndays neither food nor drink has passed his lips.\u201d\n\u201cGood God! Why did you not call in a doctor?\u201d\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have it, sir. You know how mas-\nterful he is. I didn\u2019t dare to disobey him. But he\u2019s\nnot long for this world, as you\u2019ll see for yourself\nthe moment that you set eyes on him.\u201d\nHe was indeed a deplorable spectacle. In the\ndim light of a foggy November day the sick room\nwas a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt, wasted\nface staring at me from the bed which sent a chill\nto my heart."

He is a very methodical person, and I\ndid not desire you to start before six, because I\nwas well aware that you would not \ufb01nd him in his\nstudy. If you could persuade him to come here\nand give us the bene\ufb01t of his unique experience\nof this disease, the investigation of which has been\nhis dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could\nhelp me.\u201d\nI gave Holmes\u2019s remarks as a consecutive\nwhole and will not attempt to indicate how they\nwere interrupted by gaspings for breath and those\nclutchings of his hands which indicated the pain\nfrom which he was suffering. His appearance had\nchanged for the worse during the few hours that I\nhad been with him. Those hectic spots were more\npronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of\ndarker hollows, and a cold sweat glimmered upon\nhis brow. He still retained, however, the jaunty\ngallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would\nalways be the master. \u201cYou will tell him exactly how you have left\nme,\u201d said he. \u201cYou will convey the very impres-\nsion which is in your own mind\u2014a dying man\u2014a\ndying and delirious man. Indeed, I cannot think\nwhy the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid\nmass of oysters, so proli\ufb01c the creatures seem. Ah,\nI am wondering! Strange how the brain controls\nthe brain! What was I saying, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cMy directions for Mr. Culverton Smith.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, I remember. My life depends upon it. Plead with him, Watson. There is no good feeling\nbetween us. His nephew, Watson\u2014I had suspi-\ncions of foul play and I allowed him to see it. The\nboy died horribly. He has a grudge against me. You will soften him, Watson."

No, no;\nhorrible! You\u2019ll convey all that is in your mind.\u201d\nI left him full of the image of this magni\ufb01-\ncent intellect babbling like a foolish child. He had\nhanded me the key, and with a happy thought I\ntook it with me lest he should lock himself in. Mrs.\nHudson was waiting, trembling and weeping, in\nthe passage. Behind me as I passed from the \ufb02at I\nheard Holmes\u2019s high, thin voice in some delirious\nchant. Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man\ncame on me through the fog. \u201cHow is Mr. Holmes, sir?\u201d he asked. It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton,\nof Scotland Yard, dressed in unof\ufb01cial tweeds. \u201cHe is very ill,\u201d I answered. He looked at me in a most singular fashion. Had it not been too \ufb01endish, I could have imag-\nined that the gleam of the fanlight showed exulta-\ntion in his face. \u201cI heard some rumour of it,\u201d said he. The cab had driven up, and I left him. Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of \ufb01ne\nhouses lying in the vague borderland between\nNotting Hill and Kensington. The particular one\nat which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug\nand demure respectability in its old-fashioned iron\nrailings, its massive folding-door, and its shining\nbrasswork. All was in keeping with a solemn but-\nler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a\ntinted electrical light behind him. \u201cYes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in. Dr. Watson! Very good, sir, I will take up your card.\u201d\nMy humble name and title did not appear to\nimpress Mr. Culverton Smith. Through the half-\nopen door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating\nvoice. \u201cWho is this person? What does he want? Dear\nme, Staples, how often have I said that I am not to\nbe disturbed in my hours of study?\u201d\nThere came a gentle \ufb02ow of soothing explana-\ntion from the butler. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t see him, Staples. I can\u2019t have my\nwork interrupted like this. I am not at home. Say\nso. Tell him to come in the morning if he really\nmust see me.\u201d\nAgain the gentle murmur. \u201cWell, well, give him that message. He can\ncome in the morning, or he can stay away. My\nwork must not be hindered.\u201d\nI thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of\nsickness and counting the minutes, perhaps, un-\ntil I could bring help to him."

        "text": "It was not a time\nto stand upon ceremony. His life depended upon\nmy promptness. Before the apologetic butler had\ndelivered his message I had pushed past him and\nwas in the room. With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a\nreclining chair beside the \ufb01re. I saw a great yel-\nlow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with heavy,\ndouble-chin, and two sullen, menacing gray eyes\nwhich glared at me from under tufted and sandy\nbrows. A high bald head had a small velvet\nsmoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of\nits pink curve. The skull was of enormous capac-\nity, and yet as I looked down I saw to my amaze-\nment that the \ufb01gure of the man was small and frail,\ntwisted in the shoulders and back like one who has\nsuffered from rickets in his childhood. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he cried in a high, screaming\nvoice. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this intrusion? Didn\u2019t I send you word that I would see you to-\nmorrow morning?\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d said I, \u201cbut the matter cannot be\ndelayed. Mr. Sherlock Holmes\u2014\u201d\nThe mention of my friend\u2019s name had an ex-\ntraordinary effect upon the little man. The look\nof anger passed in an instant from his face. His\nfeatures became tense and alert. \u201cHave you come from Holmes?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have just left him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Holmes? How is he?\u201d\n\u201cHe is desperately ill.\nThat is why I have\ncome.\u201d\nThe man motioned me to a chair, and turned to\nresume his own. As he did so I caught a glimpse\nof his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece. I\ncould have sworn that it was set in a malicious and\nabominable smile. Yet I persuaded myself that it\nmust have been some nervous contraction which I\nhad surprised, for he turned to me an instant later\nwith genuine concern upon his features. \u201cI am sorry to hear this,\u201d said he. \u201cI only\nknow Mr. Holmes through some business dealings\nwhich we have had, but I have every respect for\nhis talents and his character. He is an amateur of\ncrime, as I am of disease. For him the villain, for\nme the microbe. There are my prisons,\u201d he con-\ntinued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which\n808\nThe Adventure of the Dying Detective\nstood upon a side table. \u201dAmong those gelatine\ncultivations some of the very worst offenders in\nthe world are now doing time.\u201d\n\u201cIt was on account of your special knowledge\nthat Mr. Holmes desired to see you. He has a high\nopinion of you and thought that you were the one\nman in London who could help him.\u201d\nThe little man started, and the jaunty smoking-\ncap slid to the \ufb02oor. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy should Mr. Homes\nthink that I could help him in his trouble?\u201d\n\u201cBecause of your knowledge of Eastern dis-\neases.\u201d\n\u201cBut why should he think that this disease\nwhich he has contracted is Eastern?\u201d\n\u201cBecause, in some professional inquiry, he has\nbeen working among Chinese sailors down in the\ndocks.\u201d\nMr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and\npicked up his smoking-cap."

How long has\nhe been ill?\u201d\n\u201cAbout three days.\u201d\n\u201cIs he delirious?\u201d\n\u201cOccasionally.\u201d\n\u201cTut, tut! This sounds serious. It would be in-\nhuman not to answer his call. I very much resent\nany interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but this\ncase is certainly exceptional. I will come with you\nat once.\u201d\nI remembered Holmes\u2019s injunction. \u201cI have another appointment,\u201d said I. \u201cVery good. I will go alone. I have a note of\nMr. Holmes\u2019s address. You can rely upon my be-\ning there within half an hour at most.\u201d\nIt was with a sinking heart that I reentered\nHolmes\u2019s bedroom. For all that I knew the worst\nmight have happened in my absence. To my enor-\nmous relief, he had improved greatly in the inter-\nval. His appearance was as ghastly as ever, but all\ntrace of delirium had left him and he spoke in a\nfeeble voice, it is true, but with even more than his\nusual crispness and lucidity. \u201cWell, did you see him, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cYes; he is coming.\u201d\n\u201cAdmirable, Watson! Admirable! You are the\nbest of messengers.\u201d\n\u201cHe wished to return with me.\u201d\n\u201cThat would never do, Watson. That would be\nobviously impossible. Did he ask what ailed me?\u201d\n\u201cI told him about the Chinese in the East End.\u201d\n\u201cExactly! Well, Watson, you have done all that\na good friend could. You can now disappear from\nthe scene.\u201d\n\u201cI must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you must. But I have reasons to\nsuppose that this opinion would be very much\nmore frank and valuable if he imagines that we\nare alone. There is just room behind the head of\nmy bed, Watson.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\n\u201cI fear there is no alternative, Watson. The\nroom does not lend itself to concealment, which\nis as well, as it is the less likely to arouse suspi-\ncion. But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could\nbe done.\u201d Suddenly he sat up with a rigid intent-\nness upon his haggard face. \u201cThere are the wheels,\nWatson. Quick, man, if you love me! And don\u2019t\nbudge, whatever happens\u2014whatever happens, do\nyou hear? Don\u2019t speak! Don\u2019t move! Just listen\nwith all your ears.\u201d Then in an instant his sud-\nden access of strength departed, and his masterful,\npurposeful talk droned away into the low, vague\nmurmurings of a semi-delirious man. From the hiding-place into which I had been\nso swiftly hustled I heard the footfalls upon the\nstair, with the opening and the closing of the bed-\nroom door. Then, to my surprise, there came a\nlong silence, broken only by the heavy breathings\nand gaspings of the sick man. I could imagine that\nour visitor was standing by the bedside and look-\ning down at the sufferer. At last that strange hush\nwas broken. \u201cHolmes!\u201d he cried. \u201cHolmes!\u201d in the insistent\ntone of one who awakens a sleeper. \u201dCan\u2019t you\nhear me, Holmes?\u201d There was a rustling, as if he\nhad shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder."

Think yourself smart, don\u2019t you? You came\nacross someone who was smarter this time. Now\ncast your mind back, Holmes.

        "text": "\u201cBravo, Watson! A very digni\ufb01ed and logical\nremonstrance. Let me see, what were the points? Take the last one \ufb01rst\u2014the cab. You observe that\nyou have some splashes on the left sleeve and\nshoulder of your coat. Had you sat in the cen-\ntre of a hansom you would probably have had no\nsplashes, and if you had they would certainly have\nbeen symmetrical. Therefore it is clear that you sat\nat the side. Therefore it is equally clear that you\nhad a companion.\u201d\n\u201cThat is very evident.\u201d\n\u201cAbsurdly commonplace, is it not?\u201d\n\u201cBut the boots and the bath?\u201d\n\u201cEqually childish. You are in the habit of doing\nup your boots in a certain way. I see them on this\noccasion fastened with an elaborate double bow,\nwhich is not your usual method of tying them. You\nhave, therefore, had them off. Who has tied them? A bootmaker\u2014or the boy at the bath. It is unlikely\nthat it is the bootmaker, since your boots are nearly\nnew. Well, what remains? The bath. Absurd, is it\nnot? But, for all that, the Turkish bath has served\na purpose.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\u201cYou say that you have had it because you need\na change. Let me suggest that you take one. How\nwould Lausanne do, my dear Watson\u2014\ufb01rst-class\ntickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?\u201d\n\u201cSplendid! But why?\u201d\nHolmes leaned back in his armchair and took\nhis notebook from his pocket. \u201cOne of the most dangerous classes in the\nworld,\u201d said he, \u201cis the drifting and friendless\nwoman. She is the most harmless and often the\nmost useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable in-\nciter of crime in others. She is helpless. She is mi-\ngratory. She has suf\ufb01cient means to take her from\ncountry to country and from hotel to hotel. She\nis lost, as often as not, in a maze of obscure pen-\nsions and boardinghouses. She is a stray chicken\nin a world of foxes. When she is gobbled up she\nis hardly missed. I much fear that some evil has\ncome to the Lady Frances Carfax.\u201d\nI was relieved at this sudden descent from the\ngeneral to the particular. Holmes consulted his\nnotes. \u201cLady Frances,\u201d he continued, \u201cis the sole sur-\nvivor of the direct family of the late Earl of Rufton. The estates went, as you may remember, in the\nmale line. She was left with limited means, but\nwith some very remarkable old Spanish jewellery\nof silver and curiously cut diamonds to which she\nwas fondly attached\u2014too attached, for she refused\nto leave them with her banker and always car-\nried them about with her. A rather pathetic \ufb01g-\nure, the Lady Frances, a beautiful woman, still in\nfresh middle age, and yet, by a strange change, the\nlast derelict of what only twenty years ago was a\ngoodly \ufb02eet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has happened to her, then?\u201d\n\u201cAh, what has happened to the Lady Frances? Is she alive or dead? There is our problem."

It is this\nMiss Dobney who has consulted me. Nearly \ufb01ve\nweeks have passed without a word. The last letter\nwas from the Hotel National at Lausanne. Lady\nFrances seems to have left there and given no ad-\ndress. The family are anxious, and as they are ex-\nceedingly wealthy no sum will be spared if we can\nclear the matter up.\u201d\n\u201cIs Miss Dobney the only source of informa-\ntion? Surely she had other correspondents?\u201d\n\u201cThere is one correspondent who is a sure\ndraw, Watson. That is the bank. Single ladies must\n815\nThe Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\nlive, and their passbooks are compressed diaries. She banks at Silvester\u2019s. I have glanced over her\naccount. The last check but one paid her bill at\nLausanne, but it was a large one and probably left\nher with cash in hand. Only one check has been\ndrawn since.\u201d\n\u201cTo whom, and where?\u201d\n\u201cTo Miss Marie Devine. There is nothing to\nshow where the check was drawn. It was cashed at\nthe Credit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than three\nweeks ago. The sum was \ufb01fty pounds.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who is Miss Marie Devine?\u201d\n\u201cThat also I have been able to discover. Miss\nMarie Devine was the maid of Lady Frances Car-\nfax. Why she should have paid her this check we\nhave not yet determined. I have no doubt, how-\never, that your researches will soon clear the mat-\nter up.\u201d\n\u201cMy researches!\u201d\n\u201cHence the health-giving expedition to Lau-\nsanne. You know that I cannot possibly leave Lon-\ndon while old Abrahams is in such mortal terror of\nhis life. Besides, on general principles it is best that\nI should not leave the country. Scotland Yard feels\nlonely without me, and it causes an unhealthy ex-\ncitement among the criminal classes. Go, then, my\ndear Watson, and if my humble counsel can ever\nbe valued at so extravagant a rate as two pence a\nword, it waits your disposal night and day at the\nend of the Continental wire.\u201d\nTwo days later found me at the Hotel National\nat Lausanne, where I received every courtesy at\nthe hands of M. Moser, the well-known manager. Lady Frances, as he informed me, had stayed there\nfor several weeks. She had been much liked by all\nwho met her. Her age was not more than forty. She was still handsome and bore every sign of\nhaving in her youth been a very lovely woman. M. Moser knew nothing of any valuable jewellery,\nbut it had been remarked by the servants that the\nheavy trunk in the lady\u2019s bedroom was always\nscrupulously locked. Marie Devine, the maid, was\nas popular as her mistress. She was actually en-\ngaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel, and\nthere was no dif\ufb01culty in getting her address."

        "text": "It\nwas 11 Rue de Trajan, Montpellier. All this I jotted\ndown and felt that Holmes himself could not have\nbeen more adroit in collecting his facts. Only one corner still remained in the shadow. No light which I possessed could clear up the\ncause for the lady\u2019s sudden departure. She was\nvery happy at Lausanne. There was every reason\nto believe that she intended to remain for the sea-\nson in her luxurious rooms overlooking the lake. And yet she had left at a single day\u2019s notice, which\ninvolved her in the useless payment of a week\u2019s\nrent. Only Jules Vibart, the lover of the maid, had\nany suggestion to offer. He connected the sud-\nden departure with the visit to the hotel a day\nor two before of a tall, dark, bearded man. \u201cUn\nsauvage\u2014un v\u00b4eritable sauvage!\u201d cried Jules Vibart. The man had rooms somewhere in the town. He\nhad been seen talking earnestly to Madame on the\npromenade by the lake. Then he had called. She\nhad refused to see him. He was English, but of his\nname there was no record. Madame had left the\nplace immediately afterwards. Jules Vibart, and,\nwhat was of more importance, Jules Vibart\u2019s sweet-\nheart, thought that this call and the departure were\ncause and effect. Only one thing Jules would not\ndiscuss. That was the reason why Marie had left\nher mistress. Of that he could or would say noth-\ning. If I wished to know, I must go to Montpellier\nand ask her. So ended the \ufb01rst chapter of my inquiry. The\nsecond was devoted to the place which Lady\nFrances Carfax had sought when she left Lau-\nsanne. Concerning this there had been some se-\ncrecy, which con\ufb01rmed the idea that she had gone\nwith the intention of throwing someone off her\ntrack. Otherwise why should not her luggage have\nbeen openly labelled for Baden? Both she and it\nreached the Rhenish spa by some circuitous route. This much I gathered from the manager of Cook\u2019s\nlocal of\ufb01ce. So to Baden I went, after dispatching\nto Holmes an account of all my proceedings and\nreceiving in reply a telegram of half-humorous\ncommendation. At Baden the track was not dif\ufb01cult to follow. Lady Frances had stayed at the Englischer Hof for\na fortnight. While there she had made the acquain-\ntance of a Dr. Shlessinger and his wife, a mission-\nary from South America. Like most lonely ladies,\nLady Frances found her comfort and occupation\nin religion. Dr. Shlessinger\u2019s remarkable personal-\nity, his whole hearted devotion, and the fact that\nhe was recovering from a disease contracted in the\nexercise of his apostolic duties affected her deeply. She had helped Mrs. Shlessinger in the nursing of\nthe convalescent saint. He spent his day, as the\nmanager described it to me, upon a lounge-chair\non the veranda, with an attendant lady upon either\nside of him. He was preparing a map of the Holy\nLand, with special reference to the kingdom of the\nMidianites, upon which he was writing a mono-\ngraph."

This\nwas just three weeks before, and the manager had\nheard nothing since. As to the maid, Marie, she\nhad gone off some days beforehand in \ufb02oods of\ntears, after informing the other maids that she was\nleaving service forever. Dr. Shlessinger had paid\nthe bill of the whole party before his departure. \u201cBy the way,\u201d said the landlord in conclusion,\n\u201cyou are not the only friend of Lady Frances Car-\nfax who is inquiring after her just now. Only a\nweek or so ago we had a man here upon the same\nerrand.\u201d\n\u201cDid he give a name?\u201d I asked. \u201cNone; but he was an Englishman, though of\nan unusual type.\u201d\n\u201cA savage?\u201d said I, linking my facts after the\nfashion of my illustrious friend. \u201cExactly. That describes him very well. He is a\nbulky, bearded, sunburned fellow, who looks as if\nhe would be more at home in a farmers\u2019 inn than\nin a fashionable hotel. A hard, \ufb01erce man, I should\nthink, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.\u201d\nAlready the mystery began to de\ufb01ne itself, as\n\ufb01gures grow clearer with the lifting of a fog. Here\nwas this good and pious lady pursued from place\nto place by a sinister and unrelenting \ufb01gure. She\nfeared him, or she would not have \ufb02ed from Lau-\nsanne. He had still followed. Sooner or later he\nwould overtake her. Had he already overtaken\nher? Was that the secret of her continued silence? Could the good people who were her companions\nnot screen her from his violence or his blackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay be-\nhind this long pursuit? There was the problem\nwhich I had to solve. To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and\nsurely I had got down to the roots of the matter. In reply I had a telegram asking for a description\nof Dr. Shlessinger\u2019s left ear. Holmes\u2019s ideas of hu-\nmour are strange and occasionally offensive, so I\ntook no notice of his ill-timed jest\u2014indeed, I had\nalready reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the\nmaid, Marie, before his message came. I had no dif\ufb01culty in \ufb01nding the ex-servant and\nin learning all that she could tell me. She was a\ndevoted creature, who had only left her mistress\nbecause she was sure that she was in good hands,\nand because her own approaching marriage made\na separation inevitable in any case. Her mistress\nhad, as she confessed with distress, shown some ir-\nritability of temper towards her during their stay in\nBaden, and had even questioned her once as if she\nhad suspicions of her honesty, and this had made\nthe parting easier than it would otherwise have\nbeen. Lady Frances had given her \ufb01fty pounds as\na wedding-present. Like me, Marie viewed with\ndeep distrust the stranger who had driven her mis-\ntress from Lausanne."

She had never spoken to Marie about it, but many\nlittle signs had convinced the maid that her mis-\ntress lived in a state of continual nervous appre-\nhension. So far she had got in her narrative, when\nsuddenly she sprang from her chair and her face\nwas convulsed with surprise and fear. \u201cSee!\u201d she\ncried. \u201cThe miscreant follows still!

Why have you\npursued her? I insist upon an answer!\u201d said I. The fellow gave a below of anger and sprang\nupon me like a tiger. I have held my own in many\na struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and the\nfury of a \ufb01end. His hand was on my throat and\nmy senses were nearly gone before an unshaven\nFrench ouvrier in a blue blouse darted out from\na cabaret opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and\nstruck my assailant a sharp crack over the forearm,\nwhich made him leave go his hold. He stood for an\ninstant fuming with rage and uncertain whether\nhe should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl\nof anger, he left me and entered the cottage from\nwhich I had just come. I turned to thank my pre-\nserver, who stood beside me in the roadway. \u201cWell, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201ca very pretty hash\nyou have made of it!

When the years had passed and I had made\nmy money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could\nseek her out and soften her. I had heard that she\nwas still unmarried, I found her at Lausanne and\ntried all I knew. She weakened, I think, but her\nwill was strong, and when next I called she had\nleft the town.

It was the woman who had opened\nit. But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me,\nand I think that she recognized me. I saw her start,\nand she hastily closed the door. I remembered my\npromise to you, and here I am.\u201d\n\u201cYou have done excellent work,\u201d said Holmes,\nscribbling a few words upon a half-sheet of paper. \u201cWe can do nothing legal without a warrant, and\nyou can serve the cause best by taking this note\ndown to the authorities and getting one. There\nmay be some dif\ufb01culty, but I should think that the\nsale of the jewellery should be suf\ufb01cient. Lestrade\nwill see to all details.\u201d\n\u201cBut they may murder her in the meanwhile. What could the cof\ufb01n mean, and for whom could\nit be but for her?\u201d\n\u201cWe will do all that can be done, Mr. Green. Not a moment will be lost. Leave it in our hands. Now Watson,\u201d he added as our client hurried\naway, \u201che will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as usual, the irregulars, and we must take\nour own line of action."

Not a moment is to be lost in getting to\nPoultney Square. \u201cLet us try to reconstruct the situation,\u201d said\nhe as we drove swiftly past the Houses of Parlia-\nment and over Westminster Bridge. \u201cThese villains\nhave coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after\n\ufb01rst alienating her from her faithful maid. If she\nhas written any letters they have been intercepted. Through some confederate they have engaged a\nfurnished house. Once inside it, they have made\nher a prisoner, and they have become possessed of\nthe valuable jewellery which has been their object\nfrom the \ufb01rst. Already they have begun to sell part\nof it, which seems safe enough to them, since they\nhave no reason to think that anyone is interested\nin the lady\u2019s fate. When she is released she will, of\ncourse, denounce them. Therefore, she must not\nbe released. But they cannot keep her under lock\nand key forever. So murder is their only solution.\u201d\n\u201cThat seems very clear.\u201d\n\u201cNow we will take another line of reasoning. When you follow two separate chains of thought,\nWatson, you will \ufb01nd some point of intersection\nwhich should approximate to the truth. We will\nstart now, not from the lady but from the cof-\n\ufb01n and argue backward. That incident proves,\nI fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead. It points also to an orthodox burial with proper\naccompaniment of medical certi\ufb01cate and of\ufb01cial\nsanction. Had the lady been obviously murdered,\nthey would have buried her in a hole in the back\ngarden. But here all is open and regular. What\ndoes this mean? Surely that they have done her to\ndeath in some way which has deceived the doctor\nand simulated a natural end\u2014poisoning, perhaps. And yet how strange that they should ever let a\ndoctor approach her unless he were a confederate,\nwhich is hardly a credible proposition.\u201d\n\u201cCould they have forged a medical certi\ufb01cate?\u201d\n\u201cDangerous, Watson, very dangerous. No, I\nhardly see them doing that. Pull up, cabby! This is\nevidently the undertaker\u2019s, for we have just passed\nthe pawnbroker\u2019s. Would go in, Watson? Your ap-\npearance inspires con\ufb01dence. Ask what hour the\nPoultney Square funeral takes place to-morrow.\u201d\nThe woman in the shop answered me without\nhesitation that it was to be at eight o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. \u201cYou see, Watson, no mystery; every-\nthing above-board! In some way the legal forms\nhave undoubtedly been complied with, and they\nthink that they have little to fear. Well, there\u2019s\nnothing for it now but a direct frontal attack. Are\nyou armed?\u201d\n\u201cMy stick!\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, we shall be strong enough. \u2018Thrice\nis he armed who hath his quarrel just.\u2019 We sim-\nply can\u2019t afford to wait for the police or to keep\nwithin the four corners of the law.

Now, Watson, we\u2019ll just take our luck\ntogether, as we have occasionally in the past.\u201d\n820\nThe Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\nHe had rung loudly at the door of a great\ndark house in the centre of Poultney Square."

Her words were literally true, for we had\nhardly time to look around the dusty and moth-\neaten apartment in which we found ourselves be-\nfore the door opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-\nheaded man stepped lightly into the room. He\nhad a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and\na general air of super\ufb01cial benevolence which was\nmarred by a cruel, vicious mouth. \u201cThere is surely some mistake here, gentle-\nmen,\u201d he said in an unctuous, make-everything-\neasy voice. \u201cI fancy that you have been misdi-\nrected.

She\nattached herself to Mrs. Peters and me at Baden\u2014it\nis a fact that I was using another name at the\ntime\u2014and she stuck on to us until we came to\nLondon.

First we drove to Brix-\nton Workhoused In\ufb01rmary, where we found that it\nwas indeed the truth that a charitable couple had\ncalled some days before, that they had claimed an\nimbecile old woman as a former servant, and that\nthey had obtained permission to take her away\nwith them. No surprise was expressed at the news\nthat she had since died. The doctor was our next goal. He had been\ncalled in, had found the woman dying of pure se-\nnility, had actually seen her pass away, and had\nsigned the certi\ufb01cate in due form. \u201cI assure you\nthat everything was perfectly normal and there\nwas no room for foul play in the matter,\u201d said he. Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious\nsave that for people of their class it was remark-\nable that they should have no servant. So far and\nno further went the doctor. Finally we found our way to Scotland Yard. There had been dif\ufb01culties of procedure in regard\nto the warrant. Some delay was inevitable. The\nmagistrate\u2019s signature might not be obtained un-\ntil next morning. If Holmes would call about nine\nhe could go down with Lestrade and see it acted\nupon. So ended the day, save that near midnight\nour friend, the sergeant, called to say that he had\nseen \ufb02ickering lights here and there in the win-\ndows of the great dark house, but that no one had\nleft it and none had entered. We could but pray\nfor patience and wait for the morrow. Sherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversa-\ntion and too restless for sleep. I left him smoking\nhard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted together,\nand his long, nervous \ufb01ngers tapping upon the\narms of his chair, as he turned over in his mind\nevery possible solution of the mystery. Several\ntimes in the course of the night I heard him prowl-\ning about the house."

Eight, was it not?\u201d\nhe asked eagerly. \u201cWell, it is 7.20 now. Good heav-\nens, Watson, what has become of any brains that\nGod has given me? Quick, man, quick! It\u2019s life or\ndeath\u2014a hundred chances on death to one on life. I\u2019ll never forgive myself, never, if we are too late!\u201d\nFive minutes had not passed before we were\n\ufb02ying in a hansom down Baker Street. But even\nso it was twenty-\ufb01ve to eight as we passed Big\nBen, and eight struck as we tore down the Brix-\nton Road. But others were late as well as we. Ten\nminutes after the hour the hearse was still standing\nat the door of the house, and even as our foaming\nhorse came to a halt the cof\ufb01n, supported by three\n822\nmen, appeared on the threshold. Holmes darted\nforward and barred their way. \u201cTake it back!\u201d he cried, laying his hand on the\nbreast of the foremost. \u201cTake it back this instant!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the devil do you mean?

Ah, that\ndoes it at last.\u201d\nWith a united effort we tore off the cof\ufb01n-\nlid. As we did so there came from the inside\na stupefying and overpowering smell of chloro-\nform. A body lay within, its head all wreathed\nin cotton-wool, which had been soaked in the nar-\ncotic. Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the stat-\nuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman\nof middle age. In an instant he had passed his arm\nround the \ufb01gure and raised her to a sitting posi-\ntion. \u201cIs she gone, Watson? Is there a spark left?

My night was haunted by the\nthought that somewhere a clue, a strange sentence,\na curious observation, had come under my notice\nand had been too easily dismissed. Then, sud-\ndenly, in the gray of the morning, the words came\nback to me. It was the remark of the undertaker\u2019s\nwife, as reported by Philip Green. She had said,\n\u2018It should be there before now. It took longer, be-\ning out of the ordinary.\u2019 It was the cof\ufb01n of which\nshe spoke. It had been out of the ordinary. That\ncould only mean that it had been made to some\nspecial measurement. But why? Why? Then in an\ninstant I remembered the deep sides, and the little\nwasted \ufb01gure at the bottom. Why so large a cof-\n\ufb01n for so small a body? To leave room for another\nbody. Both would be buried under the one certi\ufb01-\ncate. It had all been so clear, if only my own sight\nhad not been dimmed. At eight the Lady Frances\nwould be buried. Our one chance was to stop the\ncof\ufb01n before it left the house. \u201cIt was a desperate chance that we might \ufb01nd\nher alive, but it was a chance, as the result showed. These people had never, to my knowledge, done\na murder. They might shrink from actual violence\nat the last. The could bury her with no sign of\nhow she met her end, and even if she were ex-\nhumed there was a chance for them. I hoped that\nsuch considerations might prevail with them. You\ncan reconstruct the scene well enough. You saw\nthe horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady had\nbeen kept so long. They rushed in and overpow-\nered her with their chloroform, carried her down,\npoured more into the cof\ufb01n to insure against her\nwaking, and then screwed down the lid. A clever\ndevice, Watson.

It was\nindeed this attitude upon the part of my friend\nand certainly not any lack of interesting material\nwhich has caused me of late years to lay very few\nof my records before the public. My participation\nin some if his adventures was always a privilege\nwhich entailed discretion and reticence upon me. It was, then, with considerable surprise that I\nreceived a telegram from Homes last Tuesday\u2014he\nhas never been known to write where a telegram\nwould serve\u2014in the following terms:\nWhy not tell them of the Cornish hor-\nror\u2014strangest case I have handled. I have no idea what backward sweep of mem-\nory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or\nwhat freak had caused him to desire that I should\nrecount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling\ntelegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which\ngive me the exact details of the case and to lay the\nnarrative before my readers. It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that\nHolmes\u2019s iron constitution showed some symp-\ntoms of giving way in the face of constant hard\nwork of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps,\nby occasional indiscretions of his own. In March of\nthat year Dr. Moore Agar, of Harley Street, whose\ndramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day\nrecount, gave positive injunctions that the famous\nprivate agent lay aside all his cases and surrender\nhimself to complete rest if he wished to avert an\nabsolute breakdown. The state of his health was\nnot a matter in which he himself took the faintest\ninterest, for his mental detachment was absolute,\nbut he was induced at last, on the threat of being\npermanently disquali\ufb01ed from work, to give him-\nself a complete change of scene and air. Thus it\nwas that in the early spring of that year we found\nourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu\nBay, at the further extremity of the Cornish penin-\nsula. It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well\nsuited to the grim humour of my patient. From\nthe windows of our little whitewashed house,\nwhich stood high upon a grassy headland, we\nlooked down upon the whole sinister semicircle\nof Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing ves-\nsels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept\nreefs on which innumerable seamen have met their\nend. With a northerly breeze it lies placid and shel-\ntered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it\nfor rest and protection. Then come the sudden swirl round of the wind,\nthe blistering gale from the south-west, the drag-\nging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle in\nthe creaming breakers. The wise mariner stands\nfar out from that evil place."

In every direction upon these moors\nthere were traces of some vanished race which\nhad passed utterly away, and left as it sole record\nstrange monuments of stone, irregular mounds\nwhich contained the burned ashes of the dead,\nand curious earthworks which hinted at prehis-\ntoric strife.

He\nhad received a consignment of books upon philol-\nogy and was settling down to develop this thesis\nwhen suddenly, to my sorrow and to his unfeigned\ndelight, we found ourselves, even in that land\nof dreams, plunged into a problem at our very\ndoors which was more intense, more engrossing,\nand in\ufb01nitely more mysterious than any of those\nwhich had driven us from London. Our simple life\nand peaceful, healthy routine were violently inter-\nrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst\nof a series of events which caused the utmost ex-\ncitement not only in Cornwall but throughout the\nwhole west of England.

Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true\ndetails of this inconceivable affair to the public. I have said that scattered towers marked the\nvillages which dotted this part of Cornwall. The\nnearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick Wol-\nlas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred in-\nhabitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown\n827\nThe Adventure of the Devil\u2019s Foot\nchurch. The vicar of the parish, Mr. Roundhay,\nwas something of an archaeologist, and as such\nHolmes had made his acquaintance. He was a\nmiddle-aged man, portly and affable, with a con-\nsiderable fund of local lore. At his invitation we\nhad taken tea at the vicarage and had come to\nknow, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, an indepen-\ndent gentleman, who increased the clergyman\u2019s\nscanty resources by taking rooms in his large,\nstraggling house. The vicar, being a bachelor, was\nglad to come to such an arrangement, though he\nhad little in common with his lodger, who was\na thin, dark, spectacled man, with a stoop which\ngave the impression of actual, physical deformity. I remember that during our short visit we found\nthe vicar garrulous, but his lodger strangely reti-\ncent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with\naverted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own\naffairs."

It is the most unheard-\nof business. We can only regard it as a special\nProvidence that you should chance to be here at\nthe time, for in all England you are the one man\nwe need.\u201d\nI glared at the intrusive vicar with no very\nfriendly eyes; but Holmes took his pipe from his\nlips and sat up in his chair like an old hound who\nhears the view-halloa. He waved his hand to the\nsofa, and our palpitating visitor with his agitated\ncompanion sat side by side upon it. Mr. Mortimer\nTregennis was more self-contained than the cler-\ngyman, but the twitching of his thin hands and\nthe brightness of his dark eyes showed that they\nshared a common emotion. \u201cShall I speak or you?\u201d he asked of the vicar. \u201cWell, as you seem to have made the discov-\nery, whatever it may be, and the vicar to have\nhad it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the\nspeaking,\u201d said Holmes. I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with\nthe formally dressed lodger seated beside him,\nand was amused at the surprise which Holmes\u2019s\nsimple deduction had brought to their faces. \u201cPerhaps I had best say a few words \ufb01rst,\u201d said\nthe vicar, \u201cand then you can judge if you will lis-\nten to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or whether\nwe should not hasten at once to the scene of this\nmysterious affair. I may explain, then, that our\nfriend here spent last evening in the company of\nhis two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sis-\nter Brenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha,\nwhich is near the old stone cross upon the moor. He left them shortly after ten o\u2019clock, playing cards\nround the dining-room table, in excellent health\nand spirits. This morning, being an early riser, he\nwalked in that direction before breakfast and was\novertaken by the carriage of Dr. Richards, who ex-\nplained that he had just been sent for on a most\nurgent call to Tredannick Wartha. Mr. Mortimer\nTregennis naturally went with him. When he ar-\nrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordi-\nnary state of things. His two brothers and his sister\nwere seated round the table exactly as he had left\nthem, the cards still spread in front of them and\nthe candles burned down to their sockets. The sis-\nter lay back stone-dead in her chair, while the two\nbrothers sat on each side of her laughing, shouting,\nand singing, the senses stricken clean out of them. All three of them, the dead woman and the two de-\nmented men, retained upon their faces an expres-\nsion of the utmost horror\u2014a convulsion of terror\nwhich was dreadful to look upon."

Have you been there\nyourself, Mr. Roundhay?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mr. Holmes.

He sat with a pale, drawn face,\nhis anxious gaze \ufb01xed upon Holmes, and his thin\nhands clasped convulsively together. His pale lips\nquivered as he listened to the dreadful experience\nwhich had befallen his family, and his dark eyes\nseemed to re\ufb02ect something of the horror of the\nscene. \u201cAsk what you like, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he ea-\ngerly. \u201cIt is a bad thing to speak of, but I will\nanswer you the truth.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about last night.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar\nhas said, and my elder brother George proposed a\ngame of whist afterwards. We sat down about nine\no\u2019clock. It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to\ngo. I left them all round the table, as merry as\ncould be.\u201d\n\u201cWho let you out?\u201d\n\u201cMrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself\nout. I shut the hall door behind me. The window\nof the room in which they sat was closed, but the\nblind was not drawn down. There was no change\nin door or window this morning, or any reason to\nthink that any stranger had been to the house. Yet\nthere they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and\nBrenda lying dead of fright, with her head hang-\ning over the arm of the chair."

Yet we\nmust exhaust all natural explanations before we\nfall back upon such a theory as this. As to your-\nself, Mr. Tregennis, I take it you were divided in\nsome way from your family, since they lived to-\ngether and you had rooms apart?\u201d\n\u201cThat is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is\npast and done with. We were a family of tin-\nminers at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a\ncompany, and so retired with enough to keep us.

Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which\ncan help me.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing at all, sir.\u201d\n\u201cYour people were in their usual spirits?\u201d\n\u201cNever better.\u201d\n\u201cWere they nervous people?

I saw him once\nlook hard over my shoulder, so I turned round and\nlooked also. The blind was up and the window\nshut, but I could just make out the bushes on the\nlawn, and it seemed to me for a moment that I saw\nsomething moving among them. I couldn\u2019t even\nsay if it was man or animal, but I just thought there\nwas something there. When I asked him what he\nwas looking at, he told me that he had the same\nfeeling. That is all that I can say.\u201d\n\u201cDid you not investigate?\u201d\n\u201cNo; the matter passed as unimportant.\u201d\n\u201cYou left them, then, without any premonition\nof evil?\u201d\n\u201cNone at all.\u201d\n\u201cI am not clear how you came to hear the news\nso early this morning.\u201d\n\u201cI am an early riser and generally take a walk\nbefore breakfast.

The candles\nand the \ufb01re must have burned out hours before,\nand they had been sitting there in the dark until\ndawn had broken. The doctor said Brenda must\nhave been dead at least six hours. There were no\nsigns of violence. She just lay across the arm of the\nchair with that look on her face. George and Owen\nwere singing snatches of songs and gibbering like\n829\nThe Adventure of the Devil\u2019s Foot\ntwo great apes. Oh, it was awful to see! I couldn\u2019t\nstand it, and the doctor was as white as a sheet. Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and\nwe nearly had him on our hands as well.\u201d\n\u201cRemarkable\u2014most\nremarkable!\u201d\nsaid\nHolmes, rising and taking his hat. \u201cI think, per-\nhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha\nwithout further delay. I confess that I have seldom\nknown a case which at \ufb01rst sight presented a more\nsingular problem.\u201d\nOur proceedings of that \ufb01rst morning did little\nto advance the investigation. It was marked, how-\never, at the outset by an incident which left the\nmost sinister impression upon my mind. The ap-\nproach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is\ndown a narrow, winding, country lane. While we\nmade our way along it we heard the rattle of a car-\nriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it\npass. As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through\nthe closed window of a horribly contorted, grin-\nning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and\ngnashing teeth \ufb02ashed past us like a dreadful vi-\nsion. \u201cMy\nbrothers!\u201d\ncried\nMortimer\nTregennis,\nwhite to his lips. \u201cThey are taking them to Hel-\nston.\u201d\nWe looked with horror after the black carriage,\nlumbering upon its way. Then we turned our steps\ntowards this ill-omened house in which they had\nmet their strange fate. It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa\nthan a cottage, with a considerable garden which\nwas already, in that Cornish air, well \ufb01lled with\nspring \ufb02owers. Towards this garden the window\nof the sitting-room fronted, and from it, accord-\ning to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that\nthing of evil which had by sheer horror in a sin-\ngle instant blasted their minds. Holmes walked\nslowly and thoughtfully among the \ufb02ower-plots\nand along the path before we entered the porch. So\nabsorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that\nhe stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its con-\ntents, and deluged both our feet and the garden\npath. Inside the house we were met by the elderly\nCornish housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the\naid of a young girl, looked after the wants of the\nfamily. She readily answered all Holmes\u2019s ques-\ntions. She had heard nothing in the night. Her\nemployers had all been in excellent spirits lately,\nand she had never known them more cheerful and\nprosperous."

She had, when\nshe recovered, thrown open the window to let the\nmorning air in, and had run down to the lane,\nwhence she sent a farm-lad for the doctor. The\nlady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see\nher. It took four strong men to get the brothers into\nthe asylum carriage. She would not herself stay in\nthe house another day and was starting that very\nafternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives. We ascended the stairs and viewed the body. Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a very beautiful\ngirl, though now verging upon middle age. Her\ndark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death,\nbut there still lingered upon it something of that\nconvulsion of horror which had been her last hu-\nman emotion. From her bedroom we descended\nto the sitting-room, where this strange tragedy\nhad actually occurred. The charred ashes of the\novernight \ufb01re lay in the grate. On the table were\nthe four guttered and burned-out candles, with the\ncards scattered over its surface. The chairs had\nbeen moved back against the walls, but all else was\nas it had been the night before. Holmes paced with\nlight, swift steps about the room; he sat in the var-\nious chairs, drawing them up and reconstructing\ntheir positions. He tested how much of the garden\nwas visible; he examined the \ufb02oor, the ceiling, and\nthe \ufb01replace; but never once did I see that sud-\nden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his\nlips which would have told me that he saw some\ngleam of light in this utter darkness. \u201cWhy a \ufb01re?\u201d he asked once. \u201cHad they always\na \ufb01re in this small room on a spring evening?\u201d\nMortimer Tregennis explained that the night\nwas cold and damp. For that reason, after his ar-\nrival, the \ufb01re was lit. \u201cWhat are you going to do\nnow, Mr. Holmes?\u201d he asked. My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my\narm. \u201cI think, Watson, that I shall resume that\ncourse of tobacco-poisoning which you have so of-\nten and so justly condemned,\u201d said he. \u201cWith your\npermission, gentlemen, we will now return to our\ncottage, for I am not aware that any new factor is\nlikely to come to our notice here. I will turn the\nfacts over in my mid, Mr, Tregennis, and should\nanything occur to me I will certainly ommunicate\nwith you and the vicar. In the meantime I wish\nyou both good-morning.\u201d\nIt was not until long after we were back in\nPoldhu Cottage that Holmes broke his complete\nand absorbed silence. He sat coiled in his arm-\nchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible\namid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black\nbrows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his\neyes vacant and far away. Finally he laid down his\npipe and sprang to his feet."

We are more likely to \ufb01nd them\nthan clues to this problem. To let the brain work\nwithout suf\ufb01cient material is like racing an engine. It racks itself to pieces. The sea air, sunshine, and\npatience, Watson\u2014all else will come. \u201cNow, let us calmly de\ufb01ne our position, Wat-\nson,\u201d he continued as we skirted the cliffs together. \u201cLet us get a \ufb01rm grip of the very little which we\ndo know, so that when fresh facts arise we may\nbe ready to \ufb01t them into their places. I take it,\nin the \ufb01rst place, that neither of us is prepared\nto admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of\nmen. Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of\nour minds. Very good. There remain three per-\nsons who have been grievously stricken by some\nconscious or unconscious human agency. That is\n\ufb01rm ground. Now, when did this occur? Evi-\ndently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was\nimmediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left\nthe room. That is a very important point. The pre-\nsumption is that it was within a few minutes after-\nwards. The cards still lay upon the table. It was\nalready past their usual hour for bed. Yet they had\nnot changed their position or pushed back their\nchairs. I repeat, then, that the occurrence was im-\nmediately after his departure, and not later than\neleven o\u2019clock last night. \u201cOur next obvious step is to check, so far as\nwe can, the movements of Mortimer Tregennis af-\nter he left the room. In this there is no dif\ufb01culty,\nand they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing\nmy methods as you do, you were, of course, con-\nscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot expedi-\nent by which I obtained a clearer impress of his\nfoot than might otherwise have been possible. The\nwet, sandy path took it admirably. Last night was\nalso wet, you will remember, and it was not dif\ufb01-\ncult\u2014having obtained a sample print\u2014to pick out\nhis track among others and to follow his move-\nments. He appears to have walked away swiftly in\nthe direction of the vicarage. \u201cIf,\nthen,\nMortimer Tregennis disappeared\nfrom the scene, and yet some outside person af-\nfected the card-players, how can we reconstruct\nthat person, and how was such an impression of\nhorror conveyed? Mrs. Porter may be eliminated. She is evidently harmless. Is there any evidence\nthat someone crept up to the garden window and\nin some manner produced so terri\ufb01c an effect that\nhe drove those who saw it out of their senses? The\nonly suggestion in this direction comes from Mor-\ntimer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother\nspoke about some movement in the garden. That\nis certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,\ncloudy, and dark. Anyone who had the design to\nalarm these people would be compelled to place\nhis very face against the glass before he could be\nseen."

The huge body, the craggy and deeply\nseamed face with the \ufb01erce eyes and hawk-like\nnose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our\ncottage ceiling, the beard\u2014golden at the fringes\nand white near the lips, save for the nicotine stain\nfrom his perpetual cigar\u2014all these were as well\nknown in London as in Africa, and could only be\nassociated with the tremendous personality of Dr.\nLeon Sterndale, the great lion-hunter and explorer.

We had\narrived before the doctor or the police, so that ev-\nerything was absolutely undisturbed. Let me de-\nscribe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that\nmisty March morning. It has left an impression\nwhich can never be effaced from my mind. The atmosphere of the room was of a horri-\nble and depressing stuf\ufb01ness. The servant who\nhad \ufb01rst entered had thrown up the window, or\nit would have been even more intolerable. This\nmight partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood\n\ufb02aring and smoking on the centre table. Beside\nit sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his\nthin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on\nto his forehead, and his lean dark face turned to-\nwards the window and twisted into the same dis-\ntortion of terror which had marked the features of\nhis dead sister. His limbs were convulsed and his\n\ufb01ngers contorted as though he had died in a very\nparoxysm of fear. He was fully clothed, though\nthere were signs that his dressing had been done in\na hurry. We had already learned that his bed had\nbeen slept in, and that the tragic end had come to\nhim in the early morning. One realized the red-hot energy which under-\nlay Holmes\u2019s phlegmatic exterior when one saw\nthe sudden change which came over him from the\nmoment that he entered the fatal apartment. In\nan instant he was tense and alert, his eyes shining,\nhis face set, his limbs quivering with eager activity. He was out on the lawn, in through the window,\nround the room, and up into the bedroom, for\nall the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a\ncover. In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around\nand ended by throwing open the window, which\nappeared to give him some fresh cause for excite-\nment, for he leaned out of it with loud ejaculations\nof interest and delight."

The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he\nexamined with minute care, making certain mea-\nsurements upon its bowl. He carefully scrutinized\nwith his lens the talc shield which covered the top\nof the chimney and scraped off some ashes which\nadhered to its upper surface, putting some of them\ninto an envelope, which he placed in his pocket-\nbook. Finally, just as the doctor and the of\ufb01cial\npolice put in an appearance, he beckoned to the\nvicar and we all three went out upon the lawn. \u201cI am glad to say that my investigation has not\nbeen entirely barren,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI cannot re-\nmain to discuss the matter with the police, but I\nshould be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if\nyou would give the inspector my compliments and\ndirect his attention to the bedroom window and\nto the sitting-room lamp. Each is suggestive, and\ntogether they are almost conclusive. If the police\nwould desire further information I shall be happy\nto see any of them at the cottage. And now, Wat-\nson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better em-\nployed elsewhere.\u201d\nIt may be that the police resented the intrusion\nof an amateur, or that they imagined themselves\nto be upon some hopeful line of investigation; but\nit is certain that we heard nothing from them for\nthe next two days. During this time Holmes spent\nsome of his time smoking and dreaming in the cot-\ntage; but a greater portion in country walks which\nhe undertook alone, returning after many hours\nwithout remark as to where he had been. One ex-\nperiment served to show me the line of his investi-\ngation. He had bought a lamp which was the du-\nplicate of the one which had burned in the room of\nMortimer Tregennis on the morning of the tragedy. This he \ufb01lled with the same oil as that used at the\nvicarage, and he carefully timed the period which\nit would take to be exhausted. Another experiment\nwhich he made was of a more unpleasant nature,\nand one which I am not likely ever to forget. \u201cYou will remember, Watson,\u201d he remarked\none afternoon, \u201cthat there is a single common\npoint of resemblance in the varying reports which\nhave reached us. This concerns the effect of the\natmosphere of the room in each case upon those\nwho had \ufb01rst entered it. You will recollect that\nMortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of\nhis last visit to his brother\u2019s house, remarked\nthat the doctor on entering the room fell into a\nchair? You had forgotten? Well I can answer for\nit that it was so. Now, you will remember also\nthat Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she\nherself fainted upon entering the room and had\nafterwards opened the window."

        "text": "In the second\ncase\u2014that of Mortimer Tregennis himself\u2014you\ncannot have forgotten the horrible stuf\ufb01ness of the\nroom when we arrived, though the servant had\nthrown open the window. That servant, I found\nupon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her\nbed. You will admit, Watson, that these facts are\nvery suggestive. In each case there is evidence of a\npoisonous atmosphere. In each case, also, there is\ncombustion going on in the room\u2014in the one case\na \ufb01re, in the other a lamp. The \ufb01re was needed,\nbut the lamp was lit\u2014as a comparison of the oil\nconsumed will show\u2014long after it was broad day-\nlight. Why? Surely because there is some connec-\n833\nThe Adventure of the Devil\u2019s Foot\ntion between three things\u2014the burning, the stuffy\natmosphere, and, \ufb01nally, the madness or death of\nthose unfortunate people. That is clear, is it not?\u201d\n\u201cIt would appear so.\u201d\n\u201cAt least we may accept it as a working hy-\npothesis. We will suppose, then, that something\nwas burned in each case which produced an at-\nmosphere causing strange toxic effects. Very good. In the \ufb01rst instance\u2014that of the Tregennis fam-\nily\u2014this substance was placed in the \ufb01re. Now\nthe window was shut, but the \ufb01re would naturally\ncarry fumes to some extent up the chimney. Hence\none would expect the effects of the poison to be\nless than in the second case, where there was less\nescape for the vapour. The result seems to indi-\ncate that it was so, since in the \ufb01rst case only the\nwoman, who had presumably the more sensitive\norganism, was killed, the others exhibiting that\ntemporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently\nthe \ufb01rst effect of the drug. In the second case the\nresult was complete. The facts, therefore, seem to\nbear out the theory of a poison which worked by\ncombustion. \u201cWith this train of reasoning in my head I nat-\nurally looked about in Mortimer Tregennis\u2019s room\nto \ufb01nd some remains of this substance. The ob-\nvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-\nguard of the lamp. There, sure enough, I perceived\na number of \ufb02aky ashes, and round the edges a\nfringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been\nconsumed. Half of this I took, as you saw, and I\nplaced it in an envelope.\u201d\n\u201cWhy half, Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cIt is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in\nthe way of the of\ufb01cial police force. I leave them\nall the evidence which I found. The poison still\nremained upon the talc had they the wit to \ufb01nd\nit. Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will,\nhowever, take the precaution to open our window\nto avoid the premature decease of two deserving\nmembers of society, and you will seat yourself near\nthat open window in an armchair unless, like a\nsensible man, you determine to have nothing to\ndo with the affair. Oh, you will see it out, will\nyou? I thought I knew my Watson."

Each is now in a posi-\ntion to watch the other and to bring the experiment\nto an end should the symptoms seem alarming. Is\nthat all clear? Well, then, I take our powder\u2014or\nwhat remains of it\u2014from the envelope, and I lay it\nabove the burning lamp. So! Now, Watson, let us\nsit down and await developments.\u201d\nThey were not long in coming. I had hardly set-\ntled in my chair before I was conscious of a thick,\nmusky odour, subtle and nauseous. At the very\n\ufb01rst whiff of it my brain and my imagination were\nbeyond all control. A thick, black cloud swirled\nbefore my eyes, and my mind told me that in this\ncloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon\nmy appalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely\nhorrible, all that was monstrous and inconceivably\nwicked in the universe. Vague shapes swirled and\nswam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace\nand a warning of something coming, the advent\nof some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold,\nwhose very shadow would blast my soul. A freez-\ning horror took possession of me. I felt that my\nhair was rising, that my eyes were protruding,\nthat my mouth was opened, and my tongue like\nleather. The turmoil within my brain was such that\nsomething must surely snap. I tried to scream and\nwas vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which\nwas my own voice, but distant and detached from\nmyself. At the same moment, in some effort of\nescape, I broke through that cloud of despair and\nhad a glimpse of Holmes\u2019s face, white, rigid, and\ndrawn with horror\u2014the very look which I had\nseen upon the features of the dead. It was that\nvision which gave me an instant of sanity and of\nstrength. I dashed from my chair, threw my arms\nround Holmes, and together we lurched through\nthe door, and an instant afterwards had thrown\nourselves down upon the grass plot and were ly-\ning side by side, conscious only of the glorious\nsunshine which was bursting its way through the\nhellish cloud of terror which had girt us in. Slowly\nit rose from our souls like the mists from a land-\nscape until peace and reason had returned, and we\nwere sitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy\nforeheads, and looking with apprehension at each\nother to mark the last traces of that terri\ufb01c experi-\nence which we had undergone. \u201cUpon my word, Watson!\u201d said Holmes at\nlast with an unsteady voice, \u201cI owe you both my\nthanks and an apology. It was an unjusti\ufb01able ex-\nperiment even for one\u2019s self, and doubly so for a\nfriend. I am really very sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d I answered with some emotion,\nfor I have never seen so much of Holmes\u2019s heart\nbefore, \u201cthat it is my greatest joy and privilege to\nhelp you.\u201d\nHe relapsed at once into the half-humorous,\nhalf-cynical vein which was his habitual attitude\nto those about him."

I confess that I never imagined that\nthe effect could be so sudden and so severe.\u201d He\ndashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the\nburning lamp held at full arm\u2019s length, he threw\nit among a bank of brambles. \u201cWe must give the\nroom a little time to clear. I take it, Watson, that\nyou have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how\nthese tragedies were produced?\u201d\n\u201cNone whatever.\u201d\n\u201cBut the cause remains as obscure as before. Come into the arbour here and let us discuss it to-\ngether. That villainous stuff seems still to linger\nround my throat. I think we must admit that all\nthe evidence points to this man, Mortimer Tregen-\nnis, having been the criminal in the \ufb01rst tragedy,\nthough he was the victim in the second one. We\nmust remember, in the \ufb01rst place, that there is\nsome story of a family quarrel, followed by a rec-\nonciliation. How bitter that quarrel may have been,\nor how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell. When I think of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy\nface and the small shrewd, beady eyes behind the\nspectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge\nto be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well,\nin the next place, you will remember that this idea\nof someone moving in the garden, which took our\nattention for a moment from the real cause of the\ntragedy, emanated from him. He had a motive in\nmisleading us. Finally, if he did not throw the sub-\nstance into the \ufb01re at the moment of leaving the\nroom, who did do so? The affair happened imme-\ndiately after his departure. Had anyone else come\nin, the family would certainly have risen from the\ntable. Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did\nnot arrive after ten o\u2019clock at night. We may take\nit, then, that all the evidence points to Mortimer\nTregennis as the culprit.\u201d\n\u201cThen his own death was suicide!\u201d\n\u201cWell, Watson, it is on the face of it a not im-\npossible supposition. The man who had the guilt\nupon his soul of having brought such a fate upon\nhis own family might well be driven by remorse to\nin\ufb02ict it upon himself. There are, however, some\ncogent reasons against it. Fortunately, there is one\nman in England who knows all about it, and I have\nmade arrangements by which we shall hear the\nfacts this afternoon from his own lips. Ah! he is\na little before his time. Perhaps you would kindly\nstep this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been\nconducing a chemical experiment indoors which\nhas left our little room hardly \ufb01t for the reception\nof so distinguished a visitor.\u201d\nI had heard the click of the garden gate, and\nnow the majestic \ufb01gure of the great African ex-\nplorer appeared upon the path."

You were wear-\ning, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed tennis\nshoes which are at the present moment upon your\nfeet. At the vicarage you passed through the or-\nchard and the side hedge, coming out under the\nwindow of the lodger Tregennis. It was now day-\nlight, but the household was not yet stirring. You\ndrew some of the gravel from your pocket, and\nyou threw it up at the window above you.\u201d\nSterndale sprang to his feet. \u201cI believe that you are the devil himself!\u201d he\ncried.

He dressed hurriedly and descended to his\nsitting-room. You entered by the window. There\nwas an interview\u2014a short one\u2014during which you\nwalked up and down the room. Then you passed\nout and closed the window, standing on the lawn\noutside smoking a cigar and watching what oc-\ncurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you\nwithdrew as you had come. Now, Dr. Sterndale,\nhow do you justify such conduct, and what were\nthe motives for your actions?

I told him also how powerless Euro-\npean science would be to detect it. How he took\nit I cannot say, for I never left the room, but there\nis no doubt that it was then, while I was opening\ncabinets and stooping to boxes, that he managed\nto abstract some of the devil\u2019s-foot root.

As I have already said, there is no man living\nwho can fear death less than I do.\u201d\n837\nHolmes sat for some little time in silence. \u201cWhat were your plans?\u201d he asked at last. \u201cI had intended to bury myself in central\nAfrica. My work there is but half \ufb01nished.\u201d\n\u201cGo and do the other half,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI, at\nleast, am not prepared to prevent you.\u201d\nDr. Sterndale raised his giant \ufb01gure, bowed\ngravely, and walked from the arbour. Holmes lit\nhis pipe and handed me his pouch. \u201cSome fumes which are not poisonous would\nbe a welcome change,\u201d said he. \u201cI think you must\nagree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we\nare called upon to interfere. Our investigation has\nbeen independent, and our action shall be so also. You would not denounce the man?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d I answered. \u201cI have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if\nthe woman I loved had met such an end, I might\nact even as our lawless lion-hunter has done. Who\nknows? Well, Watson, I will not offend your intel-\nligence by explaining what is obvious. The gravel\nupon the window-sill was, of course, the starting-\npoint of my research. It was unlike anything in\nthe vicarage garden. Only when my attention\nhad been drawn to Dr. Sterndale and his cottage\ndid I \ufb01nd its counterpart. The lamp shining in\nbroad daylight and the remains of powder upon\nthe shield were successive links in a fairly obvi-\nous chain. And now, my dear Watson, I think\nwe may dismiss the matter from our mind and go\nback with a clear conscience to the study of those\nChaldean roots which are surely to be traced in the\nCornish branch of the great Celtic speech.\u201d\nHis Last Bow\nAn Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes\nHis Last Bow\nI\nt was nine o\u2019clock at night upon the sec-\nond of August\u2014the most terrible August\nin the history of the world."

The sun\nhad long set, but one blood-red gash like an open\nwound lay low in the distant west. Above, the stars\nwere shining brightly, and below, the lights of the\nshipping glimmered in the bay. The two famous\nGermans stood beside the stone parapet of the gar-\nden walk, with the long, low, heavily gabled house\nbehind them, and they looked down upon the\nbroad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great\nchalk cliff in which Von Bork, like some wander-\ning eagle, had perched himself four years before. They stood with their heads close together, talk-\ning in low, con\ufb01dential tones. From below the two\nglowing ends of their cigars might have been the\nsmouldering eyes of some malignant \ufb01end looking\ndown in the darkness. A remarkable man this Von Bork\u2014a man who\ncould hardly be matched among all the devoted\nagents of the Kaiser. It was his talents which had\n\ufb01rst recommended him for the English mission,\nthe most important mission of all, but since he\nhad taken it over those talents had become more\nand more manifest to the half-dozen people in the\nworld who were really in touch with the truth. One of these was his present companion, Baron\nVon Herling, the chief secretary of the legation,\nwhose huge 100-horse-power Benz car was block-\ning the country lane as it waited to waft its owner\nback to London. \u201cSo far as I can judge the trend of events, you\nwill probably be back in Berlin within the week,\u201d\nthe secretary was saying. \u201cWhen you get there, my\ndear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at the\nwelcome you will receive. I happen to know what\nis thought in the highest quarters of your work in\nthis country.\u201d He was a huge man, the secretary,\ndeep, broad, and tall, with a slow, heavy fashion\nof speech which had been his main asset in his po-\nlitical career. Von Bork laughed. \u201cThey are not very hard to deceive,\u201d he re-\nmarked. \u201cA more docile, simple folk could not\nbe imagined.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d said the other\nthoughtfully. \u201cThey have strange limits and one\nmust learn to observe them. It is that surface\nsimplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the\nstranger. One\u2019s \ufb01rst impression is that they are en-\ntirely soft. Then one comes suddenly upon some-\nthing very hard, and you know that you have\nreached the limit and must adapt yourself to the\nfact. They have, for example, their insular conven-\ntions which simply must be observed.\u201d\n\u201cMeaning \u2018good form\u2019 and that sort of thing?\u201d\nVon Bork sighed as one who had suffered much. \u201cMeaning British prejudice in all its queer man-\nifestations. As an example I may quote one of my\nown worst blunders\u2014I can afford to talk of my\nblunders, for you know my work well enough to\nbe aware of my successes."

Unfortunately our good\nchancellor is a little heavy-handed in these mat-\nters, and he transmitted a remark which showed\nthat he was aware of what had been said. This, of\ncourse, took the trail straight up to me. You\u2019ve no\nidea the harm that it did me. There was nothing\nsoft about our British hosts on that occasion, I can\nassure you. I was two years living it down. Now\nyou, with this sporting pose of yours\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t call it a pose. A pose is an ar-\nti\ufb01cial thing. This is quite natural.

Only when all these\nprecautions had been taken and tested did he turn\nhis sunburned aquiline face to his guest. \u201cSome of my papers have gone,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen my wife and the household left yester-\nday for Flushing they took the less important with\nthem. I must, of course, claim the protection of the\nembassy for the others.\u201d\n\u201cYour name has already been \ufb01led as one of the\npersonal suite. There will be no dif\ufb01culties for you\nor your baggage. Of course, it is just possible that\nwe may not have to go. England may leave France\nto her fate. We are sure that there is no binding\ntreaty between them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Belgium?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and Belgium, too.\u201d\nVon Bork shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t see how that\ncould be. There is a de\ufb01nite treaty there. She could\nnever recover from such a humiliation.\u201d\n\u201cShe would at least have peace for the mo-\nment.\u201d\n\u201cBut her honor?\u201d\n\u201cTut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age."

She was bending over her knitting\nand stopping occasionally to stroke a large black\ncat upon a stool beside her. \u201cThat is Martha, the only servant I have left.\u201d\nThe secretary chuckled. \u201cShe might almost personify Britannia,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cwith her complete self-absorption and general\nair of comfortable somnolence. Well, au revoir, Von\nBork!\u201d With a \ufb01nal wave of his hand he sprang\ninto the car, and a moment later the two golden\ncones from the headlights shot through the dark-\nness. The secretary lay back in the cushions of the\nluxurious limousine, with his thoughts so full of\nthe impending European tragedy that he hardly\nobserved that as his car swung round the village\nstreet it nearly passed over a little Ford coming in\nthe opposite direction. Von Bork walked slowly back to the study\nwhen the last gleams of the motor lamps had\nfaded into the distance. As he passed he observed\nthat his old housekeeper had put out her lamp and\nretired. It was a new experience to him, the silence\nand darkness of his widespread house, for his fam-\nily and household had been a large one. It was a\nrelief to him, however, to think that they were all\nin safety and that, but for that one old woman who\nhad lingered in the kitchen, he had the whole place\nto himself. There was a good deal of tidying up to\ndo inside his study and he set himself to do it until\nhis keen, handsome face was \ufb02ushed with the heat\nof the burning papers. A leather valise stood be-\nside his table, and into this he began to pack very\nneatly and systematically the precious contents of\nhis safe. He had hardly got started with the work,\nhowever, when his quick ears caught the sounds of\na distant car. Instantly he gave an exclamation of\nsatisfaction, strapped up the valise, shut the safe,\nlocked it, and hurried out on to the terrace. He\nwas just in time to see the lights of a small car\ncome to a halt at the gate. A passenger sprang\nout of it and advanced swiftly towards him, while\nthe chauffeur, a heavily built, elderly man with a\ngray moustache, settled down like one who resigns\nhimself to a long vigil. \u201cWell?\u201d asked Von Bork eagerly, running for-\nward to meet his visitor. For answer the man waved a small brown-\npaper parcel triumphantly above his head. \u201cYou can give me the glad hand to-night, mis-\nter,\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019m bringing home the bacon at\nlast.\u201d\n\u201cThe signals?\u201d\n843\nHis Last Bow\n\u201cSame as I said in my cable.

The reward. The \u00a3500. The gun-\nner turned damned nasty at the last, and I had\nto square him with an extra hundred dollars or it\nwould have been nitsky for you and me. \u2018Nothin\u2019\ndoin\u2019!\u2019 says he, and he meant it, too, but the last\nhundred did it. It\u2019s cost me two hundred pound\nfrom \ufb01rst to last, so it isn\u2019t likely I\u2019d give it up\nwithout gettin\u2019 my wad.\u201d\nVon Bork smiled with some bitterness. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t seem to have a very high opinion of my hon-\nour,\u201d said he, \u201cyou want the money before you\ngive up the book.\u201d\n\u201cWell, mister, it is a business proposition.\u201d\n\u201cAll right. Have your way.\u201d He sat down at the\ntable and scribbled a check, which he tore from\nthe book, but he refrained from handing it to his\ncompanion. \u201cAfter all, since we are to be on such\nterms, Mr. Altamont,\u201d said he, \u201cI don\u2019t see why I\nshould trust you any more than you trust me. Do\nyou understand?\u201d he added, looking back over his\nshoulder at the American. \u201cThere\u2019s the check upon\nthe table. I claim the right to examine that parcel\nbefore you pick the money up.\u201d\nThe American passed it over without a word. Von Bork undid a winding of string and two wrap-\npers of paper. Then he sat dazing for a moment\nin silent amazement at a small blue book which\nlay before him. Across the cover was printed\nin golden letters Practical Handbook of Bee Culture. Only for one instant did the master spy glare at\nthis strangely irrelevant inscription. The next he\nwas gripped at the back of his neck by a grasp of\niron, and a chloroformed sponge was held in front\nof his writhing face. \u201cAnother glass, Watson!\u201d said Mr. Sherlock\nHolmes as he extended the bottle of Imperial\nTokay. The thickset chauffeur, who had seated himself\nby the table, pushed forward his glass with some\neagerness. \u201cIt is a good wine, Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cA remarkable wine, Watson. Our friend upon\nthe sofa has assured me that it is from Franz Josef\u2019s\nspecial cellar at the Schoenbrunn Palace. Might I\ntrouble you to open the window, for chloroform\nvapour does not help the palate.\u201d\nThe safe was ajar, and Holmes standing in front\nof it was removing dossier after dossier, swiftly ex-\namining each, and then packing it neatly in Von\nBork\u2019s valise. The German lay upon the sofa sleep-\ning stertorously with a strap round his upper arms\nand another round his legs. \u201cWe need not hurry ourselves, Watson. We are\nsafe from interruption. Would you mind touching\nthe bell? There is no one in the house except old\nMartha, who has played her part to admiration. I\ngot her the situation here when \ufb01rst I took the mat-\nter up."

These papers,\u201d he contin-\nued as the old lady vanished, \u201care not of very\ngreat importance, for, of course, the information\nwhich they represent has been sent off long ago to\nthe German government.

It\nwould brighten my declining years to see a Ger-\nman cruiser navigating the Solent according to the\nmine-\ufb01eld plans which I have furnished. But you,\nWatson\u201d\u2014he stopped his work and took his old\nfriend by the shoulders\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve hardly seen you in\nthe light yet. How have the years used you?

But\nyou, Holmes\u2014you have changed very little\u2014save\nfor that horrible goatee.\u201d\n\u201cThese are the sacri\ufb01ces one makes for one\u2019s\ncountry, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, pulling at his little\ntuft. \u201cTo-morrow it will be but a dreadful mem-\nory.

Here is the fruit of my\nleisured ease, the magnum opus of my latter years!\u201d\nHe picked up the volume from the table and read\nout the whole title, Practical Handbook of Bee Cul-\nture, with Some Observations upon the Segregation of\nthe Queen. \u201cAlone I did it. Behold the fruit of pen-\nsive nights and laborious days when I watched the\nlittle working gangs as once I watched the criminal\nworld of London.\u201d\n\u201cBut how did you get to work again?\u201d\n\u201cAh, I have often marvelled at it myself. The\nForeign Minister alone I could have withstood, but\nwhen the Premier also deigned to visit my humble\nroof\u2014! The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman\nupon the sofa was a bit too good for our people. He was in a class by himself. Things were going\nwrong, and no one could understand why they\nwere going wrong. Agents were suspected or even\ncaught, but there was evidence of some strong and\nsecret central force. It was absolutely necessary to\nexpose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me\nto look into the matter. It has cost me two years,\nWatson, but they have not been devoid of excite-\nment. When I say that I started my pilgrimage\nat Chicago, graduated in an Irish secret society at\nBuffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at\nSkibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a\nsubordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended\nme as a likely man, you will realize that the matter\nwas complex. Since then I have been honoured by\nhis con\ufb01dence, which has not prevented most of\nhis plans going subtly wrong and \ufb01ve of his best\nagents being in prison. I watched them, Watson,\nand I picked them as they ripened. Well, sir, I hope\nthat you are none the worse!\u201d\nThe last remark was addressed to Von Bork\nhimself, who after much gasping and blinking\nhad lain quietly listening to Holmes\u2019s statement. He broke out now into a furious stream of Ger-\nman invective, his face convulsed with passion. Holmes continued his swift investigation of doc-\numents while his prisoner cursed and swore. \u201cThough unmusical, German is the most ex-\npressive of all languages,\u201d he observed when Von\nBork had stopped from pure exhaustion. \u201cHullo! Hullo!\u201d he added as he looked hard at the cor-\nner of a tracing before putting it in the box. \u201cThis\nshould put another bird in the cage. I had no\nidea that the paymaster was such a rascal, though\n846\nHis Last Bow\nI have long had an eye upon him. Mister Von Bork,\nyou have a great deal to answer for.\u201d\nThe prisoner had raised himself with some\ndif\ufb01culty upon the sofa and was staring with a\nstrange mixture of amazement and hatred at his\ncaptor. \u201cI shall get level with you, Altamont,\u201d he said,\nspeaking with slow deliberation."

It was a\nfavorite ditty of the late lamented Professor Mo-\nriarty. Colonel Sebastian Moran has also been\nknown to warble it. And yet I live and keep bees\nupon the South Downs.\u201d\n\u201cCurse you, you double traitor!\u201d cried the Ger-\nman, straining against his bonds and glaring mur-\nder from his furious eyes. \u201cNo, no, it is not so bad as that,\u201d said Holmes,\nsmiling. \u201cAs my speech surely shows you, Mr. Al-\ntamont of Chicago had no existence in fact. I used\nhim and he is gone.\u201d\n\u201cThen who are you?\u201d\n\u201cIt is really immaterial who I am, but since the\nmatter seems to interest you, Mr. Von Bork, I may\nsay that this is not my \ufb01rst acquaintance with the\nmembers of your family. I have done a good deal\nof business in Germany in the past and my name\nis probably familiar to you.\u201d\n\u201cI would wish to know it,\u201d said the Prussian\ngrimly. \u201cIt was I who brought about the separation be-\ntween Irene Adler and the late King of Bohemia\nwhen your cousin Heinrich was the Imperial En-\nvoy. It was I also who saved from murder, by the\nNihilist Klopman, Count Von und Zu Grafenstein,\nwho was your mother\u2019s elder brother. It was I\u2014\u201d\nVon Bork sat up in amazement. \u201cThere is only one man,\u201d he cried. \u201cExactly,\u201d said Holmes. Von Bork groaned and sank back on the sofa. \u201cAnd most of that information came through\nyou,\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat is it worth? What have I\ndone? It is my ruin forever!\u201d\n\u201cIt is certainly a little untrustworthy,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cIt will require some checking and you\nhave little time to check it. Your admiral may \ufb01nd\nthe new guns rather larger than he expects, and\nthe cruisers perhaps a tri\ufb02e faster.\u201d\nVon Bork clutched at his own throat in despair. \u201cThere are a good many other points of detail\nwhich will, no doubt, come to light in good time. But you have one quality which is very rare in a\nGerman, Mr. Von Bork: you are a sportsman and\nyou will bear me no ill-will when you realize that\nyou, who have outwitted so many other people,\nhave at last been outwitted yourself. After all, you\nhave done your best for your country, and I have\ndone my best for mine, and what could be more\nnatural? Besides,\u201d he added, not unkindly, as he\nlaid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate\nman, \u201cit is better than to fall before some ignoble\nfoe. These papers are now ready, Watson. If you\nwill help me with our prisoner, I think that we may\nget started for London at once.\u201d\nIt was no easy task to move Von Bork, for he\nwas a strong and a desperate man. Finally, hold-\ning either arm, the two friends walked him very\nslowly down the garden walk which he had trod\nwith such proud con\ufb01dence when he received the\ncongratulations of the famous diplomatist only a\nfew hours before."

One\nlikes to think that there is some fantastic limbo for the children of imagination, some strange,\nimpossible place where the beaux of Fielding may still make love to the belles of Richardson,\nwhere Scott\u2019s heroes still may strut, Dickens\u2019s delightful Cockneys still raise a laugh, and\nThackeray\u2019s worldlings continue to carry on their reprehensible careers. Perhaps in some\nhumble corner of such a Valhalla, Sherlock and his Watson may for a time \ufb01nd a place, while\nsome more astute sleuth with some even less astute comrade may \ufb01ll the stage which they\nhave vacated. His career has been a long one\u2014though it is possible to exaggerate it; decrepit gentlemen\nwho approach me and declare that his adventures formed the reading of their boyhood do\nnot meet the response from me which they seem to expect. One is not anxious to have one\u2019s\npersonal dates handled so unkindly. As a matter of cold fact, Holmes made his debut in A\nStudy in Scarlet and in The Sign of Four, two small booklets which appeared between 1887\nand 1889. It was in 1891 that \u201cA Scandal in Bohemia,\u201d the \ufb01rst of the long series of short\nstories, appeared in The Strand Magazine. The public seemed appreciative and desirous of\nmore, so that from that date, thirty-nine years ago, they have been produced in a broken se-\nries which now contains no fewer than \ufb01fty-six stories, republished in The Adventures, The\nMemoirs, The Return, and His Last Bow. And there remain these twelve published during the\nlast few years which are here produced under the title of The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. He began his adventures in the very heart of the later Victorian era, carried it through the\nall-too-short reign of Edward, and has managed to hold his own little niche even in these\nfeverish days. Thus it would be true to say that those who \ufb01rst read of him, as young men,\nhave lived to see their own grown-up children following the same adventures in the same\nmagazine. It is a striking example of the patience and loyalty of the British public. I had fully determined at the conclusion of The Memoirs to bring Holmes to an end, as\nI felt that my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel. That pale,\nclear-cut face and loose-limbed \ufb01gure were taking up an undue share of my imagination. I\ndid the deed, but fortunately no coroner had pronounced upon the remains, and so, after a\nlong interval, it was not dif\ufb01cult for me to respond to the \ufb02attering demand and to explain\nmy rash act away. I have never regretted it, for I have not in actual practice found that these\nlighter sketches have prevented me from exploring and \ufb01nding my limitations in such varied\nbranches of literature as history, poetry, historical novels, psychic research, and the drama. Had Holmes never existed I could not have done more, though he may perhaps have stood a\nlittle in the way of the recognition of my more serious literary work."

I thank you for your past constancy, and can\nbut hope that some return has been made in the shape of that distraction from the worries\nof life and stimulating change of thought which can only be found in the fairy kingdom of\nromance. The Illustrious Client\nThe Illustrious Client\nI\nt can\u2019t hurt now,\u201d was Mr. Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019s comment when, for the tenth\ntime in as many years, I asked his leave\nto reveal the following narrative. So it\nwas that at last I obtained permission to put on\nrecord what was, in some ways, the supreme mo-\nment of my friend\u2019s career. Both Holmes and I had a weakness for the\nTurkish bath. It was over a smoke in the pleas-\nant lassitude of the drying-room that I have found\nhim less reticent and more human than anywhere\nelse. On the upper \ufb02oor of the Northumberland\nAvenue establishment there is an isolated corner\nwhere two couches lie side by side, and it was\non these that we lay upon September 3, 1902, the\nday when my narrative begins. I had asked him\nwhether anything was stirring, and for answer he\nhad shot his long, thin, nervous arm out of the\nsheets which enveloped him and had drawn an\nenvelope from the inside pocket of the coat which\nhung beside him. \u201cIt may be some fussy, self-important fool; it\nmay be a matter of life or death,\u201d said he as he\nhanded me the note. \u201cI know no more than this\nmessage tells me.\u201d\nIt was from the Carlton Club and dated the\nevening before. This is what I read:\nSir James Damery presents his com-\npliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes and\nwill call upon him at 4.30 to-morrow. Sir James begs to say that the matter\nupon which he desires to consult Mr.\nHolmes is very delicate and also very\nimportant. He trusts, therefore, that\nMr. Holmes will make every effort to\ngrant this interview, and that he will\ncon\ufb01rm it over the telephone to the\nCarlton Club. \u201cI need not say that I have con\ufb01rmed it, Wat-\nson,\u201d said Holmes as I returned the paper. \u201cDo\nyou know anything of this man Damery?\u201d\n\u201cOnly that this name is a household word in\nsociety.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can tell you a little more than that. He\nhas rather a reputation for arranging delicate mat-\nters which are to be kept out of the papers. You\nmay remember his negotiations with Sir George\nLewis over the Hammerford Will case. He is a man\nof the world with a natural turn for diplomacy. I\nam bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a false\nscent and that he has some real need for our assis-\ntance.\u201d\n\u201cOur?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you will be so good, Watson.\u201d\n\u201cI shall be honoured.\u201d\n\u201cThen you have the hour\u20144.30. Until then we\ncan put the matter out of our heads.\u201d\nI was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne\nStreet at the time, but I was round at Baker Street\nbefore the time named."

It is\nhardly necessary to describe him, for many will\nremember that large, bluff, honest personality, that\nbroad, clean-shaven face, and, above all, that pleas-\nant, mellow voice. Frankness shone from his gray\nIrish eyes, and good humour played round his\nmobile, smiling lips. His lucent top-hat, his dark\nfrock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin\nin the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over\nthe varnished shoes, spoke of the meticulous care\nin dress for which he was famous. The big, mas-\nterful aristocrat dominated the little room. \u201cOf course, I was prepared to \ufb01nd Dr. Watson,\u201d\nhe remarked with a courteous bow. \u201cHis collabo-\nration may be very necessary, for we are dealing\non this occasion, Mr. Holmes, with a man to whom\nviolence is familiar and who will, literally, stick at\nnothing. I should say that there is no more dan-\ngerous man in Europe.\u201d\n\u201cI have had several opponents to whom that\n\ufb02attering term has been applied,\u201d said Holmes\nwith a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you smoke? Then you will\nexcuse me if I light my pipe. If your man is more\ndangerous than the late Professor Moriarty, or than\nthe living Colonel Sebastian Moran, then he is in-\ndeed worth meeting.

Wonderful! So you have already\nsized him up as a murderer?\u201d\n\u201cIt is my business to follow the details of Conti-\nnental crime. Who could possibly have read what\nhappened at Prague and have any doubts as to the\nman\u2019s guilt! It was a purely technical legal point\nand the suspicious death of a witness that saved\nhim! I am as sure that he killed his wife when the\nso-called \u2018accident\u2019 happened in the Splugen Pass\nas if I had seen him do it. I knew, also, that he\nhad come to England and had a presentiment that\nsooner or later he would \ufb01nd me some work to\ndo. Well, what has Baron Gruner been up to? I\npresume it is not this old tragedy which has come\nup again?\u201d\n855\nThe Illustrious Client\n\u201cNo, it is more serious than that. To revenge\ncrime is important, but to prevent it is more so. It is a terrible thing, Mr. Holmes, to see a dread-\nful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself\nbefore your eyes, to clearly understand whither it\nwill lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it. Can a human being be placed in a more trying po-\nsition?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d\n\u201cThen you will sympathize with the client in\nwhose interests I am acting.\u201d\n\u201cI did not understand that you were merely an\nintermediary. Who is the principal?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Holmes, I must beg you not to press that\nquestion.

May I, at least, lay all\nthat I can before you?\u201d\n\u201cBy all means, so long as it is understood that\nI commit myself to nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThat is understood. In the \ufb01rst place, you have\nno doubt heard of General de Merville?\u201d\n\u201cDe Merville of Khyber fame? Yes, I have heard\nof him.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a daughter, Violet de Merville, young,\nrich, beautiful, accomplished, a wonder-woman in\nevery way. It is this daughter, this lovely, innocent\ngirl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the\nclutches of a \ufb01end.\u201d\n\u201cBaron Gruner has some hold over her, then?\u201d\n\u201cThe strongest of all holds where a woman is\nconcerned\u2014the hold of love. The fellow is, as you\nmay have heard, extraordinarily handsome, with a\nmost fascinating manner, a gentle voice, and that\nair of romance and mystery which means so much\nto a woman. He is said to have the whole sex at his\nmercy and to have made ample use of the fact.\u201d\n\u201cBut how came such a man to meet a lady of\nthe standing of Miss Violet de Merville?\u201d\n\u201cIt was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage. The company, though select, paid their own pas-\nsages. No doubt the promoters hardly realized the\nBaron\u2019s true character until it was too late. The\nvillain attached himself to the lady, and with such\neffect that he has completely and absolutely won\nher heart. To say that she loves him hardly ex-\npresses it. She dotes upon him; she is obsessed by\nhim. Outside of him there is nothing on earth. She\nwill not hear one word against him. Everything\nhas been done to cure her of her madness, but in\nvain. To sum up, she proposes to marry him next\nmonth. As she is of age and has a will of iron, it is\nhard to know how to prevent her.\u201d\n\u201cDoes she know about the Austrian episode?\u201d\n\u201cThe cunning devil has told her every un-\nsavoury public scandal of his past life, but always\nin such a way as to make himself out to be an in-\nnocent martyr."

It is no doubt\nGeneral de Merville.\u201d\nOur visitor \ufb01dgeted in his chair. \u201cI could deceive you by saying so, Mr. Holmes,\nbut it would not be true. De Merville is a broken\nman. The strong soldier has been utterly demoral-\nized by this incident. He has lost the nerve which\nnever failed him on the battle\ufb01eld and has become\na weak, doddering old man, utterly incapable of\ncontending with a brilliant, forceful rascal like this\nAustrian. My client, however, is an old friend, one\nwho has known the General intimately for many\nyears and taken a paternal interest in this young\ngirl since she wore short frocks. He cannot see\nthis tragedy consummated without some attempt\nto stop it. There is nothing in which Scotland Yard\ncan act. It was his own suggestion that you should\nbe called in, but it was, as I have said, on the\nexpress stipulation that he should not be person-\nally involved in the matter. I have no doubt, Mr.\nHolmes, with your great powers you could easily\ntrace my client back through me, but I must ask\nyou, as a point of honour, to refrain from doing so,\nand not to break in upon his incognito.\u201d\nHolmes gave a whimsical smile. \u201cI think I may safely promise that,\u201d said he. \u201cI\nmay add that your problem interests me, and that\n856\nThe Illustrious Client\nI shall be prepared to look into it. How shall I keep\nin touch with you?\u201d\n\u201cThe Carlton Club will \ufb01nd me. But in case\nof emergency, there is a private telephone call,\n\u2018XX.31.\u2019 \u201d\nHolmes noted it down and sat, still smiling,\nwith the open memorandum-book upon his knee. \u201cThe Baron\u2019s present address, please?\u201d\n\u201cVernon Lodge, near Kingston. It is a large\nhouse. He has been fortunate in some rather shady\nspeculations and is a rich man, which naturally\nmakes him a more dangerous antagonist.\u201d\n\u201cIs he at home at present?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cApart from what you have told me, can you\ngive me any further information about the man?\u201d\n\u201cHe has expensive tastes. He is a horse fancier. For a short time he played polo at Hurlingham,\nbut then this Prague affair got noised about and he\nhad to leave. He collects books and pictures. He\nis a man with a considerable artistic side to his na-\nture. He is, I believe, a recognized authority upon\nChinese pottery and has written a book upon the\nsubject.\u201d\n\u201cA complex mind,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAll great\ncriminals have that. My old friend Charlie Peace\nwas a violin virtuoso. Wainwright was no mean\nartist. I could quote many more. Well, Sir James,\nyou will inform your client that I am turning my\nmind upon Baron Gruner. I can say no more. I\nhave some sources of information of my own, and\nI dare say we may \ufb01nd some means of opening the\nmatter up.\u201d\nWhen our visitor had left us Holmes sat so long\nin deep thought that it seemed to me that he had\nforgotten my presence."

And yet there is something in the suggestion if all\nelse fails. But I think we must begin from a dif-\nferent angle. I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson\nmight be a help.\u201d\nI have not had occasion to mention Shinwell\nJohnson in these memoirs because I have seldom\ndrawn my cases from the latter phases of my\nfriend\u2019s career. During the \ufb01rst years of the cen-\ntury he became a valuable assistant. Johnson, I\ngrieve to say, made his name \ufb01rst as a very dan-\ngerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst. Finally he repented and allied himself to Holmes,\nacting as his agent in the huge criminal under-\nworld of London and obtaining information which\noften proved to be of vital importance. Had John-\nson been a \u201cnark\u201d of the police he would soon have\nbeen exposed, but as he dealt with cases which\nnever came directly into the courts, his activities\nwere never realized by his companions. With the\nglamour of his two convictions upon him, he had\nthe entree of every night-club, doss house, and\ngambling-den in the town, and his quick observa-\ntion and active brain made him an ideal agent for\ngaining information. It was to him that Sherlock\nHolmes now proposed to turn. It was not possible for me to follow the imme-\ndiate steps taken by my friend, for I had some\npressing professional business of my own, but I\nmet him by appointment that evening at Simp-\nson\u2019s, where, sitting at a small table in the front\nwindow and looking down at the rushing stream\nof life in the Strand, he told me something of what\nhad passed. \u201cJohnson is on the prowl,\u201d said he. \u201cHe may\npick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the\nunderworld, for it is down there, amid the black\nroots of crime, that we must hunt for this man\u2019s\nsecrets.\u201d\n\u201cBut if the lady will not accept what is already\nknown, why should any fresh discovery of yours\nturn her from her purpose?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows, Watson? Woman\u2019s heart and\nmind are insoluble puzzles to the male. Murder\nmight be condoned or explained, and yet some\nsmaller offence might rankle. Baron Gruner re-\nmarked to me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe remarked to you!\u201d\n\u201cOh, to be sure, I had not told you of my plans. Well, Watson, I love to come to close grips with\nmy man. I like to meet him eye to eye and read\nfor myself the stuff that he is made of. When I\nhad given Johnson his instructions I took a cab out\nto Kingston and found the Baron in a most affable\nmood.\u201d\n\u201cDid he recognize you?\u201d\n\u201cThere was no dif\ufb01culty about that, for I sim-\nply sent in my card."

I\nhave a respect for your brains, Baron, and the lit-\ntle which I have seen of your personality has not\nlessened it. Let me put it to you as man to man. No one wants to rake up your past and make you\nunduly uncomfortable.

I don\u2019t think anyone\ncould do it better, but it is rather pathetic, all the\nsame. Not a colour card there, Mr. Holmes, noth-\ning but the smallest of the small.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018So you think.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018So I know. Let me make the thing clear to\nyou, for my own hand is so strong that I can afford\nto show it. I have been fortunate enough to win the\nentire affection of this lady. This was given to me\nin spite of the fact that I told her very clearly of all\nthe unhappy incidents in my past life. I also told\nher that certain wicked and designing persons\u2014I\nhope you recognize yourself\u2014would come to her\nand tell her these things, and I warned her how\nto treat them."

I am one of a hun-\ndred that he has tempted and used and ruined\nand thrown into the refuse heap, as he will you\nalso. Your refuse heap is more likely to be a grave,\nand maybe that\u2019s the best. I tell you, you foolish\nwoman, if you marry this man he\u2019ll be the death of\nyou. It may be a broken heart or it may be a bro-\nken neck, but he\u2019ll have you one way or the other. It\u2019s not out of love for you I\u2019m speaking. I don\u2019t\ncare a tinker\u2019s curse whether you live or die. It\u2019s\n860\nThe Illustrious Client\nout of hate for him and to spite him and to get\nback on him for what he did to me.

You unutterable fool!\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Mr. Holmes, I beg that you will bring this\ninterview to an end,\u2019 said the icy voice. \u2018I have\nobeyed my father\u2019s wish in seeing you, but I am\nnot compelled to listen to the ravings of this per-\nson.\u2019\n\u201cWith an oath Miss Winter darted forward,\nand if I had not caught her wrist she would have\nclutched this maddening woman by the hair. I\ndragged her towards the door and was lucky to\nget her back into the cab without a public scene,\nfor she was beside herself with rage. In a cold\nway I felt pretty furious myself, Watson, for there\nwas something indescribably annoying in the calm\naloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the\nwoman whom we were trying to save. So now\nonce again you know exactly how we stand, and it\nis clear that I must plan some fresh opening move,\nfor this gambit won\u2019t work. I\u2019ll keep in touch with\nyou, Watson, for it is more than likely that you\nwill have your part to play, though it is just pos-\nsible that the next move may lie with them rather\nthan with us.\u201d\nAnd it did."

I think I could show you the very paving-\nstone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon\nthe placard, and a pang of horror passed through\nmy very soul. It was between the Grand Hotel and\nCharing Cross Station, where a one-legged news-\nvender displayed his evening papers. The date was\njust two days after the last conversation. There,\nblack upon yellow, was the terrible news-sheet:\nMurderous Attack Upon Sherlock\nHolmes\nI think I stood stunned for some moments. Then I\nhave a confused recollection of snatching at a pa-\nper, of the remonstrance of the man, whom I had\nnot paid, and, \ufb01nally, of standing in the doorway\nof a chemist\u2019s shop while I turned up the fateful\nparagraph. This was how it ran:\nWe learn with regret that Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\nthe well-known private detective, was the victim\nthis morning of a murderous assault which has\nleft him in a precarious position. There are no ex-\nact details to hand, but the event seems to have\noccurred about twelve o\u2019clock in Regent Street,\noutside the Cafe Royal. The attack was made by\ntwo men armed with sticks, and Mr. Holmes was\nbeaten about the head and body, receiving injuries\nwhich the doctors describe as most serious. He\nwas carried to Charing Cross Hospital and after-\nwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in\nBaker Street. The miscreants who attacked him ap-\npear to have been respectably dressed men, who\nescaped from the bystanders by passing through\nthe Cafe Royal and out into Glasshouse Street be-\nhind it. No doubt they belonged to that criminal\nfraternity which has so often had occasion to be-\nwail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man. I need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced\nover the paragraph before I had sprung into a han-\nsom and was on my way to Baker Street. I found\nSir Leslie Oakshott, the famous surgeon, in the hall\nand his brougham waiting at the curb. \u201cNo immediate danger,\u201d was his report. \u201cTwo\nlacerated scalp wounds and some considerable\nbruises. Several stitches have been necessary. Mor-\nphine has been injected and quiet is essential, but\nan interview of a few minutes would not be abso-\nlutely forbidden.\u201d\nWith this permission I stole into the darkened\nroom. The sufferer was wide awake, and I heard\nmy name in a hoarse whisper. The blind was three-\nquarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted\nthrough and struck the bandaged head of the in-\njured man. A crimson patch had soaked through\nthe white linen compress. I sat beside him and\nbent my head. \u201cAll right, Watson. Don\u2019t look so scared,\u201d he\nmuttered in a very weak voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as\nit seems.\u201d\n\u201cThank God for that!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know. I took most of them on my guard."

Anything more?\u201d\n\u201cPut my pipe on the table\u2014and the tobacco-\nslipper. Right! Come in each morning and we will\nplan our campaign.\u201d\nI arranged with Johnson that evening to take\nMiss Winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay\nlow until the danger was past. For six days the public were under the impres-\nsion that Holmes was at the door of death. The\nbulletins were very grave and there were sinister\nparagraphs in the papers. My continual visits as-\nsured me that it was not so bad as that. His wiry\nconstitution and his determined will were work-\ning wonders. He was recovering fast, and I had\nsuspicions at times that he was really \ufb01nding him-\nself faster than he pretended even to me. There\nwas a curious secretive streak in the man which led\nto many dramatic effects, but left even his closest\nfriend guessing as to what his exact plans might\nbe. He pushed to an extreme the axiom that the\nonly safe plotter was he who plotted alone. I was\nnearer him than anyone else, and yet I was always\nconscious of the gap between. On the seventh day the stitches were taken out,\nin spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in\nthe evening papers. The same evening papers had\nan announcement which I was bound, sick or well,\nto carry to my friend. It was simply that among the\npassengers on the Cunard boat Ruritania, starting\nfrom Liverpool on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert\nGruner, who had some important \ufb01nancial busi-\nness to settle in the States before his impending\nwedding to Miss Violet de Merville, only daughter\nof, etc., etc. Holmes listened to the news with a\ncold, concentrated look upon his pale face, which\ntold me that it hit him hard. \u201cFriday!\u201d he cried."

Now, Watson, I want you to do\nsomething for me.\u201d\n\u201cI am here to be used, Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, spend the next twenty-four hours\nin an intensive study of Chinese pottery.\u201d\nHe gave no explanations and I asked for none. By long experience I had learned the wisdom of\nobedience. But when I had left his room I walked\ndown Baker Street, revolving in my head how on\nearth I was to carry out so strange an order. Fi-\nnally I drove to the London Library in St. James\u2019s\nSquare, put the matter to my friend Lomax, the\nsublibrarian, and departed to my rooms with a\ngoodly volume under my arm. It is said that the barrister who crams up a case\nwith such care that he can examine an expert wit-\nness upon the Monday has forgotten all his forced\nknowledge before the Saturday. Certainly I should\nnot like now to pose as an authority upon ceram-\nics. And yet all that evening, and all that night\nwith a short interval for rest, and all next morn-\ning, I was sucking in knowledge and committing\nnames to memory. There I learned of the hall-\nmarks of the great artist-decorators, of the mys-\ntery of cyclical dates, the marks of the Hung-wu\nand the beauties of the Yung-lo, the writings of\nTang-ying, and the glories of the primitive period\nof the Sung and the Yuan. I was charged with\nall this information when I called upon Holmes\nnext evening. He was out of bed now, though you\nwould not have guessed it from the published re-\nports, and he sat with his much-bandaged head\nresting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite\narmchair. \u201cWhy, Holmes,\u201d I said, \u201cif one believed the pa-\npers, you are dying.\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d said he, \u201cis the very impression which\nI intended to convey. And now, Watson, have you\nlearned your lessons?\u201d\n\u201cAt least I have tried to.\u201d\n\u201cGood. You could keep up an intelligent con-\nversation on the subject?\u201d\n\u201cI believe I could.\u201d\n\u201cThen hand me that little box from the mantel-\npiece.\u201d\nHe opened the lid and took out a small object\nmost carefully wrapped in some \ufb01ne Eastern silk. This he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate little\nsaucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour. \u201cIt needs careful handling, Watson. This is\nthe real egg-shell pottery of the Ming dynasty. No \ufb01ner piece ever passed through Christie\u2019s. A\ncomplete set of this would be worth a king\u2019s ran-\nsom\u2014in fact, it is doubtful if there is a complete set\n862\nThe Illustrious Client\noutside the imperial palace of Peking. The sight of\nthis would drive a real connoisseur wild.\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I to do with it?\u201d\nHolmes handed me a card upon which was\nprinted: \u201cDr. Hill Barton, 369 Half Moon Street.\u201d\n\u201cThat is your name for the evening, Watson."

You may as\nwell be a medical man, since that is a part which\nyou can play without duplicity. You are a collec-\ntor, this set has come your way, you have heard of\nthe Baron\u2019s interest in the subject, and you are not\naverse to selling at a price.\u201d\n\u201cWhat price?\u201d\n\u201cWell asked, Watson. You would certainly fall\ndown badly if you did not know the value of your\nown wares. This saucer was got for me by Sir\nJames, and comes, I understand, from the collec-\ntion of his client. You will not exaggerate if you\nsay that it could hardly be matched in the world.\u201d\n\u201cI could perhaps suggest that the set should be\nvalued by an expert.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent, Watson!

No answer needed. You will merely say that\nyou are coming, and why.\u201d\nIt was an admirable document, short, courte-\nous, and stimulating to the curiosity of the con-\nnoisseur.

The beautiful house and grounds indicated that\nBaron Gruner was, as Sir James had said, a man of\nconsiderable wealth. A long winding drive, with\nbanks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out\ninto a great gravelled square adorned with stat-\nues. The place had been built by a South African\ngold king in the days of the great boom, and the\nlong, low house with the turrets at the corners,\nthough an architectural nightmare, was imposing\nin its size and solidity. A butler, who would have\nadorned a bench of bishops, showed me in and\nhanded me over to a plush-clad footman, who ush-\nered me into the Baron\u2019s presence. He was standing at the open front of a great\ncase which stood between the windows and which\ncontained part of his Chinese collection. He turned\nas I entered with a small brown vase in his hand. \u201cPray sit down, Doctor,\u201d said he. \u201cI was\nlooking over my own treasures and wondering\nwhether I could really afford to add to them.

He seated himself at his desk, pulled over the\nlamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to\nexamine it. As he did so the yellow light beat upon\nhis own features, and I was able to study them at\nmy ease. He was certainly a remarkably handsome man. His European reputation for beauty was fully de-\nserved. In \ufb01gure he was not more than of mid-\ndle size, but was built upon graceful and active\nlines. His face was swarthy, almost Oriental, with\nlarge, dark, languorous eyes which might easily\nhold an irresistible fascination for women. His\nhair and moustache were raven black, the latter\nshort, pointed, and carefully waxed. His features\nwere regular and pleasing, save only his straight,\nthin-lipped mouth. If ever I saw a murderer\u2019s\nmouth it was there\u2014a cruel, hard gash in the face,\ncompressed, inexorable, and terrible. He was ill-\nadvised to train his moustache away from it, for it\nwas Nature\u2019s danger-signal, set as a warning to his\nvictims. His voice was engaging and his manners\nperfect. In age I should have put him at little over\nthirty, though his record afterwards showed that\nhe was forty-two. \u201cVery \ufb01ne\u2014very \ufb01ne indeed!\u201d he said at last. \u201cAnd you say you have a set of six to correspond. What puzzles me is that I should not have heard of\nsuch magni\ufb01cent specimens. I only know of one in\nEngland to match this, and it is certainly not likely\nto be in the market. Would it be indiscreet if I\nwere to ask you, Dr. Hill Barton, how you obtained\nthis?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d I asked with as care-\nless an air as I could muster. \u201cYou can see that the\npiece is genuine, and, as to the value, I am content\nto take an expert\u2019s valuation.\u201d\n863\nThe Illustrious Client\n\u201cVery mysterious,\u201d said he with a quick, suspi-\ncious \ufb02ash of his dark eyes. \u201cIn dealing with ob-\njects of such value, one naturally wishes to know\nall about the transaction.

And yet the whole transaction\nstrikes me as rather unusual.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do business or not,\u201d said I with indif-\nference. \u201cI have given you the \ufb01rst offer as I un-\nderstood that you were a connoisseur, but I shall\nhave no dif\ufb01culty in other quarters.\u201d\n\u201cWho told you I was a connoisseur?\u201d\n\u201cI was aware that you had written a book upon\nthe subject.\u201d\n\u201cHave you read the book?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDear me, this becomes more and more dif\ufb01-\ncult for me to understand!"

Two steps took me to the open door, and my\nmind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene\nwithin. The window leading out to the garden was\nwide open. Beside it, looking like some terrible\nghost, his head girt with bloody bandages, his face\ndrawn and white, stood Sherlock Holmes. The\nnext instant he was through the gap, and I heard\nthe crash of his body among the laurel bushes out-\nside. With a howl of rage the master of the house\nrushed after him to the open window.

The vitriol was eating into it everywhere\nand dripping from the ears and the chin. One eye\nwas already white and glazed. The other was red\nand in\ufb02amed. The features which I had admired\n864\nThe Illustrious Client\na few minutes before were now like some beauti-\nful painting over which the artist has passed a wet\nand foul sponge. They were blurred, discoloured,\ninhuman, terrible. In a few words I explained exactly what had oc-\ncurred, so far as the vitriol attack was concerned. Some had climbed through the window and oth-\ners had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark\nand it had begun to rain.

Oh,\nGod in heaven, this pain is more than I can bear!\u201d\nI bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on\nthe raw surfaces, and administered a hypodermic\nof morphia.

It would have\nbeen useless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for\nI was nearly as well known by sight at the Yard as\nHolmes himself. Then I left that house of gloom\nand terror.

She would love him the more as a dis\ufb01gured\nmartyr. No, no. It is his moral side, not his physi-\ncal, which we have to destroy. That book will bring\nher back to earth\u2014and I know nothing else that\ncould. It is in his own writing. She cannot get past\nit.\u201d\nSir James carried away both it and the precious\nsaucer.

Sherlock Holmes\nwas threatened with a prosecution for burglary,\nbut when an object is good and a client is suf\ufb01-\nciently illustrious, even the rigid British law be-\ncomes human and elastic. My friend has not yet\nstood in the dock. The Blanched Soldier\nThe Blanched Soldier\nT\nhe ideas of my friend Watson, though\nlimited, are exceedingly pertinacious. For a long time he has worried me to\nwrite an experience of my own. Perhaps\nI have rather invited this persecution, since I have\noften had occasion to point out to him how su-\nper\ufb01cial are his own accounts and to accuse him\nof pandering to popular taste instead of con\ufb01ning\nhimself rigidly to facts and \ufb01gures. \u201cTry it your-\nself, Holmes!\u201d he has retorted, and I am compelled\nto admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I\ndo begin to realize that the matter must be pre-\nsented in such a way as may interest the reader. The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it\nis among the strangest happenings in my collec-\ntion, though it chanced that Watson had no note\nof it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend\nand biographer, I would take this opportunity to\nremark that if I burden myself with a compan-\nion in my various little inquiries it is not done\nout of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson\nhas some remarkable characteristics of his own to\nwhich in his modesty he has given small attention\namid his exaggerated estimates of my own perfor-\nmances.

Dodd, a big,\nfresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good\nWatson had at that time deserted me for a wife,\nthe only sel\ufb01sh action which I can recall in our as-\nsociation. I was alone. It is my habit to sit with my back to the win-\ndow and to place my visitors in the opposite chair,\nwhere the light falls full upon them. Mr. James M.\nDodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the\ninterview. I did not attempt to help him, for his si-\nlence gave me more time for observation. I have\nfound it wise to impress clients with a sense of\npower, and so I gave him some of my conclusions. \u201cFrom South Africa, sir, I perceive.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he answered, with some surprise. \u201cImperial Yeomanry, I fancy.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cMiddlesex Corps, no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.\u201d\nI smiled at his bewildered expression. \u201cWhen a gentleman of virile appearance enters\nmy room with such tan upon his face as an English\nsun could never give, and with his handkerchief in\nhis sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not dif\ufb01cult\nto place him. You wear a short beard, which shows\nthat you were not a regular. You have the cut of a\nriding-man. As to Middlesex, your card has al-\nready shown me that you are a stockbroker from\nThrogmorton Street. What other regiment would\nyou join?\u201d\n\u201cYou see everything.\u201d\n\u201cI see no more than you, but I have trained my-\nself to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it\nwas not to discuss the science of observation that\nyou called upon me this morning. What has been\nhappening at Tuxbury Old Park?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Holmes\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cMy dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter\ncame with that heading, and as you \ufb01xed this ap-\npointment in very pressing terms it was clear that\nsomething sudden and important had occurred.\u201d\n\u201cYes, indeed. But the letter was written in the\nafternoon, and a good deal has happened since\nthen. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me\nout\u2014\u201d\n\u201cKicked you out!\u201d\n\u201cWell, that was what it amounted to. He is\na hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest\nmartinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day\nof rough language, too. I couldn\u2019t have stuck the\ncolonel if it had not been for Godfrey\u2019s sake.\u201d\nI lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair. \u201cPerhaps you will explain what you are talking\nabout.\u201d\nMy client grinned mischievously. \u201cI had got into the way of supposing that you\nknew everything without being told,\u201d said he. \u201cBut I will give you the facts, and I hope to God\nthat you will be able to tell me what they mean.

He was Colonel Emsworth\u2019s\nonly son\u2014Emsworth, the Crimean V. C.\u2014and he\nhad the \ufb01ghting blood in him, so it is no wonder he\nvolunteered. There was not a \ufb01ner lad in the regi-\nment. We formed a friendship\u2014the sort of friend-\nship which can only be made when one lives the\nsame life and shares the same joys and sorrows. He was my mate\u2014and that means a good deal in\nthe Army. We took the rough and the smooth to-\ngether for a year of hard \ufb01ghting. Then he was hit\nwith a bullet from an elephant gun in the action\n869\nThe Blanched Soldier\nnear Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. I got one let-\nter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from\nSouthampton. Since then not a word\u2014not one\nword, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and\nhe my closest pal. \u201cWell, when the war was over, and we all got\nback, I wrote to his father and asked where God-\nfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I\nwrote again. This time I had a reply, short and\ngruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the\nworld, and it was not likely that he would be back\nfor a year. That was all. \u201cI wasn\u2019t satis\ufb01ed, Mr. Holmes. The whole\nthing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was\na good lad, and he would not drop a pal like that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to\nknow that he was heir to a lot of money, and also\nthat his father and he did not always hit it off too\nwell. The old man was sometimes a bully, and\nyoung Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No,\nI wasn\u2019t satis\ufb01ed, and I determined that I would\nget to the root of the matter. It happened, however,\nthat my own affairs needed a lot of straightening\nout, after two years\u2019 absence, and so it is only this\nweek that I have been able to take up Godfrey\u2019s\ncase again. But since I have taken it up I mean to\ndrop everything in order to see it through.\u201d\nMr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of\nperson whom it would be better to have as a friend\nthan as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his\nsquare jaw had set hard as he spoke. \u201cWell, what have you done?\u201d I asked. \u201cMy \ufb01rst move was to get down to his home,\nTuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for\nmyself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother,\ntherefore\u2014I had had quite enough of the curmud-\ngeon of a father\u2014and I made a clean frontal attack:\nGodfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of inter-\nest which I might tell her of our common expe-\nriences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would\nthere be any objection, et cetera?"

That was what took me\ndown on Monday. \u201cTuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible\u2014\ufb01ve miles\nfrom anywhere. There was no trap at the station,\nso I had to walk, carrying my suitcase, and it was\nnearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wan-\ndering house, standing in a considerable park. I\nshould judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles,\nstarting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation\nand ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was\nall panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pic-\ntures, a house of shadows and mystery. There was\na butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same\nage as the house, and there was his wife, who\nmight have been older. She had been Godfrey\u2019s\nnurse, and I had heard him speak of her as sec-\nond only to his mother in his affections, so I was\ndrawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The\nmother I liked also\u2014a gentle little white mouse of\na woman. It was only the colonel himself whom I\nbarred. \u201cWe had a bit of barney right away, and I\nshould have walked back to the station if I had\nnot felt that it might be playing his game for me\nto do so. I was shown straight into his study, and\nthere I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with\na smoky skin and a straggling gray beard, seated\nbehind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted\nout like a vulture\u2019s beak, and two \ufb01erce gray eyes\nglared at me from under tufted brows. I could un-\nderstand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his\nfather. \u201c \u2018Well, sir,\u2019 said he in a rasping voice, \u2018I should\nbe interested to know the real reasons for this\nvisit.\u2019\n\u201cI answered that I had explained them in my\nletter to his wife. \u201c \u2018Yes, yes, you said that you had known God-\nfrey in Africa.

Many\nties and memories united us. Is it not natural that\nI should wonder at his sudden silence and should\nwish to know what has become of him?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I have some recollections, sir, that I had al-\nready corresponded with you and had told you\nwhat had become of him. He has gone upon a\nvoyage round the world. His health was in a poor\nway after his African experiences, and both his\nmother and I were of opinion that complete rest\nand change were needed. Kindly pass that expla-\nnation on to any other friends who may be inter-\nested in the matter.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Certainly,\u2019 I answered."

His great eyebrows came down over\nhis eyes, and he tapped his \ufb01ngers impatiently on\n870\nThe Blanched Soldier\nthe table.

I could only pretend to ac-\ncept the situation and register a vow inwardly that\nI would never rest until my friend\u2019s fate had been\ncleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined qui-\netly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but\nthe old man seemed morose and depressed. I was\nso bored by the whole proceeding that I made an\nexcuse as soon as I decently could and retired to\nmy bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the\nground \ufb02oor, as gloomy as the rest of the house,\nbut after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr.\nHolmes, one is not too particular about one\u2019s quar-\nters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the\ngarden, remarking that it was a \ufb01ne night with a\nbright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roar-\ning \ufb01re with the lamp on a table beside me, and\nendeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I\nwas interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler,\nwho came in with a fresh supply of coals. \u201c \u2018I thought you might run short in the night-\ntime, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are\ncold.\u2019\n\u201cHe hesitated before leaving the room, and\nwhen I looked round he was standing facing me\nwith a wistful look upon his wrinkled face. \u201c \u2018Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help\nhearing what you said of young Master Godfrey\nat dinner."

The old\nman\u2019s words seemed to me to bear only one in-\nterpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become\ninvolved in some criminal or, at the least, disrep-\nutable transaction which touched the family hon-\nour.

No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and\nbeen misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business,\nif it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty\nto hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was\nanxiously pondering the matter when I looked up,\nand there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before\nme.\u201d\nMy client had paused as one in deep emotion. \u201cPray continue,\u201d I said. \u201cYour problem\npresents some very unusual features.\u201d\n\u201cHe was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with\nhis face pressed against the glass.

It wasn\u2019t merely that ghastly face\nglimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. It was more subtle than that\u2014something slinking,\nsomething furtive, something guilty\u2014 something\nvery unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known.

Godfrey had hardly\nvanished before I was at the window. There was\nan awkward catch, and I was some little time be-\nfore I could throw it up. Then I nipped through\nand ran down the garden path in the direction that\nI thought he might have taken. \u201cIt was a long path and the light was not very\ngood, but it seemed to me something was moving\nahead of me.

He had picked up a time-\ntable in the hall. \u201c \u2018There is a train to London at 8.30,\u2019 said he. \u2018The trap will be at the door at eight.\u2019\n\u201cHe was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt\nmyself in so dif\ufb01cult a position that I could only\nstammer out a few incoherent apologies in which\nI tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for\nmy friend. \u201c \u2018The matter will not bear discussion,\u2019 said he\nabruptly. \u2018You have made a most damnable intru-\nsion into the privacy of our family. You were here\nas a guest and you have become a spy. I have noth-\ning more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever\nto see you again.\u2019\n\u201cAt this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I\nspoke with some warmth. \u201c \u2018I have seen your son, and I am convinced that\nfor some reason of your own you are concealing\nhim from the world. I have no idea what your mo-\ntives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I\nam sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn\nyou, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as\nto the safety and well-being of my friend I shall\nnever desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of\nthe mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself\nto be intimidated by anything which you may say\nor do.\u2019\n\u201cThe old fellow looked diabolical, and I really\nthought he was about to attack me. I have said\nthat he was a gaunt, \ufb01erce old giant, and though\nI am no weakling I might have been hard put to\nit to hold my own against him. However, after\na long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and\nwalked out of the room. For my part, I took the\nappointed train in the morning, with the full in-\ntention of coming straight to you and asking for\nyour advice and assistance at the appointment for\nwhich I had already written.\u201d\nSuch was the problem which my visitor laid be-\nfore me. It presented, as the astute reader will have\nalready perceived, few dif\ufb01culties in its solution,\nfor a very limited choice of alternatives must get to\nthe root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was,\nthere were points of interest and novelty about it\nwhich may excuse my placing it upon record. I\nnow proceeded, using my familiar method of log-\nical analysis, to narrow down the possible solu-\ntions. \u201cThe servants,\u201d I asked; \u201chow many were in\nthe house?\u201d\n\u201cTo the best of my belief there were only the\nold butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the\nsimplest fashion.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no servant, then, in the detached\nhouse?\u201d\n\u201cNone, unless the little man with the beard\nacted as such."

I simply asked\nif they knew anything of my old comrade, God-\nfrey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he\nhad gone for a voyage round the world. He had\ncome home and then had almost at once started\noff again. The story was evidently universally ac-\ncepted.\u201d\n\u201cYou said nothing of your suspicions?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cThat was very wise.

I\nhad also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey\nwhich called for immediate action, as political con-\nsequences of the gravest kind might arise from its\nneglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning\n873\nThe Blanched Soldier\nof the next week, as my diary records, that I was\nable to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire\nin company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove\nto Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gen-\ntleman of iron-gray aspect, with whom I had made\nthe necessary arrangements. \u201cThis is an old friend,\u201d said I to Dodd. \u201cIt is\npossible that his presence may be entirely unnec-\nessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further\ninto the matter.\u201d\nThe narratives of Watson have accustomed the\nreader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste\nwords or disclose my thoughts while a case is\nactually under consideration. Dodd seemed sur-\nprised, but nothing more was said, and the three\nof us continued our journey together. In the train\nI asked Dodd one more question which I wished\nour companion to hear. \u201cYou say that you saw your friend\u2019s face quite\nclearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure\nof his identity?\u201d\n\u201cI have no doubt about it whatever. His nose\nwas pressed against the glass. The lamplight\nshone full upon him.\u201d\n\u201cIt could not have been someone resembling\nhim?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it was he.\u201d\n\u201cBut you say he was changed?\u201d\n\u201cOnly in colour. His face was\u2014how shall I de-\nscribe it?\u2014it was of a \ufb01sh-belly whiteness. It was\nbleached.\u201d\n\u201cWas it equally pale all over?\u201d\n\u201cI think not. It was his brow which I saw so\nclearly as it was pressed against the window.\u201d\n\u201cDid you call to him?\u201d\n\u201cI was too startled and horri\ufb01ed for the mo-\nment."

When, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the\nstrange old rambling house which my client had\ndescribed, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who\nopened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage\nfor the day and had asked my elderly friend to\nremain within it unless we should summon him. Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the con-\nventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-\nsalt trousers, with only one curious variant. He\nwore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us\nhe instantly shuf\ufb02ed off, laying them down on the\nhall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend\nWatson may have remarked, an abnormally acute\nset of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was\napparent. It seemed to centre on the hall-table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off,\nstooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my\nnose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was un-\ndoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour\nwas oozing. I passed on into the study with my\ncase complete. Alas, that I should have to show\nmy hand so when I tell my own story! It was by\nconcealing such links in the chain that Watson was\nenabled to produce his meretricious \ufb01nales. Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he\ncame quickly enough on receipt of Ralph\u2019s mes-\nsage. We heard his quick, heavy step in the pas-\nsage. The door was \ufb02ung open and he rushed in\nwith bristling beard and twisted features, as ter-\nrible an old man as ever I have seen. He held\nour cards in his hand, and he tore them up and\nstamped on the fragments. \u201cHave I not told you, you infernal busybody,\nthat you are warned off the premises? Never dare\nto show your damned face here again. If you enter\nagain without my leave I shall be within my rights\nif I use violence. I\u2019ll shoot you, sir! By God, I will! As to you, sir,\u201d turning upon me, \u201cI extend the\nsame warning to you. I am familiar with your ig-\nnoble profession, but you must take your reputed\ntalents to some other \ufb01eld.

Tell him there are burglars in the\nhouse.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d said I. \u201cYou must be aware, Mr.\nDodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights\nand that we have no legal status within his house.

You heard I was hit?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I heard that, but I never got particulars.\u201d\n\u201cThree of us got separated from the others. It was very broken country, you may remember. There was Simpson\u2014the fellow we called Baldy\nSimpson\u2014 and Anderson, and I. We were clearing\nbrother Boer, but he lay low and got the three of us. The other two were killed. I got an elephant bullet\nthrough my shoulder. I stuck on to my horse, how-\never, and he galloped several miles before I fainted\nand rolled off the saddle. \u201cWhen I came to myself it was nightfall, and\nI raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. To\nmy surprise there was a house close beside me,\na fairly large house with a broad stoep and many\nwindows. It was deadly cold. You remember the\nkind of numb cold which used to come at evening,\na deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from\na crisp healthy frost. Well, I was chilled to the\nbone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching\nthat house. I staggered to my feet and dragged\nmyself along, hardly conscious of what I did. I\nhave a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps,\nentering a wide-opened door, passing into a large\nroom which contained several beds, and throwing\nmyself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one\nof them. It was unmade, but that troubled me not\nat all. I drew the clothes over my shivering body\nand in a moment I was in a deep sleep. \u201cIt was morning when I wakened, and it\nseemed to me that instead of coming out into a\nworld of sanity I had emerged into some extraordi-\nnary nightmare. The African sun \ufb02ooded through\nthe big, curtainless windows, and every detail of\nthe great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out\nhard and clear. In front of me was standing a\nsmall, dwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head,\nwho was jabbering excitedly in Dutch, waving two\nhorrible hands which looked to me like brown\nsponges. Behind him stood a group of people who\nseemed to be intensely amused by the situation,\nbut a chill came over me as I looked at them. Not\none of them was a normal human being. Every\none was twisted or swollen or dis\ufb01gured in some\nstrange way. The laughter of these strange mon-\nstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear. 875\nThe Blanched Soldier\n\u201cIt seemed that none of them could speak En-\nglish, but the situation wanted clearing up, for\nthe creature with the big head was growing furi-\nously angry, and, uttering wild-beast cries, he had\nlaid his deformed hands upon me and was drag-\nging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh \ufb02ow of\nblood from my wound. The little monster was as\nstrong as a bull, and I don\u2019t know what he might\nhave done to me had not an elderly man who was\nclearly in authority been attracted to the room by\nthe hubbub."

We had two ser-\nvants whom we could utterly trust. There was a\nhouse where I could live. Under pledge of secrecy,\nMr. Kent, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay\nwith me. It seemed simple enough on those lines. The alternative was a dreadful one\u2014segregation\nfor life among strangers with never a hope of re-\nlease.

I was able once to do\nhim a professional service, and he is ready to ad-\nvise as a friend rather than as a specialist. His\nname is Sir James Saunders.\u201d\nThe prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts\nwould not have excited greater wonder and plea-\nsure in a raw subaltern than was now re\ufb02ected\nupon the face of Mr. Kent. \u201cI shall indeed be proud,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThen I will ask Sir James to step this way. He is at present in the carriage outside the door. Meanwhile, Colonel Emsworth, we may perhaps\nassemble in your study, where I could give the nec-\nessary explanations.\u201d\nAnd here it is that I miss my Watson. By\ncunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he\ncould elevate my simple art, which is but system-\natized common sense, into a prodigy. When I tell\nmy own story I have no such aid. And yet I will\ngive my process of thought even as I gave it to my\nsmall audience, which included Godfrey\u2019s mother\nin the study of Colonel Emsworth. \u201cThat process,\u201d said I, \u201cstarts upon the suppo-\nsition that when you have eliminated all which is\nimpossible, then whatever remains, however im-\nprobable, must be the truth. It may well be that\nseveral explanations remain, in which case one\ntries test after test until one or other of them has\na convincing amount of support. We will now\napply this principle to the case in point. As it\nwas \ufb01rst presented to me, there were three pos-\nsible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration\nof this gentleman in an outhouse of his father\u2019s\nmansion. There was the explanation that he was\nin hiding for a crime, or that he was mad and\nthat they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he\nhad some disease which caused his segregation. I\ncould think of no other adequate solutions. These,\n876\nthen, had to be sifted and balanced against each\nother. \u201cThe criminal solution would not bear inspec-\ntion. No unsolved crime had been reported from\nthat district. I was sure of that. If it were some\ncrime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be\nto the interest of the family to get rid of the delin-\nquent and send him abroad rather than keep him\nconcealed at home. I could see no explanation for\nsuch a line of conduct. \u201cInsanity was more plausible. The presence\nof the second person in the outhouse suggested\na keeper. The fact that he locked the door when he\ncame out strengthened the supposition and gave\nthe idea of constraint. On the other hand, this con-\nstraint could not be severe or the young man could\nnot have got loose and come down to have a look\nat his friend. You will remember, Mr. Dodd, that\nI felt round for points, asking you, for example,\nabout the paper which Mr. Kent was reading."

Fairly took me in, he did, and\nI ought to know his ways by now.\u201d Billy pointed\nwith a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned\nagainst the sofa. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the old woman\u2019s\nout\ufb01t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what is it all about, Billy?\u201d\nBilly sank his voice, as one who discusses great\nsecrets of State. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, sir, but\nit should go no farther. It\u2019s this case of the Crown\ndiamond.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014the\nhundred-thousand-pound\nbur-\nglary?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we\nhad the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary\nboth sitting on that very sofa. Mr. Holmes was\nvery nice to them. He soon put them at their ease\nand promised he would do all he could. Then\nthere is Lord Cantlemere\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, you know what that means. He\u2019s a\nstiff \u2019un, sir, if I may say so. I can get along with\nthe Prime Minister, and I\u2019ve nothing against the\nHome Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort\nof man, but I can\u2019t stand his Lordship. Neither can\nMr. Holmes, sir. You see, he don\u2019t believe in Mr.\nHolmes and he was against employing him. He\u2019d\nrather he failed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Mr. Holmes knows it?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Holmes always knows whatever there is\nto know.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll hope he won\u2019t fail and that Lord\nCantlemere will be confounded. But I say, Billy,\nwhat is that curtain for across the window?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Holmes had it put up there three days\nago. We\u2019ve got something funny behind it.\u201d\nBilly advanced and drew away the drapery\nwhich screened the alcove of the bow window. Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amaze-\nment. There was a facsimile of his old friend,\ndressing-gown and all, the face turned three-\nquarters towards the window and downward, as\nthough reading an invisible book, while the body\nwas sunk deep in an armchair."

But when it\u2019s up you can see\nthis from across the way.\u201d\n\u201cWe used something of the sort once before.\u201d\n\u201cBefore my time,\u201d said Billy. He drew the win-\ndow curtains apart and looked out into the street. \u201cThere are folk who watch us from over yonder. I\ncan see a fellow now at the window. Have a look\nfor yourself.\u201d\nWatson had taken a step forward when the\nbedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of\nHolmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his\nstep and bearing as active as ever. With a single\nspring he was at the window, and had drawn the\nblind once more. \u201cThat will do, Billy,\u201d said he. \u201cYou were in dan-\nger of your life then, my boy, and I can\u2019t do with-\nout you just yet. Well, Watson, it is good to see\nyou in your old quarters once again. You come at\na critical moment.\u201d\n\u201cSo I gather.\u201d\n\u201cYou can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Wat-\nson. How far am I justi\ufb01ed in allowing him to be\nin danger?\u201d\n\u201cDanger of what, Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cOf sudden death. I\u2019m expecting something\nthis evening.\u201d\n881\nThe Adventure Of The Mazarin Stone\n\u201cExpecting what?\u201d\n\u201cTo be murdered, Watson.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, you are joking, Holmes!\u201d\n\u201cEven my limited sense of humour could\nevolve a better joke than that. But we may be com-\nfortable in the meantime, may we not? Is alcohol\npermitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old\nplace. Let me see you once more in the customary\narmchair. You have not, I hope, learned to despise\nmy pipe and my lamentable tobacco? It has to take\nthe place of food these days.\u201d\n\u201cBut why not eat?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the faculties become re\ufb01ned when\nyou starve them. Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear\nWatson, you must admit that what your digestion\ngains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to\nthe brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is\na mere appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must\nconsider.\u201d\n\u201cBut this danger, Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, in case it should come off, it would\nperhaps be as well that you should burden your\nmemory with the name and address of the mur-\nderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with\nmy love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the\nname\u2014Count Negretto Sylvius. Write it down,\nman, write it down! 136 Moorside Gardens, N.\nW. Got it?\u201d\nWatson\u2019s honest face was twitching with anx-\niety. He knew only too well the immense risks\ntaken by Holmes and was well aware that what he\nsaid was more likely to be under-statement than\nexaggeration. Watson was always the man of ac-\ntion, and he rose to the occasion. \u201cCount me in, Holmes."

Life is full of whim-\nsical happenings, Watson.\u201d\n\u201cIt might have been tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cWell, perhaps it might. I followed him\nto old Straubenzee\u2019s workshop in the Minories. Straubenzee made the air-gun\u2014a very pretty bit\nof work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in\nthe opposite window at the present moment. Have\nyou seen the dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to\nyou. Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful\nhead at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it?\u201d\nThe boy had reappeared in the room with a\ncard upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it with raised\neyebrows and an amused smile. \u201cThe man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possi-\nbly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter\nof big game. It would indeed be a triumphant end-\ning to his excellent sporting record if he added me\nto his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very\nclose behind his heel.\u201d\n\u201cSend for the police.\u201d\n\u201cI probably shall. But not just yet. Would you\nglance carefully out of the window, Watson, and\nsee if anyone is hanging about in the street?\u201d\nWatson looked warily round the edge of the\ncurtain. \u201cYes, there is one rough fellow near the door.\u201d\n\u201cThat will be Sam Merton\u2014the faithful but\nrather fatuous Sam. Where is this gentleman,\nBilly?\u201d\n\u201cIn the waiting-room, sir.\u201d\n\u201cShow him up when I ring.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cIf I am not in the room, show him in all the\nsame.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n882\nThe Adventure Of The Mazarin Stone\nWatson waited until the door was closed, and\nthen he turned earnestly to his companion."

I rather\nwant to see my shark without his seeing me, and I\nhave, as you will remember, my own way of doing\nit.\u201d\nIt was, therefore, an empty room into which\nBilly,\na minute later,\nushered Count Sylvius. The famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-\nabout-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a\nformidable dark moustache shading a cruel, thin-\nlipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved\nnose like the beak of an eagle. He was well\ndressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and\nglittering rings were \ufb02amboyant in their effect. As\nthe door closed behind him he looked round him\nwith \ufb01erce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a\ntrap at every turn. Then he gave a violent start\nas he saw the impassive head and the collar of\nthe dressing-gown which projected above the arm-\nchair in the window. At \ufb01rst his expression was\none of pure amazement. Then the light of a horri-\nble hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. He\ntook one more glance round to see that there were\nno witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick\nhalf raised, he approached the silent \ufb01gure. He\nwas crouching for his \ufb01nal spring and blow when\na cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open\nbedroom door:\n\u201cDon\u2019t break it, Count! Don\u2019t break it!\u201d\nThe assassin staggered back, amazement in his\nconvulsed face. For an instant he half raised his\nloaded cane once more, as if he would turn his\nviolence from the ef\ufb01gy to the original; but there\nwas something in that steady gray eye and mock-\ning smile which caused his hand to sink to his side. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty little thing,\u201d said Holmes, ad-\nvancing towards the image. \u201cTavernier, the French\nmodeller, made it. He is as good at waxworks as\nyour friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.\u201d\n\u201cAir-guns, sir! What do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cPut your hat and stick on the side-table. Thank you! Pray take a seat. Would you care to\nput your revolver out also?"

That is why I am here. I won\u2019t deny that\nI intended to assault you just now.\u201d\nHolmes swung his leg on the edge of the table. \u201cI rather gathered that you had some idea of\nthe sort in your head,\u201d said he. \u201cBut why these\npersonal attentions?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you have gone out of your way to an-\nnoy me.

There was another,\nmore practical, reason. I want that yellow dia-\nmond!\u201d\nCount Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil\nsmile. \u201cUpon my word!\u201d said he. \u201cYou knew that I was after you for that.

A few moments later the\nlong-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting\nof tunes came faintly through the closed door of\nthe bedroom. \u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d asked Merton anxiously as\nhis companion turned to him. \u201cDoes he know\nabout the stone?\u201d\n885\nThe Adventure Of The Mazarin Stone\n\u201cHe knows a damned sight too much about it. I\u2019m not sure that he doesn\u2019t know all about it.\u201d\n\u201cGood Lord!\u201d The boxer\u2019s sallow face turned a\nshade whiter. \u201cIkey Sanders has split on us.\u201d\n\u201cHe has, has he? I\u2019ll do him down a thick \u2019un\nfor that if I swing for it.\u201d\n\u201cThat won\u2019t help us much. We\u2019ve got to make\nup our minds what to do.\u201d\n\u201cHalf a mo\u2019,\u201d said the boxer, looking suspi-\nciously at the bedroom door. \u201cHe\u2019s a leary cove\nthat wants watching. I suppose he\u2019s not listening?\u201d\n\u201cHow can he be listening with that music go-\ning?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Maybe somebody\u2019s behind a cur-\ntain. Too many curtains in this room.\u201d As he\nlooked round he suddenly saw for the \ufb01rst time\nthe ef\ufb01gy in the window, and stood staring and\npointing, too amazed for words. \u201cTut! it\u2019s only a dummy,\u201d said the Count. \u201cA fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tus-\nsaud ain\u2019t in it. It\u2019s the living spit of him, gown\nand all. But them curtains, Count!\u201d\n\u201cOh, confound the curtains! We are wasting\nour time, and there is none too much. He can lag\nus over this stone.\u201d\n\u201cThe deuce he can!\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019ll let us slip if we only tell him where\nthe swag is.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! Give it up? Give up a hundred thou-\nsand quid?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one or the other.\u201d\nMerton scratched his short-cropped pate. \u201cHe\u2019s alone in there. Let\u2019s do him in. If his\nlight were out we should have nothing to fear.\u201d\nThe Count shook his head."

Hallo! What was that?\u201d\nThere was a vague sound which seemed to\ncome from the window. Both men sprang round,\nbut all was quiet. Save for the one strange \ufb01gure\nseated in the chair, the room was certainly empty. \u201cSomething in the street,\u201d said Merton. \u201cNow\nlook here, guv\u2019nor, you\u2019ve got the brains.

If slugging is no use\nthen it\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve fooled better men than he,\u201d the Count an-\nswered. \u201cThe stone is here in my secret pocket. I\ntake no chances leaving it about. It can be out of\nEngland to-night and cut into four pieces in Ams-\nterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van\nSeddar.\u201d\n\u201cI thought Van Seddar was going next week.\u201d\n\u201cHe was. But now he must get off by the next\nboat. One or other of us must slip round with the\nstone to Lime Street and tell him.\u201d\n\u201cBut the false bottom ain\u2019t ready.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he must take it as it is and chance it. There\u2019s not a moment to lose.\u201d Again, with the\nsense of danger which becomes an instinct with\nthe sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the\nwindow. Yes, it was surely from the street that the\nfaint sound had come. \u201cAs to Holmes,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe can fool\nhim easily enough. You see, the damned fool\nwon\u2019t arrest us if he can get the stone. Well,\nwe\u2019ll promise him the stone. We\u2019ll put him on the\nwrong track about it, and before he \ufb01nds that it is\nthe wrong track it will be in Holland and we out\nof the country.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds good to me!\u201d cried Sam Merton\nwith a grin. \u201cYou go on and tell the Dutchman to get a\nmove on him. I\u2019ll see this sucker and \ufb01ll him up\nwith a bogus confession. I\u2019ll tell him that the stone\nis in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it\ngets on my nerves! By the time he \ufb01nds it isn\u2019t\nin Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the\nblue water. Come back here, out of a line with that\nkeyhole. Here is the stone.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder you dare carry it.\u201d\n\u201cWhere could I have it safer? If we could take\nit out of Whitehall someone else could surely take\nit out of my lodgings.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a look at it.\u201d\nCount Sylvius cast a somewhat un\ufb02attering\nglance at his associate and disregarded the un-\nwashed hand which was extended towards him. \u201cWhat\u2014d\u2019ye think I\u2019m going to snatch it off\nyou? See here, mister, I\u2019m getting a bit tired of\nyour ways.\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, no offence, Sam. We can\u2019t afford to\nquarrel. Come over to the window if you want to\nsee the beauty properly. Now hold it to the light!"

He held it now in one hand, while his other\npointed a revolver at the Count\u2019s head. The two\n886\nThe Adventure Of The Mazarin Stone\nvillains staggered back in utter amazement. Be-\nfore they had recovered Holmes had pressed the\nelectric bell. \u201cNo violence, gentlemen\u2014no violence, I beg of\nyou! Consider the furniture! It must be very clear\nto you that your position is an impossible one. The\npolice are waiting below.\u201d\nThe Count\u2019s bewilderment overmastered his\nrage and fear. \u201cBut how the deuce\u2014?\u201d he gasped. \u201cYour surprise is very natural. You are not\naware that a second door from my bedroom leads\nbehind that curtain. I fancied that you must have\nheard me when I displaced the \ufb01gure, but luck\nwas on my side. It gave me a chance of listen-\ning to your racy conversation which would have\nbeen painfully constrained had you been aware of\nmy presence.\u201d\nThe Count gave a gesture of resignation. \u201cWe give you best, Holmes. I believe you are\nthe devil himself.\u201d\n\u201cNot far from him, at any rate,\u201d Holmes an-\nswered with a polite smile. Sam Merton\u2019s slow intellect had only gradually\nappreciated the situation. Now, as the sound of\nheavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke\nsilence at last. \u201cA fair cop!\u201d said he. \u201cBut, I say, what about\nthat bloomin\u2019 \ufb01ddle! I hear it yet.\u201d\n\u201cTut, tut!\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cYou are per-\nfectly right. Let it play! These modern gramo-\nphones are a remarkable invention.\u201d\nThere was an inrush of police, the handcuffs\nclicked and the criminals were led to the waiting\ncab. Watson lingered with Holmes, congratulat-\ning him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by\nthe imperturbable Billy with his card-tray. \u201cLord Cantlemere, sir.\u201d\n\u201cShow him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer\nwho represents the very highest interests,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cHe is an excellent and loyal person, but\nrather of the old regime. Shall we make him un-\nbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He\nknows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has\noccurred.\u201d\nThe door opened to admit a thin, austere \ufb01gure\nwith a hatchet face and drooping mid-Victorian\nwhiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly cor-\nresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble\ngait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an un-\nresponsive hand. \u201cHow do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly\nfor the time of year, but rather warm indoors. May\nI take your overcoat?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I thank you; I will not take it off.\u201d\nHolmes laid his hand insistently upon the\nsleeve. \u201cPray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would\nassure you that these changes of temperature are\nmost insidious.\u201d\nHis Lordship shook himself free with some im-\npatience. \u201cI am quite comfortable, sir. I have no need to\nstay. I have simply looked in to know how your\nself-appointed task was progressing.\u201d\n\u201cIt is dif\ufb01cult\u2014very dif\ufb01cult.\u201d\n\u201cI feared that you would \ufb01nd it so.\u201d\nThere was a distinct sneer in the old courtier\u2019s\nwords and manner."

Possibly you could\nhelp me upon it?\u201d\n\u201cYou apply for my advice rather late in the\nday. I thought that you had your own all-suf\ufb01cient\nmethods.

Some of the\nancient \ufb01res \ufb02ickered up into his sallow cheeks. \u201cYou take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In \ufb01fty\nyears of of\ufb01cial life I cannot recall such a case. I\nam a busy man, sir, engaged upon important af-\nfairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes.

Your conduct\ncon\ufb01rms all my conclusions. I have the honour, sir,\nto wish you good-evening.\u201d\nHolmes had swiftly changed his position and\nwas between the peer and the door. \u201cOne moment, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cTo actually go off\nwith the Mazarin stone would be a more serious\noffence than to be found in temporary possession\nof it.\u201d\n\u201cSir, this is intolerable! Let me pass.\u201d\n\u201cPut your hand in the right-hand pocket of\nyour overcoat.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d\n\u201cCome\u2014come, do what I ask.\u201d\nAn instant later the amazed peer was standing,\nblinking and stammering, with the great yellow\nstone on his shaking palm. \u201cWhat! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cToo bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!\u201d cried\nHolmes. \u201cMy old friend here will tell you that I\nhave an impish habit of practical joking. Also that\nI can never resist a dramatic situation. I took the\nliberty\u2014the very great liberty, I admit\u2014of putting\nthe stone into your pocket at the beginning of our\ninterview.\u201d\nThe old peer stared from the stone to the smil-\ning face before him. \u201cSir, I am bewildered. But\u2014yes\u2014it is indeed\nthe Mazarin stone. We are greatly your debtors,\nMr. Holmes. Your sense of humour may, as you\nadmit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition\nremarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any\nre\ufb02ection I have made upon your amazing profes-\nsional powers. But how\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe case is but half \ufb01nished; the details can\nwait."

Billy, you will show his\nLordship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should\nbe glad if she would send up dinner for two as\nsoon as possible.\u201d\nThe Adventure of the Three Gables\nThe Adventure of the Three Gables\nI\ndon\u2019t think that any of my adventures\nwith Mr. Sherlock Holmes opened quite\nso abruptly, or so dramatically, as that\nwhich I associate with The Three Gables. I had not seen Holmes for some days and had no\nidea of the new channel into which his activities\nhad been directed. He was in a chatty mood that\nmorning, however, and had just settled me into the\nwell-worn low armchair on one side of the \ufb01re,\nwhile he had curled down with his pipe in his\nmouth upon the opposite chair, when our visitor\narrived. If I had said that a mad bull had arrived it\nwould give a clearer impression of what occurred. The door had \ufb02own open and a huge negro\nhad burst into the room. He would have been a\ncomic \ufb01gure if he had not been terri\ufb01c, for he was\ndressed in a very loud gray check suit with a \ufb02ow-\ning salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and \ufb02at-\ntened nose were thrust forward, as his sullen dark\neyes, with a smouldering gleam of malice in them,\nturned from one of us to the other. \u201cWhich of you gen\u2019l\u2019men is Masser Holmes?\u201d\nhe asked. Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile. \u201cOh! it\u2019s you, is it?\u201d said our visitor, coming\nwith an unpleasant, stealthy step round the angle\nof the table. \u201cSee here, Masser Holmes, you keep\nyour hands out of other folks\u2019 business. Leave\nfolks to manage their own affairs. Got that, Masser\nHolmes?\u201d\n\u201cKeep on talking,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt\u2019s \ufb01ne.\u201d\n\u201cOh! it\u2019s \ufb01ne, is it?\u201d growled the savage. \u201cIt\nwon\u2019t be so damn \ufb01ne if I have to trim you up a\nbit. I\u2019ve handled your kind before now, and they\ndidn\u2019t look \ufb01ne when I was through with them. Look at that, Masser Holmes!\u201d\nHe swung a huge knotted lump of a \ufb01st un-\nder my friend\u2019s nose. Holmes examined it closely\nwith an air of great interest. \u201cWere you born so?\u201d\nhe asked. \u201cOr did it come by degrees?\u201d\nIt may have been the icy coolness of my friend,\nor it may have been the slight clatter which I made\nas I picked up the poker. In any case, our visitor\u2019s\nmanner became less \ufb02amboyant. \u201cWell,\nI\u2019ve given you fair warnin\u2019,\u201d\nsaid\nhe. \u201cI\u2019ve a friend that\u2019s interested out Harrow\nway\u2014you know what I\u2019m meaning\u2014and he don\u2019t\nintend to have no buttin\u2019 in by you.

Three small projections above the upper windows\nmade a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind\nwas a grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and\nthe whole aspect of the place was poor and de-\npressing. None the less, we found the house to be\nwell furnished, and the lady who received us was\na most engaging elderly person, who bore every\nmark of re\ufb01nement and culture. \u201cI remember your husband well, madam,\u201d said\nHolmes, \u201cthough it is some years since he used my\nservices in some tri\ufb02ing matter.\u201d\n\u201cProbably you would be more familiar with the\nname of my son Douglas.\u201d\nHolmes looked at her with great interest. \u201cDear me! Are you the mother of Douglas\nMaberley? I knew him slightly. But of course all\nLondon knew him. What a magni\ufb01cent creature\nhe was! Where is he now?\u201d\n\u201cDead, Mr. Holmes, dead! He was attache\nat Rome, and he died there of pneumonia last\nmonth.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry. One could not connect death with\nsuch a man. I have never known anyone so vitally\nalive. He lived intensely\u2014every \ufb01bre of him!\u201d\n\u201cToo intensely, Mr. Holmes. That was the ruin\nof him. You remember him as he was\u2014debonair\nand splendid. You did not see the moody, morose,\nbrooding creature into which he developed. His\nheart was broken. In a single month I seemed to\nsee my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical\nman.\u201d\n\u201cA love affair\u2014a woman?\u201d\n\u201cOr a \ufb01end. Well, it was not to talk of my poor\nlad that I asked you to come, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Watson and I are at your service.\u201d\n\u201cThere have been some very strange happen-\nings. I have been in this house more than a year\nnow, and as I wished to lead a retired life I have\nseen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I had\na call from a man who said that he was a house\nagent. He said that this house would exactly suit a\nclient of his, and that if I would part with it money\nwould be no object. It seemed to me very strange\nas there are several empty houses on the market\nwhich appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I\nwas interested in what he said. I therefore named\na price which was \ufb01ve hundred pounds more than\nI gave. He at once closed with the offer, but added\nthat his client desired to buy the furniture as well\nand would I put a price upon it. Some of this fur-\nniture is from my old home, and it is, as you see,\nvery good, so that I named a good round sum."

And there\nthe matter was left, but the whole thing seemed to\nme to be so unusual that I thought\u2014\u201d\nHere we had a very extraordinary interruption. Holmes raised his hand for silence. Then he\nstrode across the room, \ufb02ung open the door, and\ndragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had\nseized by the shoulder. She entered with ungainly\n892\nThe Adventure of the Three Gables\nstruggle like some huge awkward chicken, torn,\nsquawking, out of its coop. \u201cLeave me alone! What are you a-doin\u2019 of?\u201d\nshe screeched. \u201cWhy, Susan, what is this?\u201d\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, I was comin\u2019 in to ask if the vis-\nitors was stayin\u2019 for lunch when this man jumped\nout at me.\u201d\n\u201cI have been listening to her for the last \ufb01ve\nminutes, but did not wish to interrupt your most\ninteresting narrative. Just a little wheezy, Susan,\nare you not? You breathe too heavily for that kind\nof work.\u201d\nSusan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her\ncaptor. \u201cWho be you, anyhow, and what right have\nyou a-pullin\u2019 me about like this?\u201d\n\u201cIt was merely that I wished to ask a question\nin your presence. Did you, Mrs. Maberley, men-\ntion to anyone that you were going to write to me\nand consult me?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mr. Holmes, I did not.\u201d\n\u201cWho posted your letter?\u201d\n\u201cSusan did.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Now, Susan, to whom was it that you\nwrote or sent a message to say that your mistress\nwas asking advice from me?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie. I sent no message.\u201d\n\u201cNow, Susan, wheezy people may not live long,\nyou know. It\u2019s a wicked thing to tell \ufb01bs. Whom\ndid you tell?\u201d\n\u201cSusan!\u201d cried her mistress, \u201cI believe you are\na bad, treacherous woman. I remember now that I\nsaw you speaking to someone over the hedge.\u201d\n\u201cThat was my own business,\u201d said the woman\nsullenly. \u201cSuppose I tell you that it was Barney Stock-\ndale to whom you spoke?\u201d said Holmes."

Of course, when people bury\ntreasure nowadays they do it in the Post-Of\ufb01ce\nbank. But there are always some lunatics about. It would be a dull world without them. At \ufb01rst I\nthought of some buried valuable. But why, in that\ncase, should they want your furniture? You don\u2019t\nhappen to have a Raphael or a \ufb01rst folio Shake-\nspeare without knowing it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I have anything rarer than a\nCrown Derby tea-set.\u201d\n\u201cThat would hardly justify all this mystery. Be-\nsides, why should they not openly state what they\nwant? If they covet your tea-set, they can surely\noffer a price for it without buying you out, lock,\nstock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is some-\nthing which you do not know that you have, and\nwhich you would not give up if you did know.\u201d\n\u201cThat is how I read it,\u201d said I. \u201cDr. Watson agrees, so that settles it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?\u201d\n\u201cLet us see whether by this purely mental anal-\nysis we can get it to a \ufb01ner point. You have been\nin this house a year.\u201d\n\u201cNearly two.\u201d\n\u201cAll the better. During this long period no\none wants anything from you. Now suddenly\nwithin three or four days you have urgent de-\nmands. What would you gather from that?\u201d\n\u201cIt can only mean,\u201d said I, \u201cthat the object,\nwhatever it may be, has only just come into the\nhouse.\u201d\n893\nThe Adventure of the Three Gables\n\u201cSettled once again,\u201d said Holmes."

The labels\nshone out upon them. \u201c \u2018Milano.\u2019 \u2018Lucerne.\u2019 These are from Italy.\u201d\n\u201cThey are poor Douglas\u2019s things.\u201d\n\u201cYou have not unpacked them?

How do we know that there is not\nsomething of value there?\u201d\n\u201cThere could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes. Poor Douglas had only his pay and a small an-\nnuity. What could he have of value?\u201d\nHolmes was lost in thought. \u201cDelay no longer, Mrs. Maberley,\u201d he said at\nlast. \u201cHave these things taken upstairs to your\nbedroom. Examine them as soon as possible and\nsee what they contain. I will come to-morrow and\nhear your report.\u201d\nIt was quite evident that The Three Gables\nwas under very close surveillance, for as we came\nround the high hedge at the end of the lane\nthere was the negro prize-\ufb01ghter standing in the\nshadow. We came on him quite suddenly, and a\ngrim and menacing \ufb01gure he looked in that lonely\nplace. Holmes clapped his hand to his pocket. \u201cLookin\u2019 for your gun, Masser Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cNo, for my scent-bottle, Steve.\u201d\n\u201cYou are funny, Masser Holmes, ain\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be funny for you, Steve, if I get after\nyou. I gave you fair warning this morning.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over\nwhat you said, and I don\u2019t want no more talk\nabout that affair of Masser Perkins. S\u2019pose I can\nhelp you, Masser Holmes, I will.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, tell me who is behind you on this\njob.\u201d\n\u201cSo help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told\nyou the truth before.

It was lucky I had\nsome knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and\nthat Steve was one of them. Now, Watson, this is\na case for Langdale Pike, and I am going to see\nhim now. When I get back I may be clearer in the\nmatter.\u201d\nI saw no more of Holmes during the day, but\nI could well imagine how he spent it, for Lang-\ndale Pike was his human book of reference upon\nall matters of social scandal. This strange, lan-\nguid creature spent his waking hours in the bow\nwindow of a St. James\u2019s Street club and was the\nreceiving-station as well as the transmitter for all\nthe gossip of the metropolis. He made, it was said,\na four-\ufb01gure income by the paragraphs which\nhe contributed every week to the garbage papers\nwhich cater to an inquisitive public. If ever, far\ndown in the turbid depths of London life, there\nwas some strange swirl or eddy, it was marked\nwith automatic exactness by this human dial upon\nthe surface. Holmes discreetly helped Langdale to\nknowledge, and on occasion was helped in turn. When I met my friend in his room early next\nmorning, I was conscious from his bearing that all\nwas well, but none the less a most unpleasant sur-\nprise was awaiting us. It took the shape of the\nfollowing telegram:\n894\nThe Adventure of the Three Gables\nPlease come out at once. Client\u2019s\nhouse burgled in the night. Police in\npossession. \u2014 Sutro. Holmes whistled. \u201cThe drama has come to a\ncrisis, and quicker than I had expected. There is\na great driving-power at the back of this business,\nWatson, which does not surprise me after what I\nhave heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I\nmade a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend\nthe night on guard. This fellow has clearly proved\na broken reed. Well, there is nothing for it but an-\nother journey to Harrow Weald.\u201d\nWe found The Three Gables a very different es-\ntablishment to the orderly household of the previ-\nous day. A small group of idlers had assembled\nat the garden gate, while a couple of constables\nwere examining the windows and the geranium\nbeds. Within we met a gray old gentleman, who\nintroduced himself as the lawyer, together with a\nbustling, rubicund inspector, who greeted Holmes\nas an old friend. \u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this\ncase, I\u2019m afraid. Just a common, ordinary burglary,\nand well within the capacity of the poor old police. No experts need apply.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure the case is in very good hands,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cMerely a common burglary, you say?\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. We know pretty well who the men\nare and where to \ufb01nd them."

Mrs.\nMaberley was chloroformed and the house was\u2014\nAh! here is the lady herself.\u201d\nOur friend of yesterday, looking very pale and\nill, had entered the room, leaning upon a little\nmaidservant. \u201cYou gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said\nshe, smiling ruefully. \u201cAlas, I did not take it!

I have no doubt\nthat wicked Susan had planned an entrance for\nthem. They must have known the house to an\ninch. I was conscious for a moment of the chlo-\nroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but\nI have no notion how long I may have been sense-\nless. When I woke, one man was at the bedside\nand another was rising with a bundle in his hand\nfrom among my son\u2019s baggage, which was par-\ntially opened and littered over the \ufb02oor. Before he\ncould get away I sprang up and seized him.\u201d\n\u201cYou took a big risk,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cI clung to him, but he shook me off, and the\nother may have struck me, for I can remember no\nmore.

That brought the\npolice, but the rascals had got away.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did they take?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think there is anything of value\nmissing. I am sure there was nothing in my son\u2019s\ntrunks.\u201d\n\u201cDid the men leave no clue?\u201d\n\u201cThere was one sheet of paper which I may\nhave torn from the man that I grasped. It was ly-\ning all crumpled on the \ufb02oor. It is in my son\u2019s\nhandwriting.\u201d\n\u201cWhich means that it is not of much use,\u201d said\nthe inspector. \u201cNow if it had been in the bur-\nglar\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWhat rugged com-\nmon sense! None the less, I should be curious to\nsee it.\u201d\nThe inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap\nfrom his pocketbook. \u201cI never pass anything, however tri\ufb02ing,\u201d said\nhe with some pomposity. \u201cThat is my advice to\nyou, Mr. Holmes. In twenty-\ufb01ve years\u2019 experi-\nence I have learned my lesson. There is always\nthe chance of \ufb01nger-marks or something.\u201d\nHolmes inspected the sheet of paper. \u201cWhat do you make of it, Inspector?\u201d\n\u201cSeems to be the end of some queer novel, so\nfar as I can see.\u201d\n\u201cIt may certainly prove to be the end of a queer\ntale,\u201d said Holmes."

I only gather that\nwe are going to see the lady who is behind all this\nmischief.\u201d\n\u201cExactly! But does the name Isadora Klein\nconvey nothing to you? She was, of course, the\ncelebrated beauty. There was never a woman to\ntouch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of\nthe masterful Conquistadors, and her people have\nbeen leaders in Pernambuco for generations. She\nmarried the aged German sugar king, Klein, and\npresently found herself the richest as well as the\nmost lovely widow upon earth. Then there was an\ninterval of adventure when she pleased her own\ntastes. She had several lovers, and Douglas Maber-\nley, one of the most striking men in London, was\none of them.

I am ready to listen, and then I\nwill tell you how I will act.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a\nbrave man like yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was really foolish, madame, is that you\nhave placed yourself in the power of a band of ras-\ncals who may blackmail or give you away.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no! I am not so simple. Since I have\npromised to be frank, I may say that no one, save\nBarney Stockdale and Susan, his wife, have the\nleast idea who their employer is.

I shall not appear in the\nmatter.\u201d\n\u201cUnless I bring you into it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, you would not. You are a gentleman. It is a woman\u2019s secret.\u201d\n\u201cIn the \ufb01rst place, you must give back this\nmanuscript.\u201d\nShe broke into a ripple of laughter and walked\nto the \ufb01replace. There was a calcined mass which\nshe broke up with the poker. \u201cShall I give this\nback?\u201d she asked. So roguish and exquisite did\nshe look as she stood before us with a challenging\nsmile that I felt of all Holmes\u2019s criminals this was\nthe one whom he would \ufb01nd it hardest to face. However, he was immune from sentiment. \u201cThat seals your fate,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cYou\nare very prompt in your actions, madame, but you\nhave overdone it on this occasion.\u201d\nShe threw the poker down with a clatter. \u201cHow hard you are!\u201d she cried. \u201cMay I tell you\nthe whole story?\u201d\n\u201cI fancy I could tell it to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut you must look at it with my eyes, Mr.\nHolmes."

But what do we know about\nvampires? Does it come within our purview ei-\nther? Anything is better than stagnation, but really\nwe seem to have been switched on to a Grimms\u2019\nfairy tale. Make a long arm, Watson, and see what\nV has to say.\u201d\nI leaned back and took down the great index\nvolume to which he referred.

It concerns a friend\nfor whom I am acting. This gentleman\nmarried some \ufb01ve years ago a Peruvian\nlady, the daughter of a Peruvian mer-\nchant, whom he had met in connection\nwith the importation of nitrates. The\nlady was very beautiful, but the fact\nof her foreign birth and of her alien\nreligion always caused a separation of\ninterests and of feelings between hus-\nband and wife, so that after a time his\nlove may have cooled towards her and\nhe may have come to regard their union\nas a mistake. He felt there were sides of\nher character which he could never ex-\nplore or understand. This was the more\npainful as she was as loving a wife as a\nman could have\u2014to all appearance ab-\nsolutely devoted. Now for the point which I will make\nmore plain when we meet. Indeed,\nthis note is merely to give you a gen-\neral idea of the situation and to ascer-\ntain whether you would care to interest\nyourself in the matter."

        "text": "The lady began\nto show some curious traits quite alien\nto her ordinarily sweet and gentle dis-\nposition. The gentleman had been mar-\nried twice and he had one son by the\n\ufb01rst wife. This boy was now \ufb01fteen, a\nvery charming and affectionate youth,\nthough unhappily injured through an\naccident in childhood. Twice the wife\nwas caught in the act of assaulting this\npoor lad in the most unprovoked way. Once she struck him with a stick and\nleft a great weal on his arm. This was a small matter, however,\ncompared with her conduct to her own\nchild, a dear boy just under one year of\nage. On one occasion about a month\nago this child had been left by its nurse\nfor a few minutes. A loud cry from\nthe baby, as of pain, called the nurse\nback. As she ran into the room she saw\nher employer, the lady, leaning over the\nbaby and apparently biting his neck. There was a small wound in the neck\nfrom which a stream of blood had es-\ncaped. The nurse was so horri\ufb01ed that\nshe wished to call the husband, but the\nlady implored her not to do so and ac-\ntually gave her \ufb01ve pounds as a price\nfor her silence. No explanation was\never given, and for the moment the\nmatter was passed over. It left, however, a terrible impression\nupon the nurse\u2019s mind, and from that\ntime she began to watch her mistress\nclosely and to keep a closer guard upon\nthe baby, whom she tenderly loved. It\nseemed to her that even as she watched\nthe mother, so the mother watched her,\nand that every time she was compelled\nto leave the baby alone the mother was\nwaiting to get at it. Day and night\nthe nurse covered the child, and day\nand night the silent, watchful mother\nseemed to be lying in wait as a wolf\nwaits for a lamb. It must read most in-\ncredible to you, and yet I beg you to\ntake it seriously, for a child\u2019s life and a\nman\u2019s sanity may depend upon it. At last there came one dreadful day\nwhen the facts could no longer be con-\ncealed from the husband. The nurse\u2019s\nnerve had given way; she could stand\nthe strain no longer, and she made a\nclean breast of it all to the man. To\nhim it seemed as wild a tale as it may\nnow seem to you. He knew his wife\nto be a loving wife, and, save for the\nassaults upon her stepson, a loving\nmother. Why, then, should she wound\nher own dear little baby? He told the\nnurse that she was dreaming, that her\nsuspicions were those of a lunatic, and\nthat such libels upon her mistress were\nnot to be tolerated. While they were\ntalking a sudden cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to\nthe nursery. Imagine his feelings, Mr.\nHolmes, as he saw his wife rise from\na kneeling position beside the cot and\nsaw blood upon the child\u2019s exposed\nneck and upon the sheet."

I had remembered him as a\nlong, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a \ufb01ne\nturn of speed which had carried him round many\nan opposing back. There is surely nothing in life\nmore painful than to meet the wreck of a \ufb01ne ath-\nlete whom one has known in his prime. His great\nframe had fallen in, his \ufb02axen hair was scanty, and\nhis shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused cor-\nresponding emotions in him. \u201cHullo, Watson,\u201d said he, and his voice was\nstill deep and hearty. \u201cYou don\u2019t look quite the\nman you did when I threw you over the ropes\ninto the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I\nhave changed a bit also. But it\u2019s this last day or\ntwo that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr.\nHolmes, that it is no use my pretending to be any-\none\u2019s deputy.\u201d\n\u201cIt is simpler to deal direct,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cOf course it is.

She\nwas cut to the heart that I should have discovered\nthis horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not\neven speak.

I can give you my undivided energies. Watson, of course, comes with us. But there are\none or two points upon which I wish to be very\nsure before I start. This unhappy lady, as I under-\nstand it, has appeared to assault both the children,\nher own baby and your little son?\u201d\n\u201cThat is so.\u201d\n\u201cBut the assaults take different forms, do they\nnot?

Did he give you\nno explanation of these assaults?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he declared there was no reason.\u201d\n\u201cWere they good friends at other times?\u201d\n\u201cNo, there was never any love between them.\u201d\n\u201cYet you say he is affectionate?\u201d\n\u201cNever in the world could there be so devoted\na son. My life is his life. He is absorbed in what I\nsay or do.\u201d\nOnce again Holmes made a note. For some\ntime he sat lost in thought. \u201cNo doubt you and the boy were great com-\nrades before this second marriage. You were\nthrown very close together, were you not?\u201d\n\u201cVery much so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the boy, having so affectionate a nature,\nwas devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his\nmother?\u201d\n\u201cMost devoted.\u201d\n\u201cHe would certainly seem to be a most inter-\nesting lad. There is one other point about these as-\nsaults. Were the strange attacks upon the baby and\nthe assaults upon your son at the same period?\u201d\n\u201cIn the \ufb01rst case it was so. It was as if some\nfrenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage\nupon both. In the second case it was only Jack who\nsuffered. Mrs. Mason had no complaint to make\nabout the baby.\u201d\n\u201cThat certainly complicates matters.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite follow you, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly not. One forms provisional theories\nand waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode\nthem. A bad habit, Mr. Ferguson, but human na-\nture is weak. I fear that your old friend here has\ngiven an exaggerated view of my scienti\ufb01c meth-\nods. However, I will only say at the present stage\nthat your problem does not appear to me to be\ninsoluble, and that you may expect to \ufb01nd us at\nVictoria at two o\u2019clock.\u201d\nIt was evening of a dull, foggy November day\nwhen, having left our bags at the Chequers, Lam-\nberley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a long\nwinding lane and \ufb01nally reached the isolated and\nancient farmhouse in which Ferguson dwelt."

They were ornamented, however, on the\nlower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-\ncolours; while above, where yellow plaster took\nthe place of oak, there was hung a \ufb01ne collection\nof South American utensils and weapons, which\nhad been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady\nupstairs. Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity\nwhich sprang from his eager mind, and examined\nthem with some care. He returned with his eyes\nfull of thought. \u201cHullo!\u201d he cried. \u201cHullo!\u201d\nA spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. It came slowly forward towards its master, walk-\ning with dif\ufb01culty. Its hind legs moved irregularly\nand its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson\u2019s\nhand. \u201cWhat is it, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cThe dog. What\u2019s the matter with it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what puzzled the vet. A sort of paral-\nysis. Spinal meningitis, he thought. But it is pass-\ning. He\u2019ll be all right soon\u2014won\u2019t you, Carlo?\u201d\nA shiver of assent passed through the drooping\ntail. The dog\u2019s mournful eyes passed from one of\nus to the other. He knew that we were discussing\nhis case. \u201cDid it come on suddenly?\u201d\n\u201cIn a single night.\u201d\n\u201cHow long ago?\u201d\n\u201cIt may have been four months ago.\u201d\n\u201cVery remarkable. Very suggestive.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you see in it, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cA\ncon\ufb01rmation\nof\nwhat\nI\nhad\nalready\nthought.\u201d\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, what do you think, Mr.\nHolmes? It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to\nyou, but it is life and death to me! My wife a\nwould-be murderer\u2014my child in constant danger! Don\u2019t play with me, Mr. Holmes. It is too terribly\nserious.\u201d\nThe big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all\nover. Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his\narm. \u201cI fear that there is pain for you, Mr. Ferguson,\nwhatever the solution may be,\u201d said he. \u201cI would\nspare you all I can. I cannot say more for the in-\nstant, but before I leave this house I hope I may\nhave something de\ufb01nite.\u201d\n\u201cPlease God you may! If you will excuse me,\ngentlemen, I will go up to my wife\u2019s room and see\nif there has been any change.\u201d\nHe was away some minutes, during which\nHolmes resumed his examination of the curiosi-\nties upon the wall."

He brought with him a tall, slim, brown-\nfaced girl. \u201cThe tea is ready, Dolores,\u201d said Ferguson. \u201cSee that your mistress has everything she can\nwish.\u201d\n\u201cShe verra ill,\u201d cried the girl, looking with in-\ndignant eyes at her master. \u201cShe no ask for food.

I no ask leave. She needs doctor.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll come with you at once.\u201d\nI followed the girl, who was quivering with\nstrong emotion, up the staircase and down an an-\ncient corridor. At the end was an iron-clamped\nand massive door. It struck me as I looked at it\nthat if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife\nhe would \ufb01nd it no easy matter. The girl drew a\nkey from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks\ncreaked upon their old hinges. I passed in and she\nswiftly followed, fastening the door behind her. On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly\nin a high fever. She was only half conscious, but as\nI entered she raised a pair of frightened but beauti-\nful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. Seeing\na stranger, she appeared to be relieved and sank\nback with a sigh upon the pillow. I stepped up to\nher with a few reassuring words, and she lay still\nwhile I took her pulse and temperature. Both were\nhigh, and yet my impression was that the condi-\ntion was rather that of mental and nervous excite-\nment than of any actual seizure. \u201cShe lie like that one day, two day. I \u2019fraid she\ndie,\u201d said the girl. The woman turned her \ufb02ushed and handsome\nface towards me. \u201cWhere is my husband?\u201d\n\u201cHe is below and would wish to see you.\u201d\n\u201cI will not see him. I will not see him.\u201d Then\nshe seemed to wander off into delirium. \u201cA \ufb01end! A \ufb01end! Oh, what shall I do with this devil?\u201d\n\u201cCan I help you in any way?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No one can help. It is \ufb01nished. All is\ndestroyed. Do what I will, all is destroyed.\u201d\n905\nThe Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\nThe woman must have some strange delusion. I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the charac-\nter of \ufb01end or devil. \u201cMadame,\u201d I said, \u201cyour husband loves you\ndearly. He is deeply grieved at this happening.\u201d\nAgain she turned on me those glorious eyes. \u201cHe loves me. Yes. But do I not love him? Do\nI not love him even to sacri\ufb01ce myself rather than\nbreak his dear heart? That is how I love him. And\nyet he could think of me\u2014he could speak of me\nso.\u201d\n\u201cHe is full of grief, but he cannot understand.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he cannot understand."

Go\nnow. You can do nothing for me. Tell him only\none thing. I want my child. I have a right to my\nchild. That is the only message I can send him.\u201d\nShe turned her face to the wall and would say no\nmore. I returned to the room downstairs, where Fer-\nguson and Holmes still sat by the \ufb01re. Ferguson\nlistened moodily to my account of the interview. \u201cHow can I send her the child?\u201d he said. \u201cHow\ndo I know what strange impulse might come upon\nher? How can I ever forget how she rose from\nbeside it with its blood upon her lips?\u201d He shud-\ndered at the recollection. \u201cThe child is safe with\nMrs. Mason, and there he must remain.\u201d\nA smart maid, the only modern thing which\nwe had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. As she was serving it the door opened and a youth\nentered the room. He was a remarkable lad, pale-\nfaced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes\nwhich blazed into a sudden \ufb02ame of emotion and\njoy as they rested upon his father. He rushed for-\nward and threw his arms round his neck with the\nabandon of a loving girl. \u201cOh, daddy,\u201d he cried, \u201cI did not know that\nyou were due yet. I should have been here to meet\nyou. Oh, I am so glad to see you!\u201d\nFerguson gently disengaged himself from the\nembrace with some little show of embarrassment. \u201cDear old chap,\u201d said he, patting the \ufb02axen\nhead with a very tender hand. \u201cI came early be-\ncause my friends, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson,\nhave been persuaded to come down and spend an\nevening with us.\u201d\n\u201cIs that Mr. Holmes, the detective?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe youth looked at us with a very penetrating\nand, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze. \u201cWhat about your other child, Mr. Ferguson?\u201d\nasked Holmes. \u201cMight we make the acquaintance\nof the baby?\u201d\n\u201cAsk Mrs. Mason to bring baby down,\u201d said\nFerguson. The boy went off with a curious, sham-\nbling gait which told my surgical eyes that he\nwas suffering from a weak spine. Presently he re-\nturned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman\nbearing in her arms a very beautiful child, dark-\neyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the\nSaxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently de-\nvoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled\nit most tenderly. \u201cFancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,\u201d\nhe muttered as he glanced down at the small, an-\ngry red pucker upon the cherub throat. It was at this moment that I chanced to glance\nat Holmes and saw a most singular intentness in\nhis expression. His face was as set as if it had been\ncarved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had\nglanced for a moment at father and child, were\nnow \ufb01xed with eager curiosity upon something at\nthe other side of the room."

It is true that a shutter had half closed outside\nand obstructed the view, but none the less it was\ncertainly at the window that Holmes was \ufb01xing\nhis concentrated attention. Then he smiled, and\nhis eyes came back to the baby. On its chubby\nneck there was this small puckered mark. Without\nspeaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally\nhe shook one of the dimpled \ufb01sts which waved in\nfront of him. \u201cGood-bye, little man. You have made a\nstrange start in life. Nurse, I should wish to have\na word with you in private.\u201d\nHe took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few\nminutes. I only heard the last words, which were:\n\u201cYour anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.\u201d\nThe woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind\nof creature, withdrew with the child. \u201cWhat is Mrs. Mason like?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cNot very prepossessing externally, as you can\nsee, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child.\u201d\n\u201cDo you like her, Jack?\u201d Holmes turned sud-\ndenly upon the boy. His expressive mobile face\nshadowed over, and he shook his head. \u201cJacky has very strong likes and dislikes,\u201d said\nFerguson, putting his arm round the boy. \u201cLuckily\nI am one of his likes.\u201d\n906\nThe Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\nThe boy cooed and nestled his head upon his\nfather\u2019s breast.

I had,\nin fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and\nthe rest has merely been observation and con\ufb01r-\nmation.\u201d\nFerguson put his big hand to his furrowed fore-\nhead. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Holmes,\u201d he said hoarsely;\n\u201cif you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep\nme in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts\nso long as you have really got them.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly I owe you an explanation, and you\nshall have it.

Will you have the good-\nness to give the lady this note?\u201d\nI ascended again and handed the note to Do-\nlores, who cautiously opened the door. A minute\nlater I heard a cry from within, a cry in which\njoy and surprise seemed to be blended. Dolores\nlooked out. \u201cShe will see them. She will leesten,\u201d said she. At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came\nup. As we entered the room Ferguson took a step\nor two towards his wife, who had raised herself in\nthe bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an armchair, while Holmes seated\nhimself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who\nlooked at him with wide-eyed amazement. \u201cI think we can dispense with Dolores,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cOh, very well, madame, if you would\nrather she stayed I can see no objection. Now,\nMr. Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls,\nand my methods have to be short and direct. The\nswiftest surgery is the least painful. Let me \ufb01rst\nsay what will ease your mind.

Everything on earth is insigni\ufb01cant compared to\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cLet me tell you, then, the train of reasoning\nwhich passed through my mind in Baker Street. The idea of a vampire was to me absurd. Such\nthings do not happen in criminal practice in Eng-\nland. And yet your observation was precise. You\nhad seen the lady rise from beside the child\u2019s cot\nwith the blood upon her lips.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cDid it not occur to you that a bleeding wound\nmay be sucked for some other purpose than to\ndraw the blood from it? Was there not a queen\nin English history who sucked such a wound to\ndraw poison from it?\u201d\n\u201cPoison!\u201d\n\u201cA South American household. My instinct felt\nthe presence of those weapons upon the wall be-\nfore my eyes ever saw them. It might have been\nother poison, but that was what occurred to me. When I saw that little empty quiver beside the\nsmall bird-bow, it was just what I expected to see. If the child were pricked with one of those arrows\ndipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it\nwould mean death if the venom were not sucked\nout. \u201cAnd the dog! If one were to use such a poi-\nson, would one not try it \ufb01rst in order to see that\nit had not lost its power?"

Mr. John\nGarrideb, Counsellor at Law, was a short, powerful\nman with the round, fresh, clean-shaven face char-\nacteristic of so many American men of affairs.

I\u2019ll give you the facts as short as I can make\nthem. If you came from Kansas I would not need\nto explain to you who Alexander Hamilton Gar-\nrideb was. He made his money in real estate,\nand afterwards in the wheat pit at Chicago, but he\nspent it in buying up as much land as would make\none of your counties, lying along the Arkansas\nRiver, west of Fort Dodge. It\u2019s grazing-land\nand lumber-land and arable-land and mineralized-\nland, and just every sort of land that brings dollars\nto the man that owns it. \u201cHe had no kith nor kin\u2014or, if he had, I never\nheard of it. But he took a kind of pride in the\nqueerness of his name. That was what brought us\ntogether. I was in the law at Topeka, and one day\nI had a visit from the old man, and he was tickled\nto death to meet another man with his own name. It was his pet fad, and he was dead set to \ufb01nd\nout if there were any more Garridebs in the world. \u2018Find me another!\u2019 said he. I told him I was a busy\nman and could not spend my life hiking round the\nworld in search of Garridebs. \u2018None the less,\u2019 said\nhe, \u2018that is just what you will do if things pan out\nas I planned them.\u2019 I thought he was joking, but\nthere was a powerful lot of meaning in the words,\nas I was soon to discover. \u201cFor he died within a year of saying them, and\nhe left a will behind him. It was the queerest will\nthat has ever been \ufb01led in the State of Kansas. His\nproperty was divided into three parts, and I was to\nhave one on condition that I found two Garridebs\nwho would share the remainder. It\u2019s \ufb01ve million\ndollars for each if it is a cent, but we can\u2019t lay a\n\ufb01nger on it until we all three stand in a row. \u201cIt was so big a chance that I just let my le-\ngal practice slide and I set forth looking for Gar-\nridebs. There is not one in the United States. I\nwent through it, sir, with a \ufb01ne-toothed comb and\nnever a Garrideb could I catch. Then I tried the\nold country. Sure enough there was the name in\nthe London telephone directory. I went after him\ntwo days ago and explained the whole matter to\nhim."

I used to have a\ncorrespondent\u2014he is dead now\u2014old Dr. Lysander\nStarr, who was mayor in 1890.\u201d\n\u201cGood old Dr. Starr!\u201d said our visitor. \u201cHis\nname is still honoured. Well, Mr. Holmes, I sup-\npose all we can do is to report to you and let\nyou know how we progress. I reckon you will\nhear within a day or two.\u201d With this assurance our\nAmerican bowed and departed. Holmes had lit his pipe, and he sat for some\ntime with a curious smile upon his face. \u201cWell?\u201d I asked at last. \u201cI am wondering, Watson\u2014just wondering!\u201d\n\u201cAt what?\u201d\nHolmes took his pipe from his lips. \u201cI was wondering, Watson, what on earth\ncould be the object of this man in telling us such a\nrigmarole of lies. I nearly asked him so\u2014for there\nare times when a brutal frontal attack is the best\n912\nThe Adventure of the Three Garridebs\npolicy\u2014but I judged it better to let him think he\nhad fooled us. Here is a man with an English\ncoat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the\nknee with a year\u2019s wear, and yet by this document\nand by his own account he is a provincial Ameri-\ncan lately landed in London. There have been no\nadvertisements in the agony columns. You know\nthat I miss nothing there. They are my favourite\ncovert for putting up a bird, and I would never\nhave overlooked such a cock pheasant as that. I\nnever knew a Dr. Lysander Starr, of Topeka. Touch\nhim where you would he was false. I think the\nfellow is really an American, but he has worn his\naccent smooth with years of London. What is his\ngame, then, and what motive lies behind this pre-\nposterous search for Garridebs? It\u2019s worth our at-\ntention, for, granting that the man is a rascal, he is\ncertainly a complex and ingenious one. We must\nnow \ufb01nd out if our other correspondent is a fraud\nalso. Just ring him up, Watson.\u201d\nI did so, and heard a thin, quavering voice at\nthe other end of the line. \u201cYes, yes, I am Mr. Nathan Garrideb. Is Mr.\nHolmes there? I should very much like to have a\nword with Mr. Holmes.\u201d\nMy friend took the instrument and I heard the\nusual syncopated dialogue."

The particular house to which we were di-\nrected was a large, old-fashioned, Early Georgian\nedi\ufb01ce, with a \ufb02at brick face broken only by two\ndeep bay windows on the ground \ufb02oor. It was on\nthis ground \ufb02oor that our client lived, and, indeed,\nthe low windows proved to be the front of the\nhuge room in which he spent his waking hours. Holmes pointed as we passed to the small brass\nplate which bore the curious name. \u201cUp some years, Watson,\u201d he remarked, indi-\ncating its discoloured surface. \u201cIt\u2019s his real name,\nanyhow, and that is something to note.\u201d\nThe house had a common stair, and there were\na number of names painted in the hall, some indi-\ncating of\ufb01ces and some private chambers. It was\nnot a collection of residential \ufb02ats, but rather the\nabode of Bohemian bachelors. Our client opened\nthe door for us himself and apologized by saying\nthat the woman in charge left at four o\u2019clock. Mr.\nNathan Garrideb proved to be a very tall, loose-\njointed, round-backed person, gaunt and bald,\nsome sixty-odd years of age. He had a cadaverous\nface, with the dull dead skin of a man to whom\nexercise was unknown. Large round spectacles\nand a small projecting goat\u2019s beard combined with\nhis stooping attitude to give him an expression of\npeering curiosity. The general effect, however, was\namiable, though eccentric. The room was as curious as its occupant. It\nlooked like a small museum. It was both broad\nand deep, with cupboards and cabinets all round,\ncrowded with specimens, geological and anatom-\nical. Cases of butter\ufb02ies and moths \ufb02anked each\nside of the entrance. A large table in the centre was\nlittered with all sorts of debris, while the tall brass\ntube of a powerful microscope bristled up among\nthem. As I glanced round I was surprised at the\nuniversality of the man\u2019s interests. Here was a case\nof ancient coins. There was a cabinet of \ufb02int instru-\nments. Behind his central table was a large cup-\nboard of fossil bones."

That is our bird, Watson\u2014a\nsporting bird, as you must admit.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is his game?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it begins to de\ufb01ne itself. I have been to\nthe house-agent\u2019s. Our client, as he told us, has\nbeen there \ufb01ve years. It was unlet for a year be-\nfore then. The previous tenant was a gentleman at\nlarge named Waldron. Waldron\u2019s appearance was\nwell remembered at the of\ufb01ce. He had suddenly\nvanished and nothing more been heard of him. He was a tall, bearded man with very dark fea-\ntures. Now, Prescott, the man whom Killer Evans\nhad shot, was, according to Scotland Yard, a tall,\ndark man with a beard. As a working hypothesis,\nI think we may take it that Prescott, the American\ncriminal, used to live in the very room which our\ninnocent friend now devotes to his museum.

Mrs. Saun-\nders, the caretaker, was about to leave, but she had\nno hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut\nwith a spring lock, and Holmes promised to see\nthat all was safe before we left. Shortly afterwards\nthe outer door closed, her bonnet passed the bow\nwindow, and we knew that we were alone in the\nlower \ufb02oor of the house. Holmes made a rapid\nexamination of the premises. There was one cup-\nboard in a dark corner which stood out a little\nfrom the wall. It was behind this that we eventu-\nally crouched while Holmes in a whisper outlined\nhis intentions. \u201cHe wanted to get our amiable friend out of\nhis room\u2014that is very clear, and, as the collector\nnever went out, it took some planning to do it. The\nwhole of this Garrideb invention was apparently\nfor no other end. I must say, Watson, that there\nis a certain devilish ingenuity about it, even if the\nqueer name of the tenant did give him an opening\nwhich he could hardly have expected.

At \ufb01rst I thought our friend might\nhave something in his collection more valuable\nthan he knew\u2014something worth the attention of\na big criminal. But the fact that Rodger Prescott of\nevil memory inhabited these rooms points to some\ndeeper reason. Well, Watson, we can but possess\nour souls in patience and see what the hour may\nbring.\u201d\nThat hour was not long in striking. We\ncrouched closer in the shadow as we heard the\nouter door open and shut. Then came the sharp,\nmetallic snap of a key, and the American was in\nthe room. He closed the door softly behind him,\ntook a sharp glance around him to see that all was\nsafe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the\n916\nThe Adventure of the Three Garridebs\ncentral table with the brisk manner of one who\nknows exactly what he has to do and how to do\nit. He pushed the table to one side, tore up the\nsquare of carpet on which it rested, rolled it com-\npletely back, and then, drawing a jemmy from his\ninside pocket, he knelt down and worked vigor-\nously upon the \ufb02oor. Presently we heard the sound\nof sliding boards, and an instant later a square had\nopened in the planks. Killer Evans struck a match,\nlit a stump of candle, and vanished from our view. Clearly our moment had come. Holmes\ntouched my wrist as a signal, and together we\nstole across to the open trap-door. Gently as we\nmoved, however, the old \ufb02oor must have creaked\nunder our feet, for the head of our American, peer-\ning anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the\nopen space. His face turned upon us with a glare\nof baf\ufb02ed rage, which gradually softened into a\nrather shamefaced grin as he realized that two pis-\ntols were pointed at his head. \u201cWell, well!\u201d said he coolly as he scrambled to\nthe surface. \u201cI guess you have been one too many\nfor me, Mr. Holmes. Saw through my game, I sup-\npose, and played me for a sucker from the \ufb01rst. Well, sir, I hand it to you; you have me beat and\u2014\u201d\nIn an instant he had whisked out a revolver\nfrom his breast and had \ufb01red two shots. I felt\na sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had been\npressed to my thigh. There was a crash as\nHolmes\u2019s pistol came down on the man\u2019s head. I\nhad a vision of him sprawling upon the \ufb02oor with\nblood running down his face while Holmes rum-\nmaged him for weapons. Then my friend\u2019s wiry\narms were round me, and he was leading me to a\nchair. \u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, Watson?"

The clear, hard\neyes were dimmed for a moment, and the \ufb01rm lips\nwere shaking. For the one and only time I caught a\nglimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service\nculminated in that moment of revelation. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Holmes. It\u2019s a mere scratch.\u201d\nHe had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-\nknife. \u201cYou are right,\u201d he cried with an immense sigh\nof relief. \u201cIt is quite super\ufb01cial.\u201d His face set like\n\ufb02int as he glared at our prisoner, who was sitting\nup with a dazed face. \u201cBy the Lord, it is as well for\nyou.

I leaned on Holmes\u2019s arm, and to-\ngether we looked down into the small cellar which\nhad been disclosed by the secret \ufb02ap. It was still\nilluminated by the candle which Evans had taken\ndown with him. Our eyes fell upon a mass of\nrusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of\nbottles, and, neatly arranged upon a small table, a\nnumber of neat little bundles. \u201cA printing press\u2014a counterfeiter\u2019s out\ufb01t,\u201d\nsaid Holmes. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said our prisoner, staggering slowly\nto his feet and then sinking into the chair. \u201cThe\ngreatest counterfeiter London ever saw. That\u2019s\nPrescott\u2019s machine, and those bundles on the table\nare two thousand of Prescott\u2019s notes worth a hun-\ndred each and \ufb01t to pass anywhere. Help your-\nselves, gentlemen. Call it a deal and let me beat\nit.\u201d\nHolmes laughed. \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like that, Mr. Evans. There\nis no bolt-hole for you in this country. You shot\nthis man Prescott, did you not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, and got \ufb01ve years for it, though it was\nhe who pulled on me. Five years\u2014when I should\nhave had a medal the size of a soup plate. No\nliving man could tell a Prescott from a Bank of\nEngland, and if I hadn\u2019t put him out he would\nhave \ufb02ooded London with them. I was the only\none in the world who knew where he made them. Can you wonder that I wanted to get to the place? And can you wonder that when I found this crazy\nboob of a bug-hunter with the queer name squat-\nting right on the top of it, and never quitting his\nroom, I had to do the best I could to shift him? Maybe I would have been wiser if I had put him\naway. It would have been easy enough, but I\u2019m\na soft-hearted guy that can\u2019t begin shooting unless\nthe other man has a gun also. But say, Mr. Holmes,\nwhat have I done wrong, anyhow?"

It won\u2019t be entirely unexpected.\u201d\nSo those were the facts about Killer Evans and\nhis remarkable invention of the three Garridebs. We heard later that our poor old friend never got\nover the shock of his dissipated dreams. When his\n917\ncastle in the air fell down, it buried him beneath\nthe ruins.

It was a glad day at the Yard when\nthe Prescott out\ufb01t was discovered, for, though they\nknew that it existed, they had never been able, af-\nter the death of the man, to \ufb01nd out where it was. Evans had indeed done great service and caused\nseveral worthy C. I. D. men to sleep the sounder,\nfor the counterfeiter stands in a class by himself as\na public danger. They would willingly have sub-\nscribed to that soup-plate medal of which the crim-\ninal had spoken, but an unappreciative bench took\na less favourable view, and the Killer returned to\nthose shades from which he had just emerged. The Problem of Thor Bridge\nThe Problem of Thor Bridge\nS\nomewhere in the vaults of the bank of\nCox and Co., at Charing Cross, there is\na travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-\nbox with my name, John H. Watson,\nM.D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. It\nis crammed with papers, nearly all of which are\nrecords of cases to illustrate the curious problems\nwhich Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to\nexamine. Some, and not the least interesting, were\ncomplete failures, and as such will hardly bear\nnarrating, since no \ufb01nal explanation is forthcom-\ning. A problem without a solution may interest\nthe student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual\nreader. Among these un\ufb01nished tales is that of Mr.\nJames Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own\nhouse to get his umbrella, was never more seen in\nthis world. No less remarkable is that of the cut-\nter Alicia, which sailed one spring morning into a\nsmall patch of mist from where she never again\nemerged, nor was anything further ever heard of\nherself and her crew. A third case worthy of note\nis that of Isadora Persano, the well-known jour-\nnalist and duellist, who was found stark staring\nmad with a match box in front of him which con-\ntained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to\nscience. Apart from these unfathomed cases, there\nare some which involve the secrets of private fam-\nilies to an extent which would mean consternation\nin many exalted quarters if it were thought pos-\nsible that they might \ufb01nd their way into print. I\nneed not say that such a breach of con\ufb01dence is\nunthinkable, and that these records will be sepa-\nrated and destroyed now that my friend has time\nto turn his energies to the matter."

In some I was myself concerned\nand can speak as an eye-witness, while in others\nI was either not present or played so small a part\nthat they could only be told as by a third person. The following narrative is drawn from my own ex-\nperience. It was a wild morning in October, and I ob-\nserved as I was dressing how the last remaining\nleaves were being whirled from the solitary plane\ntree which graces the yard behind our house. I de-\nscended to breakfast prepared to \ufb01nd my compan-\nion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he\nwas easily impressed by his surroundings. On the\ncontrary, I found that he had nearly \ufb01nished his\nmeal, and that his mood was particularly bright\nand joyous, with that somewhat sinister cheerful-\nness which was characteristic of his lighter mo-\nments. \u201cYou have a case, Holmes?\u201d I remarked. \u201cThe faculty of deduction is certainly conta-\ngious, Watson,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt has enabled you\nto probe my secret. Yes, I have a case. After\na month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels\nmove once more.\u201d\n\u201cMight I share it?\u201d\n\u201cThere is little to share, but we may discuss\nit when you have consumed the two hard-boiled\neggs with which our new cook has favoured us. Their condition may not be unconnected with the\ncopy of the Family Herald which I observed yester-\nday upon the hall-table. Even so trivial a matter\nas cooking an egg demands an attention which is\nconscious of the passage of time and incompatible\nwith the love romance in that excellent periodical.\u201d\nA quarter of an hour later the table had been\ncleared and we were face to face. He had drawn a\nletter from his pocket. \u201cYou have heard of Neil Gibson, the Gold\nKing?\u201d he said. \u201cYou mean the American Senator?\u201d\n\u201cWell, he was once Senator for some Western\nstate, but is better known as the greatest gold-\nmining magnate in the world.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know of him. He has surely lived in\nEngland for some time. His name is very famil-\niar.\u201d\n\u201cYes, he bought a considerable estate in Hamp-\nshire some \ufb01ve years ago. Possibly you have al-\nready heard of the tragic end of his wife?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I remember it now. That is why the\nname is familiar. But I really know nothing of the\ndetails.\u201d\nHolmes waved his hand towards some papers\non a chair. \u201cI had no idea that the case was coming\nmy way or I should have had my extracts ready,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cThe fact is that the problem, though ex-\nceedingly sensational, appeared to present no dif-\n\ufb01culty.

Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:\nI can\u2019t see the best woman God ever\nmade go to her death without doing all\nthat is possible to save her. I can\u2019t ex-\nplain things\u2014I can\u2019t even try to explain\nthem, but I know beyond all doubt that\nMiss Dunbar is innocent. You know\nthe facts\u2014who doesn\u2019t?

That woman has a heart that wouldn\u2019t\nlet her kill a \ufb02y. Well, I\u2019ll come at eleven\nto-morrow and see if you can get some\nray of light in the dark. Maybe I have\na clue and don\u2019t know it. Anyhow, all\nI know and all I have and all I am are\nfor your use if only you can save her. If\never in your life you showed your pow-\ners, put them now into this case. Yours faithfully,\nJ. Neil Gibson. \u201cThere you have it,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes,\nknocking out the ashes of his after-breakfast pipe\nand slowly re\ufb01lling it. \u201cThat is the gentleman I\nawait. As to the story, you have hardly time to\nmaster all these papers, so I must give it to you in a\nnutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in\nthe proceedings. This man is the greatest \ufb01nancial\npower in the world, and a man, as I understand,\nof most violent and formidable character. He mar-\nried a wife, the victim of this tragedy, of whom I\nknow nothing save that she was past her prime,\nwhich was the more unfortunate as a very attrac-\ntive governess superintended the education of two\nyoung children. These are the three people con-\ncerned, and the scene is a grand old manor house,\nthe centre of a historical English state. Then as to\nthe tragedy. The wife was found in the grounds\nnearly half a mile from the house, late at night,\nclad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her\nshoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain. No weapon was found near her and there was\nno local clue as to the murder. No weapon near\nher, Watson\u2014mark that! The crime seems to have\nbeen committed late in the evening, and the body\nwas found by a game-keeper about eleven o\u2019clock,\nwhen it was examined by the police and by a doc-\ntor before being carried up to the house."

But why suspect the gov-\nerness?\u201d\n\u201cWell, in the \ufb01rst place there is some very direct\nevidence. A revolver with one discharged cham-\nber and a calibre which corresponded with the\nbullet was found on the \ufb02oor of her wardrobe.\u201d\nHis eyes \ufb01xed and he repeated in broken words,\n\u201cOn\u2014the\u2014\ufb02oor\u2014of\u2014her\u2014wardrobe.\u201d Then he\nsank into silence, and I saw that some train of\nthought had been set moving which I should be\nfoolish to interrupt.

Then the dead woman had a note upon\nher making an appointment at that very place and\nsigned by the governess. How\u2019s that? Finally there\nis the motive. Senator Gibson is an attractive per-\nson. If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed\nher than the young lady who had already by all\naccounts received pressing attentions from her em-\nployer?

Mr. Mar-\nlow Bates was a stranger to both of us. He was a\nthin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes\nand a twitching, hesitating manner\u2014a man whom\nmy own professional eye would judge to be on the\nbrink of an absolute nervous breakdown. \u201cYou seem agitated, Mr. Bates,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPray sit down.

Mr. Gibson is my\nemployer. I am manager of his estate. Mr. Holmes,\nhe is a villain\u2014an infernal villain.\u201d\n\u201cStrong language, Mr. Bates.\u201d\n\u201cI have to be emphatic, Mr. Holmes, for the\ntime is so limited. I would not have him \ufb01nd me\nhere for the world. He is almost due now. But I\nwas so situated that I could not come earlier.

When I considered the\npassionate, unconventional, unbusinesslike tone of\nhis letter and contrasted it with his self-contained\nmanner and appearance, it was pretty clear that\nthere was some deep emotion which centred upon\nthe accused woman rather than upon the victim. We\u2019ve got to understand the exact relations of\nthose three people if we are to reach the truth. You\nsaw the frontal attack which I made upon him, and\nhow imperturbably he received it. Then I bluffed\nhim by giving him the impression that I was abso-\nlutely certain, when in reality I was only extremely\nsuspicious.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he will come back?\u201d\n\u201cHe is sure to come back. He must come back. He can\u2019t leave it where it is. Ha! isn\u2019t that a ring? Yes, there is his footstep. Well, Mr. Gibson, I was\njust saying to Dr. Watson that you were somewhat\noverdue.\u201d\nThe Gold King had reentered the room in a\nmore chastened mood than he had left it. His\nwounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes,\nbut his common sense had shown him that he\nmust yield if he would attain his end. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I\nfeel that I have been hasty in taking your remarks\namiss. You are justi\ufb01ed in getting down to the\nfacts, whatever they may be, and I think the more\nof you for it. I can assure you, however, that the re-\nlations between Miss Dunbar and me don\u2019t really\ntouch this case.\u201d\n\u201cThat is for me to decide, is it not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I guess that is so. You\u2019re like a surgeon\nwho wants every symptom before he can give his\ndiagnosis.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. That expresses it. And it is only a\npatient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon\nwho would conceal the facts of his case.\u201d\n\u201cThat may be so, but you will admit, Mr.\nHolmes, that most men would shy off a bit when\nthey are asked point-blank what their relations\nwith a woman may be\u2014if there is really some se-\nrious feeling in the case."

But the object ex-\ncuses you, since it was to try and save her. Well,\nthe stakes are down and the reserve open, and you\ncan explore where you will. What is it you want?\u201d\n\u201cThe truth.\u201d\n924\nThe Problem of Thor Bridge\nThe Gold King paused for a moment as one\nwho marshals his thoughts. His grim, deep-lined\nface had become even sadder and more grave. \u201cI can give it to you in a very few words, Mr.\nHolmes,\u201d said he at last. \u201cThere are some things\nthat are painful as well as dif\ufb01cult to say, so I\nwon\u2019t go deeper than is needful. I met my wife\nwhen I was gold-hunting in Brazil. Maria Pinto\nwas the daughter of a government of\ufb01cial at Man-\naos, and she was very beautiful. I was young and\nardent in those days, but even now, as I look back\nwith colder blood and a more critical eye, I can\nsee that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty. It was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, whole-\nhearted, tropical, ill-balanced, very different from\nthe American women whom I had known. Well,\nto make a long story short, I loved her and I\nmarried her. It was only when the romance had\npassed\u2014and it lingered for years\u2014that I realized\nthat we had nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014in com-\nmon. My love faded. If hers had faded also it\nmight have been easier. But you know the won-\nderful way of women! Do what I might, nothing\ncould turn her from me. If I have been harsh to\nher, even brutal as some have said, it has been be-\ncause I knew that if I could kill her love, or if it\nturned to hate, it would be easier for both of us. But nothing changed her. She adored me in those\nEnglish woods as she had adored me twenty years\nago on the banks of the Amazon. Do what I might,\nshe was as devoted as ever. \u201cThen came Miss Grace Dunbar. She answered\nour advertisement and became governess to our\ntwo children. Perhaps you have seen her portrait\nin the papers. The whole world has proclaimed\nthat she also is a very beautiful woman. Now, I\nmake no pretence to be more moral than my neigh-\nbours, and I will admit to you that I could not live\nunder the same roof with such a woman and in\ndaily contact with her without feeling a passionate\nregard for her. Do you blame me, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cI do not blame you for feeling it. I should\nblame you if you expressed it, since this young\nlady was in a sense under your protection.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe so,\u201d said the millionaire, though\nfor a moment the reproof had brought the old an-\ngry gleam into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not pretending to\nbe any better than I am."

I told her\nso.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you did, did you?\u201d\nHolmes could look very formidable when he\nwas moved. \u201cI said to her that if I could marry her I would,\nbut that it was out of my power. I said that money\nwas no object and that all I could do to make her\nhappy and comfortable would be done.\u201d\n\u201cVery generous, I am sure,\u201d said Holmes with\na sneer. \u201cSee here, Mr. Holmes. I came to you on a\nquestion of evidence, not on a question of morals. I\u2019m not asking for your criticism.\u201d\n\u201cIt is only for the young lady\u2019s sake that I\ntouch your case at all,\u201d said Holmes sternly. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know that anything she is accused of is re-\nally worse than what you have yourself admitted,\nthat you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who\nwas under your roof. Some of you rich men have\nto be taught that all the world cannot be bribed\ninto condoning your offences.\u201d\nTo my surprise the Gold King took the reproof\nwith equanimity. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel myself about it now. I thank\nGod that my plans did not work out as I intended. She would have none of it, and she wanted to leave\nthe house instantly.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did she not?\u201d\n\u201cWell, in the \ufb01rst place, others were dependent\nupon her, and it was no light matter for her to let\nthem all down by sacri\ufb01cing her living. When I\nhad sworn\u2014as I did\u2014that she should never be\nmolested again, she consented to remain. But there\nwas another reason. She knew the in\ufb02uence she\nhad over me, and that it was stronger than any\nother in\ufb02uence in the world. She wanted to use it\nfor good.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cWell, she knew something of my affairs. They\nare large, Mr. Holmes\u2014large beyond the belief of\nan ordinary man. I can make or break\u2014and it is\nusually break. It wasn\u2019t individuals only. It was\ncommunities, cities, even nations. Business is a\nhard game, and the weak go to the wall. I played\nthe game for all it was worth. I never squealed my-\nself, and I never cared if the other fellow squealed. But she saw it different. I guess she was right. She\nbelieved and said that a fortune for one man that\nwas more than he needed should not be built on\nten thousand ruined men who were left without\nthe means of life. That was how she saw it, and I\nguess she could see past the dollars to something\nthat was more lasting. She found that I listened\n925\nThe Problem of Thor Bridge\nto what she said, and she believed she was serv-\ning the world by in\ufb02uencing my actions. So she\nstayed\u2014and then this came along.\u201d\n\u201cCan you throw any light upon that?\u201d\nThe Gold King paused for a minute or more,\nhis head sunk in his hands, lost in deep thought."

At \ufb01rst I was so\nrattled and taken aback that I was ready to think\nshe had been led away in some extraordinary fash-\nion that was clean against her usual nature. One\nexplanation came into my head. I give it to you,\nMr. Holmes, for what it is worth. There is no\ndoubt that my wife was bitterly jealous. There is\na soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-\njealousy, and though my wife had no cause\u2014and\nI think she understood this\u2014for the latter, she was\naware that this English girl exerted an in\ufb02uence\nupon my mind and my acts that she herself never\nhad. It was an in\ufb02uence for good, but that did\nnot mend the matter. She was crazy with hatred,\nand the heat of the Amazon was always in her\nblood. She might have planned to murder Miss\nDunbar\u2014or we will say to threaten her with a gun\nand so frighten her into leaving us. Then there\nmight have been a scuf\ufb02e and the gun gone off\nand shot the woman who held it.\u201d\n\u201cThat possibility had already occurred to me,\u201d\nsaid Holmes. \u201cIndeed, it is the only obvious alter-\nnative to deliberate murder.\u201d\n\u201cBut she utterly denies it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that is not \ufb01nal\u2014is it? One can under-\nstand that a woman placed in so awful a position\nmight hurry home still in her bewilderment hold-\ning the revolver. She might even throw it down\namong her clothes, hardly knowing what she was\ndoing, and when it was found she might try to lie\nher way out by a total denial, since all explanation\nwas impossible. What is against such a supposi-\ntion?\u201d\n\u201cMiss Dunbar herself.\u201d\n\u201cWell, perhaps.\u201d\nHolmes looked at his watch. \u201cI have no doubt\nwe can get the necessary permits this morning and\nreach Winchester by the evening train.

He did not accompany us himself,\nbut we had the address of Sergeant Coventry, of\nthe local police, who had \ufb01rst examined into the\naffair. He was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a\nsecretive and mysterious manner which conveyed\nthe idea that he knew or suspected a very great\ndeal more than he dared say. He had a trick, too,\nof suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if\nhe had come upon something of vital importance,\nthough the information was usually commonplace\nenough. Behind these tricks of manner he soon\nshowed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who\nwas not too proud to admit that he was out of his\ndepth and would welcome any help."

A walk\nof half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all\ngold and bronze with the fading ferns, brought us\n926\nThe Problem of Thor Bridge\nto a side-gate opening into the grounds of the Thor\nPlace estate. A path led us through the pheasant\npreserves, and then from a clearing we saw the\nwidespread, half-timbered house, half Tudor and\nhalf Georgian, upon the crest of the hill. Beside\nus there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the\ncentre where the main carriage drive passed over\na stone bridge, but swelling into small lakes on ei-\nther side. Our guide paused at the mouth of this\nbridge, and he pointed to the ground. \u201cThat was where Mrs. Gibson\u2019s body lay. I\nmarked it by that stone.\u201d\n\u201cI understand that you were there before it was\nmoved?\u201d\n\u201cYes, they sent for me at once.\u201d\n\u201cWho did?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Gibson himself. The moment the alarm\nwas given and he had rushed down with others\nfrom the house, he insisted that nothing should be\nmoved until the police should arrive.\u201d\n\u201cThat was sensible."

I expect\nit\u2019s been done by some passer-by.\u201d\nThe stonework was gray, but at this one point\nit showed white for a space not larger than a six-\npence. When examined closely one could see that\nthe surface was chipped as by a sharp blow. \u201cIt took some violence to do that,\u201d said Holmes\nthoughtfully. With his cane he struck the ledge\nseveral times without leaving a mark. \u201cYes, it was\na hard knock. In a curious place, too.

Give me all the help\nyou can, then, to get at the truth.\u201d\n\u201cI will conceal nothing.\u201d\n\u201cTell us, then, of your true relations with Mr.\nGibson\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\u201cShe hated me, Mr. Holmes. She hated me with\nall the fervour of her tropical nature. She was a\nwoman who would do nothing by halves, and the\nmeasure of her love for her husband was the mea-\nsure also of her hatred for me. It is probable that\nshe misunderstood our relations. I would not wish\nto wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical\nsense that she could hardly understand the mental,\nand even spiritual, tie which held her husband to\nme, or imagine that it was only my desire to in\ufb02u-\nence his power to good ends which kept me under\nhis roof. I can see now that I was wrong. Nothing\ncould justify me in remaining where I was a cause\nof unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the un-\nhappiness would have remained even if I had left\nthe house.\u201d\n\u201cNow, Miss Dunbar,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI beg you\nto tell us exactly what occurred that evening.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you the truth so far as I know\nit, Mr. Holmes, but I am in a position to prove\nnothing, and there are points\u2014the most vital\npoints\u2014which I can neither explain nor can I\nimagine any explanation.\u201d\n\u201cIf you will \ufb01nd the facts, perhaps others may\n\ufb01nd the explanation.\u201d\n\u201cWith regard, then, to my presence at Thor\nBridge that night, I received a note from Mrs. Gib-\nson in the morning. It lay on the table of the\nschoolroom, and it may have been left there by her\nown hand. It implored me to see her there after\ndinner, said she had something important to say\nto me, and asked me to leave an answer on the\nsundial in the garden, as she desired no one to be\nin our con\ufb01dence."

She was very much afraid of\nher husband, who treated her with a harshness for\nwhich I frequently reproached him, and I could\nonly imagine that she acted in this way because\nshe did not wish him to know of our interview.\u201d\n\u201cYet she kept your reply very carefully?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I was surprised to hear that she had it in\nher hand when she died.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what happened then?\u201d\n\u201cI went down as I had promised. When\nI reached the bridge she was waiting for me. Never did I realize till that moment how this\npoor creature hated me. She was like a mad\nwoman\u2014indeed, I think she was a mad woman,\nsubtly mad with the deep power of deception\nwhich insane people may have. How else could\nshe have met me with unconcern every day and yet\nhad so raging a hatred of me in her heart? I will\nnot say what she said. She poured her whole wild\nfury out in burning and horrible words. I did not\neven answer\u2014I could not. It was dreadful to see\nher. I put my hands to my ears and rushed away. When I left her she was standing, still shrieking\nout her curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge.\u201d\n\u201cWhere she was afterwards found?\u201d\n\u201cWithin a few yards from the spot.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet, presuming that she met her death\nshortly after you left her, you heard no shot?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I heard nothing. But, indeed, Mr. Holmes,\nI was so agitated and horri\ufb01ed by this terrible out-\nbreak that I rushed to get back to the peace of my\nown room, and I was incapable of noticing any-\nthing which happened.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that you returned to your room. Did\nyou leave it again before next morning?\u201d\n\u201cYes, when the alarm came that the poor crea-\nture had met her death I ran out with the others.\u201d\n\u201cDid you see Mr. Gibson?\u201d\n\u201cYes, he had just returned from the bridge\nwhen I saw him. He had sent for the doctor and\nthe police.\u201d\n929\nThe Problem of Thor Bridge\n\u201cDid he seem to you much perturbed?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Gibson is a very strong, self-contained\nman. I do not think that he would ever show his\nemotions on the surface. But I, who knew him so\nwell, could see that he was deeply concerned.\u201d\n\u201cThen we come to the all-important point. This\npistol that was found in your room. Had you ever\nseen it before?\u201d\n\u201cNever, I swear it.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was it found?\u201d\n\u201cNext morning, when the police made their\nsearch.\u201d\n\u201cAmong your clothes?\u201d\n\u201cYes, on the \ufb02oor of my wardrobe under my\ndresses.\u201d\n\u201cYou could not guess how long it had been\nthere?\u201d\n\u201cIt had not been there the morning before.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I tidied out the wardrobe.\u201d\n\u201cThat is \ufb01nal."

Only great\nviolence could have such an effect.\u201d\nHolmes did not answer. His pale, eager face\nhad suddenly assumed that tense, far-away ex-\npression which I had learned to associate with the\nsupreme manifestations of his genius. So evident\nwas the crisis in his mind that none of us dared\nto speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner, and my-\nself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed\nsilence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrat-\ning with nervous energy and the pressing need for\naction. \u201cCome, Watson, come!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat is it, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cNever mind, my dear lady.

You will get news by to-morrow, Miss\nDunbar, and meanwhile take my assurance that\nthe clouds are lifting and that I have every hope\nthat the light of truth is breaking through.\u201d\nIt was not a long journey from Winchester to\nThor Place, but it was long to me in my impatience,\nwhile for Holmes it was evident that it seemed\nendless; for, in his nervous restlessness, he could\nnot sit still, but paced the carriage or drummed\nwith his long, sensitive \ufb01ngers upon the cushions\nbeside him. Suddenly, however, as we neared our\ndestination he seated himself opposite to me\u2014we\nhad a \ufb01rst-class carriage to ourselves\u2014and laying\na hand upon each of my knees he looked into my\neyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which\nwas characteristic of his more imp-like moods. \u201cWatson,\u201d said he, \u201cI have some recollection\nthat you go armed upon these excursions of ours.\u201d\nIt was as well for him that I did so, for he took\nlittle care for his own safety when his mind was\nonce absorbed by a problem, so that more than\nonce my revolver had been a good friend in need. I reminded him of the fact. \u201cYes, yes, I am a little absent-minded in such\nmatters. But have you your revolver on you?\u201d\nI produced it from my hip-pocket, a short,\nhandy, but very serviceable little weapon."

There is a test\nbefore us. If the test comes off, all will be clear. And the test will depend upon the conduct of this\nlittle weapon. One cartridge out.

We\nsecured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an\nhour were at the house of our con\ufb01dential friend,\nthe sergeant. \u201cA clue, Mr. Holmes? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Wat-\nson\u2019s revolver,\u201d said my friend. \u201cHere it is. Now,\nof\ufb01cer, can you give me ten yards of string?\u201d\nThe village shop provided a ball of stout twine. \u201cI think that this is all we will need,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cNow, if you please, we will get off on\nwhat I hope is the last stage of our journey.\u201d\nThe sun was setting and turning the rolling\nHampshire moor into a wonderful autumnal\npanorama. The sergeant, with many critical\nand incredulous glances, which showed his deep\ndoubts of the sanity of my companion, lurched\nalong beside us. As we approached the scene of\nthe crime I could see that my friend under all his\nhabitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated. \u201cYes,\u201d he said in answer to my remark, \u201cyou\nhave seen me miss my mark before, Watson. I have\nan instinct for such things, and yet it has some-\ntimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when\n\ufb01rst it \ufb02ashed across my mind in the cell at Winch-\nester, but one drawback of an active mind is that\none can always conceive alternative explanations\nwhich would make our scent a false one. And\nyet\u2014and yet\u2014 Well, Watson, we can but try.\u201d\nAs he walked he had \ufb01rmly tied one end of\nthe string to the handle of the revolver. We had\nnow reached the scene of the tragedy. With great\ncare he marked out under the guidance of the po-\nliceman the exact spot where the body had been\nstretched. He then hunted among the heather and\nthe ferns until he found a considerable stone. This\nhe secured to the other end of his line of string,\nand he hung it over the parapet of the bridge\nso that it swung clear above the water. He then\nstood on the fatal spot, some distance from the\nedge of the bridge, with my revolver in his hand,\nthe string being taut between the weapon and the\nheavy stone on the farther side."

In an instant it had\nbeen whisked away by the weight of the stone, had\nstruck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and\nhad vanished over the side into the water. It had\nhardly gone before Holmes was kneeling beside\nthe stonework, and a joyous cry showed that he\nhad found what he expected. \u201cWas there ever a more exact demonstration?\u201d\nhe cried. \u201cSee, Watson, your revolver has solved\nthe problem!\u201d As he spoke he pointed to a sec-\nond chip of the exact size and shape of the \ufb01rst\nwhich had appeared on the under edge of the\nstone balustrade. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay at the inn to-night,\u201d he continued\nas he rose and faced the astonished sergeant. \u201cYou\nwill, of course, get a grappling-hook and you will\neasily restore my friend\u2019s revolver.

I have been sluggish in mind and\nwanting in that mixture of imagination and reality\nwhich is the basis of my art. I confess that the chip\nin the stonework was a suf\ufb01cient clue to suggest\nthe true solution, and that I blame myself for not\nhaving attained it sooner. \u201cIt must be admitted that the workings of this\nunhappy woman\u2019s mind were deep and subtle, so\nthat it was no very simple matter to unravel her\nplot. I do not think that in our adventures we have\never come across a stranger example of what per-\nverted love can bring about. Whether Miss Dunbar\nwas her rival in a physical or in a merely mental\nsense seems to have been equally unforgivable in\nher eyes. No doubt she blamed this innocent lady\nfor all those harsh dealings and unkind words with\nwhich her husband tried to repel her too demon-\nstrative affection. Her \ufb01rst resolution was to end\nher own life. Her second was to do it in such a\nway as to involve her victim in a fate which was\nworse far than any sudden death could be. \u201cWe can follow the various steps quite clearly,\nand they show a remarkable subtlety of mind. A\nnote was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar\nwhich would make it appear that she had chosen\nthe scene of the crime. In her anxiety that it should\nbe discovered she somewhat overdid it by holding\nit in her hand to the last."

Sherlock Holmes was always of\nopinion that I should publish the sin-\ngular facts connected with Professor\nPresbury, if only to dispel once for all\nthe ugly rumours which some twenty years ago\nagitated the university and were echoed in the\nlearned societies of London. There were, however,\ncertain obstacles in the way, and the true history\nof this curious case remained entombed in the tin\nbox which contains so many records of my friend\u2019s\nadventures. Now we have at last obtained permis-\nsion to ventilate the facts which formed one of the\nvery last cases handled by Holmes before his re-\ntirement from practice. Even now a certain reti-\ncence and discretion have to be observed in laying\nthe matter before the public. It was one Sunday evening early in September\nof the year 1903 that I received one of Holmes\u2019s\nlaconic messages:\nCome at once if convenient\u2014if incon-\nvenient come all the same. \u2014 S. H.\nThe relations between us in those latter days\nwere peculiar. He was a man of habits, narrow\nand concentrated habits, and I had become one of\nthem. As an institution I was like the violin, the\nshag tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books,\nand others perhaps less excusable. When it was\na case of active work and a comrade was needed\nupon whose nerve he could place some reliance,\nmy role was obvious. But apart from this I had\nuses. I was a whetstone for his mind.

If\nI irritated him by a certain methodical slowness in\nmy mentality, that irritation served only to make\nhis own \ufb02ame-like intuitions and impressions \ufb02ash\nup the more vividly and swiftly. Such was my\nhumble role in our alliance. When I arrived at Baker Street I found him\nhuddled up in his armchair with updrawn knees,\nhis pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with\nthought.

You may recollect that in the case\nwhich you, in your sensational way, coupled with\nthe Copper Beeches, I was able, by watching the\nmind of the child, to form a deduction as to the\ncriminal habits of the very smug and respectable\nfather.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I remember it well.\u201d\n\u201cMy line of thoughts about dogs is analogous.

And their pass-\ning moods may re\ufb02ect the passing moods of oth-\ners.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cSurely, Holmes, this is a\nlittle far-fetched,\u201d said I. He had re\ufb01lled his pipe and resumed his seat,\ntaking no notice of my comment. \u201cThe practical application of what I have said\nis very close to the problem which I am investi-\ngating.

One possible loose\nend lies in the question: Why does Professor Pres-\nbury\u2019s wolfhound, Roy, endeavour to bite him?\u201d\nI sank back in my chair in some disappoint-\nment.

I\nreally can hardly justify myself if I speak before\nany third person.\u201d\n\u201cHave no fear, Mr. Bennett.

Cer-\ntainly we must agree that the professor has every\nclaim upon his loyalty and devotion.

The\nprofessor, Watson, is a man of European reputa-\ntion. His life has been academic. There has never\nbeen a breath of scandal. He is a widower with\none daughter, Edith. He is, I gather, a man of very\nvirile and positive, one might almost say combat-\nive, character. So the matter stood until a very few\nmonths ago. \u201cThen the current of his life was broken. He is\nsixty-one years of age, but he became engaged to\nthe daughter of Professor Morphy, his colleague in\nthe chair of comparative anatomy. It was not, as\nI understand, the reasoned courting of an elderly\nman but rather the passionate frenzy of youth, for\nno one could have shown himself a more devoted\nlover."

None\nthe less, it did not meet with full approval in his\nown family.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought it rather excessive,\u201d said our visi-\ntor. \u201cExactly. Excessive and a little violent and un-\nnatural. Professor Presbury was rich, however, and\nthere was no objection upon the part of the father. The daughter, however, had other views, and there\nwere already several candidates for her hand, who,\nif they were less eligible from a worldly point of\nview, were at least more of an age. The girl seemed\nto like the professor in spite of his eccentricities. It\nwas only age which stood in the way. \u201cAbout this time a little mystery suddenly\nclouded the normal routine of the professor\u2019s life. He did what he had never done before. He left\nhome and gave no indication where he was go-\ning. He was away a fortnight and returned looking\nrather travel-worn. He made no allusion to where\nhe had been, although he was usually the frank-\nest of men. It chanced, however, that our client\nhere, Mr. Bennett, received a letter from a fellow-\nstudent in Prague, who said that he was glad to\nhave seen Professor Presbury there, although he\nhad not been able to talk to him. Only in this way\ndid his own household learn where he had been. \u201cNow comes the point. From that time onward\na curious change came over the professor. He be-\ncame furtive and sly. Those around him had al-\nways the feeling that he was not the man that they\nhad known, but that he was under some shadow\nwhich had darkened his higher qualities. His in-\ntellect was not affected. His lectures were as bril-\nliant as ever. But always there was something new,\nsomething sinister and unexpected. His daughter,\nwho was devoted to him, tried again and again\nto resume the old relations and to penetrate this\nmask which her father seemed to have put on. You, sir, as I understand, did the same\u2014but all\nwas in vain. And now, Mr. Bennett, tell in your\nown words the incident of the letters.\u201d\n\u201cYou must understand, Dr. Watson, that the\nprofessor had no secrets from me. If I were his\nson or his younger brother I could not have more\ncompletely enjoyed his con\ufb01dence. As his secre-\ntary I handled every paper which came to him,\nand I opened and subdivided his letters. Shortly\nafter his return all this was changed. He told me\n936\nThe Adventure of the Creeping Man\nthat certain letters might come to him from Lon-\ndon which would be marked by a cross under the\nstamp. These were to be set aside for his own\neyes only. I may say that several of these did\npass through my hands, that they had the E. C.\nmark, and were in an illiterate handwriting. If\nhe answered them at all the answers did not pass\nthrough my hands nor into the letter-basket in\nwhich our correspondence was collected.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the box,\u201d said Holmes."

It was the one\nthing which suggested a Continental tour, for it\nwas one of those quaint carved things which one\nassociates with Germany. This he placed in his\ninstrument cupboard. One day, in looking for a\ncanula, I took up the box. To my surprise he was\nvery angry, and reproved me in words which were\nquite savage for my curiosity. It was the \ufb01rst time\nsuch a thing had happened, and I was deeply hurt. I endeavoured to explain that it was a mere acci-\ndent that I had touched the box, but all the evening\nI was conscious that he looked at me harshly and\nthat the incident was rankling in his mind.\u201d Mr.\nBennett drew a little diary book from his pocket. \u201cThat was on July 2d,\u201d said he. \u201cYou are certainly an admirable witness,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cI may need some of these dates which\nyou have noted.\u201d\n\u201cI learned method among other things from\nmy great teacher. From the time that I observed\nabnormality in his behaviour I felt that it was my\nduty to study his case. Thus I have it here that it\nwas on that very day, July 2d, that Roy attacked the\nprofessor as he came from his study into the hall. Again, on July 11th, there was a scene of the same\nsort, and then I have a note of yet another upon\nJuly 20th. After that we had to banish Roy to the\nstables. He was a dear, affectionate animal\u2014but I\nfear I weary you.\u201d\nMr. Bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it\nwas very clear that Holmes was not listening. His\nface was rigid and his eyes gazed abstractedly at\nthe ceiling. With an effort he recovered himself. \u201cSingular! Most singular!\u201d he murmured. \u201cThese details were new to me, Mr. Bennett. I\nthink we have now fairly gone over the old ground,\nhave we not? But you spoke of some fresh devel-\nopments.\u201d\nThe pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded\nover,\nshadowed by some grim remembrance. \u201cWhat I speak of occurred the night before last,\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cI was lying awake about two in the morn-\ning, when I was aware of a dull muf\ufb02ed sound\ncoming from the passage. I opened my door and\npeeped out. I should explain that the professor\nsleeps at the end of the passage\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe date being\u2014?\u201d asked Holmes. Our visitor was clearly annoyed at so irrelevant\nan interruption. \u201cI have said, sir, that it was the night before\nlast\u2014that is, September 4th.\u201d\nHolmes nodded and smiled. \u201cPray continue,\u201d said he. \u201cHe sleeps at the end of the passage and\nwould have to pass my door in order to reach\nthe staircase. It was a really terrifying experience,\nMr. Holmes. I think that I am as strong-nerved\nas my neighbours, but I was shaken by what I\nsaw. The passage was dark save that one window\nhalfway along it threw a patch of light."

He\nwas crawling, Mr. Holmes\u2014crawling! He was not\nquite on his hands and knees. I should rather say\non his hands and feet, with his face sunk between\nhis hands. Yet he seemed to move with ease. I was\nso paralyzed by the sight that it was not until he\nhad reached my door that I was able to step for-\nward and ask if I could assist him. His answer was\nextraordinary. He sprang up, spat out some atro-\ncious word at me, and hurried on past me, and\ndown the staircase. I waited about for an hour, but\nhe did not come back. It must have been daylight\nbefore he regained his room.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Watson, what make you of that?\u201d asked\nHolmes with the air of the pathologist who\npresents a rare specimen. \u201cLumbago, possibly. I have known a severe at-\ntack make a man walk in just such a way, and noth-\ning would be more trying to the temper.\u201d\n\u201cGood, Watson! You always keep us \ufb02at-footed\non the ground. But we can hardly accept lumbago,\nsince he was able to stand erect in a moment.\u201d\n\u201cHe was never better in health,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cIn fact, he is stronger than I have known him for\nyears. But there are the facts, Mr. Holmes. It is not\na case in which we can consult the police, and yet\nwe are utterly at our wit\u2019s end as to what to do,\nand we feel in some strange way that we are drift-\ning towards disaster. Edith\u2014Miss Presbury\u2014feels\nas I do, that we cannot wait passively any longer.\u201d\n\u201cIt is certainly a very curious and suggestive\ncase. What do you think, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking as a medical man,\u201d said I, \u201cit ap-\npears to be a case for an alienist. The old gen-\ntleman\u2019s cerebral processes were disturbed by the\n937\nThe Adventure of the Creeping Man\nlove affair. He made a journey abroad in the hope\nof breaking himself of the passion. His letters and\nthe box may be connected with some other private\ntransaction\u2014a loan, perhaps, or share certi\ufb01cates,\nwhich are in the box.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the wolfhound no doubt disapproved of\nthe \ufb01nancial bargain. No, no, Watson, there is\nmore in it than this. Now, I can only suggest\u2014\u201d\nWhat Sherlock Holmes was about to suggest\nwill never be known, for at this moment the door\nopened and a young lady was shown into the\nroom. As she appeared Mr. Bennett sprang up\nwith a cry and ran forward with his hands out to\nmeet those which she had herself outstretched. \u201cEdith, dear! Nothing the matter, I hope?\u201d\n\u201cI felt I must follow you. Oh, Jack, I have been\nso dreadfully frightened! It is awful to be there\nalone.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Holmes, this is the young lady I spoke of. This is my \ufb01ancee.\u201d\n\u201cWe were gradually coming to that conclusion,\nwere we not, Watson?\u201d Holmes answered with\na smile."

Of\ncourse, he had told me that he would consult you. But, oh, Mr. Holmes, can you do nothing for my\npoor father?\u201d\n\u201cI have hopes, Miss Presbury, but the case is\nstill obscure. Perhaps what you have to say may\nthrow some fresh light upon it.\u201d\n\u201cIt was last night, Mr. Holmes. He had been\nvery strange all day. I am sure that there are times\nwhen he has no recollection of what he does. He\nlives as in a strange dream. Yesterday was such a\nday. It was not my father with whom I lived. His\noutward shell was there, but it was not really he.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d\n\u201cI was awakened in the night by the dog bark-\ning most furiously. Poor Roy, he is chained now\nnear the stable. I may say that I always sleep with\nmy door locked; for, as Jack\u2014as Mr. Bennett\u2014will\ntell you, we all have a feeling of impending danger. My room is on the second \ufb02oor. It happened that\nthe blind was up in my window, and there was\nbright moonlight outside. As I lay with my eyes\n\ufb01xed upon the square of light, listening to the fren-\nzied barkings of the dog, I was amazed to see my\nfather\u2019s face looking in at me. Mr. Holmes, I nearly\ndied of surprise and horror. There it was pressed\nagainst the window-pane, and one hand seemed to\nbe raised as if to push up the window. If that win-\ndow had opened, I think I should have gone mad. It was no delusion, Mr. Holmes. Don\u2019t deceive\nyourself by thinking so. I dare say it was twenty\nseconds or so that I lay paralyzed and watched the\nface. Then it vanished, but I could not\u2014I could\nnot spring out of bed and look out after it. I lay\ncold and shivering till morning. At breakfast he\nwas sharp and \ufb01erce in manner, and made no al-\nlusion to the adventure of the night. Neither did\nI, but I gave an excuse for coming to town\u2014and\nhere I am.\u201d\nHolmes looked thoroughly surprised at Miss\nPresbury\u2019s narrative. \u201cMy dear young lady, you say that your room\nis on the second \ufb02oor. Is there a long ladder in the\ngarden?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mr. Holmes, that is the amazing part of\nit. There is no possible way of reaching the win-\ndow\u2014and yet he was there.\u201d\n\u201cThe date being September 5th,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThat certainly complicates matters.\u201d\nIt was the young lady\u2019s turn to look surprised. \u201cThis is the second time that you have alluded to\nthe date, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cIs it possible\nthat it has any bearing upon the case?\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible\u2014very possible\u2014and yet I have\nnot my full material at present.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly you are thinking of the connection\nbetween insanity and phases of the moon?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I assure you."

A friendly native will surely guide us.\u201d\nSuch a one on the back of a smart hansom\nswept us past a row of ancient colleges and, \ufb01nally\nturning into a tree-lined drive, pulled up at the\ndoor of a charming house, girt round with lawns\nand covered with purple wisteria. Professor Pres-\nbury was certainly surrounded with every sign not\nonly of comfort but of luxury. Even as we pulled\nup, a grizzled head appeared at the front window,\nand we were aware of a pair of keen eyes from\nunder shaggy brows which surveyed us through\nlarge horn glasses.

Thus the last outbreak\nupon Friday was on September 3d, which also falls\ninto the series, as did August 26th, which preceded\nit. The thing is beyond coincidence.\u201d\nI was forced to agree. \u201cLet us, then, form the provisional theory that\nevery nine days the professor takes some strong\ndrug which has a passing but highly poisonous\neffect. His naturally violent nature is intensi\ufb01ed\nby it. He learned to take this drug while he was in\nPrague, and is now supplied with it by a Bohemian\nintermediary in London. This all hangs together,\nWatson!\u201d\n\u201cBut the dog, the face at the window, the creep-\ning man in the passage?\u201d\n\u201cWell, well, we have made a beginning."

It was a \ufb01ne night, but\nchilly, and we were glad of our warm overcoats. There was a breeze, and clouds were scudding\nacross the sky, obscuring from time to time the\nhalf-moon. It would have been a dismal vigil were\nit not for the expectation and excitement which\ncarried us along, and the assurance of my com-\nrade that we had probably reached the end of the\nstrange sequence of events which had engaged our\nattention. \u201cIf the cycle of nine days holds good then we\nshall have the professor at his worst to-night,\u201d said\nHolmes. \u201cThe fact that these strange symptoms\n941\nThe Adventure of the Creeping Man\nbegan after his visit to Prague, that he is in se-\ncret correspondence with a Bohemian dealer in\nLondon, who presumably represents someone in\nPrague, and that he received a packet from him\nthis very day, all point in one direction. What he\ntakes and why he takes it are still beyond our ken,\nbut that it emanates in some way from Prague is\nclear enough. He takes it under de\ufb01nite directions\nwhich regulate this ninth-day system, which was\nthe \ufb01rst point which attracted my attention. But\nhis symptoms are most remarkable. Did you ob-\nserve his knuckles?\u201d\nI had to confess that I did not. \u201cThick and horny in a way which is quite new\nin my experience. Always look at the hands \ufb01rst,\nWatson. Then cuffs, trouser-knees, and boots. Very\ncurious knuckles which can only be explained by\nthe mode of progression observed by\u2014\u201d Holmes\npaused and suddenly clapped his hand to his fore-\nhead. \u201cOh, Watson, Watson, what a fool I have\nbeen! It seems incredible, and yet it must be true. All points in one direction. How could I miss see-\ning the connection of ideas? Those knuckles\u2014how\ncould I have passed those knuckles? And the dog! And the ivy! It\u2019s surely time that I disappeared\ninto that little farm of my dreams. Look out, Wat-\nson! Here he is! We shall have the chance of seeing\nfor ourselves.\u201d\nThe hall door had slowly opened, and against\nthe lamplit background we saw the tall \ufb01gure of\nProfessor Presbury. He was clad in his dressing-\ngown. As he stood outlined in the doorway he was\nerect but leaning forward with dangling arms, as\nwhen we saw him last. Now he stepped forward into the drive, and\nan extraordinary change came over him. He sank\ndown into a crouching position and moved along\nupon his hands and feet, skipping every now and\nthen as if he were over\ufb02owing with energy and vi-\ntality. He moved along the face of the house and\nthen round the corner. As he disappeared Bennett\nslipped through the hall door and softly followed\nhim. \u201cCome, Watson, come!\u201d cried Holmes, and we\nstole as softly as we could through the bushes un-\ntil we had gained a spot whence we could see\nthe other side of the house, which was bathed\nin the light of the half-moon."

From\nbranch to branch he sprang, sure of foot and \ufb01rm\nof grasp, climbing apparently in mere joy at his\nown powers, with no de\ufb01nite object in view. With\nhis dressing-gown \ufb02apping on each side of him, he\nlooked like some huge bat glued against the side\nof his own house, a great square dark patch upon\nthe moonlit wall. Presently he tired of this amuse-\nment, and, dropping from branch to branch, he\nsquatted down into the old attitude and moved\ntowards the stables, creeping along in the same\nstrange way as before. The wolfhound was out\nnow, barking furiously, and more excited than ever\nwhen it actually caught sight of its master. It was\nstraining on its chain and quivering with eagerness\nand rage. The professor squatted down very delib-\nerately just out of reach of the hound and began to\nprovoke it in every possible way. He took hand-\nfuls of pebbles from the drive and threw them in\nthe dog\u2019s face, prodded him with a stick which he\nhad picked up, \ufb02icked his hands about only a few\ninches from the gaping mouth, and endeavoured\nin every way to increase the animal\u2019s fury, which\nwas already beyond all control. In all our adven-\ntures I do not know that I have ever seen a more\nstrange sight than this impassive and still digni\ufb01ed\n\ufb01gure crouching frog-like upon the ground and\ngoading to a wilder exhibition of passion the mad-\ndened hound, which ramped and raged in front\nof him, by all manner of ingenious and calculated\ncruelty. And then in a moment it happened! It was\nnot the chain that broke, but it was the collar\nthat slipped, for it had been made for a thick-\nnecked Newfoundland. We heard the rattle of\nfalling metal, and the next instant dog and man\nwere rolling on the ground together, the one roar-\ning in rage, the other screaming in a strange shrill\nfalsetto of terror. It was a very narrow thing for\nthe professor\u2019s life. The savage creature had him\nfairly by the throat, its fangs had bitten deep, and\nhe was senseless before we could reach them and\ndrag the two apart. It might have been a danger-\nous task for us, but Bennett\u2019s voice and presence\nbrought the great wolfhound instantly to reason. The uproar had brought the sleepy and astonished\ncoachman from his room above the stables. \u201cI\u2019m\nnot surprised,\u201d said he, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve\nseen him at it before. I knew the dog would get\nhim sooner or later.\u201d\nThe hound was secured, and together we car-\nried the professor up to his room, where Bennett,\nwho had a medical degree, helped me to dress his\ntorn throat. The sharp teeth had passed danger-\nously near the carotid artery, and the haemorrhage\nwas serious. In half an hour the danger was past, I\nhad given the patient an injection of morphia, and\nhe had sunk into deep sleep."

Honoured Colleague [it ran]:\nSince your esteemed visit I have\nthought much of your case, and though\nin your circumstances there are some\nspecial reasons for the treatment, I\nwould none the less enjoin caution, as\nmy results have shown that it is not\nwithout danger of a kind. It is possible that the serum of anthro-\npoid would have been better. I have,\nas I explained to you, used black-faced\nlangur because a specimen was accessi-\nble. Langur is, of course, a crawler and\nclimber, while anthropoid walks erect\nand is in all ways nearer. I beg you to take every possible pre-\ncaution that there be no premature rev-\nelation of the process. I have one other\nclient in England, and Dorak is my\nagent for both. Weekly reports will oblige. Yours with high esteem,\nH. Lowenstein. Lowenstein! The name brought back to me\nthe memory of some snippet from a newspaper\nwhich spoke of an obscure scientist who was striv-\ning in some unknown way for the secret of reju-\nvenescence and the elixir of life. Lowenstein of\nPrague! Lowenstein with the wondrous strength-\ngiving serum, tabooed by the profession because\nhe refused to reveal its source. In a few words\nI said what I remembered. Bennett had taken a\nmanual of zoology from the shelves. \u201c \u2018Langur,\u2019 \u201d\nhe read, \u201c \u2018the great black-faced monkey of the Hi-\nmalayan slopes, biggest and most human of climb-\ning monkeys.\u2019\nMany details are added. Well,\nthanks to you, Mr. Holmes, it is very clear that we\nhave traced the evil to its source.\u201d\n\u201cThe real source,\u201d said Holmes, \u201clies, of course,\nin that untimely love affair which gave our im-\npetuous professor the idea that he could only gain\nhis wish by turning himself into a younger man."

It occurred after my\nwithdrawal to my little Sussex home, when I had\ngiven myself up entirely to that soothing life of Na-\nture for which I had so often yearned during the\nlong years spent amid the gloom of London. At\nthis period of my life the good Watson had passed\nalmost beyond my ken. An occasional week-end\nvisit was the most that I ever saw of him. Thus I\nmust act as my own chronicler. Ah! had he but\nbeen with me, how much he might have made of\nso wonderful a happening and of my eventual tri-\numph against every dif\ufb01culty! As it is, however,\nI must needs tell my tale in my own plain way,\nshowing by my words each step upon the dif\ufb01-\ncult road which lay before me as I searched for the\nmystery of the Lion\u2019s Mane. My villa is situated upon the southern slope of\nthe downs, commanding a great view of the Chan-\nnel. At this point the coast-line is entirely of chalk\ncliffs, which can only be descended by a single,\nlong, tortuous path, which is steep and slippery."

Here and there, however, there are curves and hol-\nlows which make splendid swimming-pools \ufb01lled\nafresh with each \ufb02ow. This admirable beach ex-\ntends for some miles in each direction, save only\nat one point where the little cove and village of\nFulworth break the line. My house is lonely. I, my old housekeeper,\nand my bees have the estate all to ourselves. Half\na mile off, however, is Harold Stackhurst\u2019s well-\nknown coaching establishment, The Gables, quite\na large place, which contains some score of young\nfellows preparing for various professions, with a\nstaff of several masters. Stackhurst himself was\na well-known rowing Blue in his day, and an ex-\ncellent all-round scholar. He and I were always\nfriendly from the day I came to the coast, and he\nwas the one man who was on such terms with me\nthat we could drop in on each other in the evenings\nwithout an invitation. Towards the end of July, 1907, there was a se-\nvere gale, the wind blowing up-channel, heaping\nthe seas to the base of the cliffs and leaving a la-\ngoon at the turn of the tide. On the morning of\nwhich I speak the wind had abated, and all Nature\nwas newly washed and fresh. It was impossible to\nwork upon so delightful a day, and I strolled out\nbefore breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air. I walked\nalong the cliff path which led to the steep descent\nto the beach. As I walked I heard a shout behind\nme, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his\nhand in cheery greeting. \u201cWhat a morning, Mr. Holmes! I thought I\nshould see you out.\u201d\n\u201cGoing for a swim, I see.\u201d\n\u201cAt your old tricks again,\u201d he laughed, patting\nhis bulging pocket. \u201cYes. McPherson started early,\nand I expect I may \ufb01nd him there.\u201d\nFitzroy McPherson was the science master,\na \ufb01ne upstanding young fellow whose life had\nbeen crippled by heart trouble following rheumatic\nfever. He was a natural athlete, however, and ex-\ncelled in every game which did not throw too great\na strain upon him. Summer and winter he went for\nhis swim, and, as I am a swimmer myself, I have\noften joined him. At this moment we saw the man himself. His\nhead showed above the edge of the cliff where the\npath ends. Then his whole \ufb01gure appeared at the\ntop, staggering like a drunken man. The next in-\nstant he threw up his hands and, with a terrible\ncry, fell upon his face. Stackhurst and I rushed for-\nward\u2014it may have been \ufb01fty yards\u2014and turned\nhim on his back. He was obviously dying. Those\nglazed sunken eyes and dreadful livid cheeks\ncould mean nothing else. One glimmer of life\ncame into his face for an instant, and he uttered\ntwo or three words with an eager air of warning."

Then he half raised himself\nfrom the ground, threw his arms into the air, and\nfell forward on his side. He was dead. My companion was paralyzed by the sudden\nhorror of it, but I, as may well be imagined, had\nevery sense on the alert. And I had need, for it\nwas speedily evident that we were in the presence\nof an extraordinary case. The man was dressed\nonly in his Burberry overcoat, his trousers, and an\nunlaced pair of canvas shoes. As he fell over, his\nBurberry, which had been simply thrown round\nhis shoulders, slipped off, exposing his trunk. We\nstared at it in amazement. His back was cov-\nered with dark red lines as though he had been\nterribly \ufb02ogged by a thin wire scourge.

Murdoch was\nthe mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall,\ndark, thin man, so taciturn and aloof that none can\nbe said to have been his friend. He seemed to live\nin some high, abstract region of surds and conic\nsections, with little to connect him with ordinary\nlife. He was looked upon as an oddity by the stu-\ndents, and would have been their butt, but there\nwas some strange outlandish blood in the man,\nwhich showed itself not only in his coal-black eyes\nand swarthy face but also in occasional outbreaks\nof temper, which could only be described as fero-\ncious. On one occasion, being plagued by a little\ndog belonging to McPherson, he had caught the\ncreature up and hurled it through the plate-glass\nwindow, an action for which Stackhurst would cer-\ntainly have given him his dismissal had he not\nbeen a very valuable teacher. Such was the strange\ncomplex man who now appeared beside us. He\nseemed to be honestly shocked at the sight before\nhim, though the incident of the dog may show that\nthere was no great sympathy between the dead\nman and himself. \u201cPoor fellow! Poor fellow! What can I do? How can I help?\u201d\n\u201cWere you with him? Can you tell us what has\nhappened?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I was late this morning. I was not on\nthe beach at all.

My \ufb01rst task naturally was to note who was on the\nbeach. From the top of the path I could see the\nwhole sweep of it, and it was absolutely deserted\nsave that two or three dark \ufb01gures could be seen\nfar away moving towards the village of Fulworth. Having satis\ufb01ed myself upon this point, I walked\nslowly down the path. There was clay or soft marl\nmixed with the chalk, and every here and there\nI saw the same footstep, both ascending and de-\nscending. No one else had gone down to the beach\nby this track that morning. At one place I ob-\nserved the print of an open hand with the \ufb01ngers\ntowards the incline. This could only mean that\npoor McPherson had fallen as he ascended. There\nwere rounded depressions, too, which suggested\nthat he had come down upon his knees more than\nonce. At the bottom of the path was the consider-\nable lagoon left by the retreating tide. At the side\nof it McPherson had undressed, for there lay his\ntowel on a rock. It was folded and dry, so that it\nwould seem that, after all, he had never entered\nthe water. Once or twice as I hunted round amid\nthe hard shingle I came on little patches of sand\nwhere the print of his canvas shoe, and also of his\nnaked foot, could be seen. The latter fact proved\nthat he had made all ready to bathe, though the\ntowel indicated that he had not actually done so. And here was the problem clearly de\ufb01ned\u2014as\nstrange a one as had ever confronted me. The\nman had not been on the beach more than a quar-\nter of an hour at the most. Stackhurst had fol-\nlowed him from The Gables, so there could be no\ndoubt about that. He had gone to bathe and had\nstripped, as the naked footsteps showed. Then he\nhad suddenly huddled on his clothes again\u2014they\nwere all dishevelled and unfastened\u2014and he had\nreturned without bathing, or at any rate without\ndrying himself. And the reason for his change\nof purpose had been that he had been scourged\nin some savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until\nhe bit his lip through in his agony, and was left\nwith only strength enough to crawl away and to\ndie. Who had done this barbarous deed? There\nwere, it is true, small grottos and caves in the base\nof the cliffs, but the low sun shone directly into\nthem, and there was no place for concealment. Then, again, there were those distant \ufb01gures on\nthe beach. They seemed too far away to have been\nconnected with the crime, and the broad lagoon\nin which McPherson had intended to bathe lay be-\ntween him and them, lapping up to the rocks."

In the meantime\nI searched the dead man\u2019s pockets. There were\nhis handkerchief, a large knife, and a small fold-\ning card-case. From this projected a slip of pa-\nper, which I unfolded and handed to the constable. There was written on it in a scrawling, feminine\nhand:\nI will be there, you may be sure. Maudie. It read like a love affair, an assignation, though\nwhen and where were a blank. The constable re-\nplaced it in the card-case and returned it with the\nother things to the pockets of the Burberry. Then,\nas nothing more suggested itself, I walked back\nto my house for breakfast, having \ufb01rst arranged\nthat the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly\nsearched. Stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell\nme that the body had been removed to The Gables,\nwhere the inquest would be held. He brought\nwith him some serious and de\ufb01nite news. As I ex-\npected, nothing had been found in the small caves\nbelow the cliff, but he had examined the papers in\nMcPherson\u2019s desk, and there were several which\nshowed an intimate correspondence with a certain\nMiss Maud Bellamy, of Fulworth. We had then es-\ntablished the identity of the writer of the note. \u201cThe police have the letters,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\ncould not bring them.

The one thing that impressed itself forcibly\nupon my mind was that Mr. Ian Murdoch was\ntaking the \ufb01rst chance to open a path of escape\nfrom the scene of the crime. Suspicion, vague and\nnebulous, was now beginning to take outline in\nmy mind. Perhaps the visit to the Bellamys might\nthrow some further light upon the matter.

His record must be examined. His rooms must\nbe privately searched. Stackhurst was a willing\ncollaborator, for in his mind also suspicions were\nforming. We returned from our visit to The Haven\nwith the hope that one free end of this tangled\nskein was already in our hands. A week passed. The inquest had thrown no\nlight upon the matter and had been adjourned for\nfurther evidence. Stackhurst had made discreet in-\nquiry about his subordinate, and there had been\na super\ufb01cial search of his room, but without re-\nsult. Personally, I had gone over the whole ground\nagain, both physically and mentally, but with no\nnew conclusions. In all my chronicles the reader\nwill \ufb01nd no case which brought me so completely\nto the limit of my powers. Even my imagination\ncould conceive no solution to the mystery. And\nthen there came the incident of the dog. It was my old housekeeper who heard of it \ufb01rst\nby that strange wireless by which such people col-\nlect the news of the countryside. \u201cSad story this, sir, about Mr. McPherson\u2019s\ndog,\u201d said she one evening.

Died of grief for its master.\u201d\n\u201cWho told you this?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, sir, everyone is talking of it. It took on\nterrible, and has eaten nothing for a week. Then to-\nday two of the young gentlemen from The Gables\nfound it dead\u2014down on the beach, sir, at the very\nplace where its master met his end.\u201d\n\u201cAt the very place.\u201d The words stood out clear\nin my memory. Some dim perception that the mat-\nter was vital rose in my mind. That the dog should\ndie was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs. But \u201cin the very place\u201d! Why should this lonely\nbeach be fatal to it? Was it possible that it also had\nbeen sacri\ufb01ced to some revengeful feud? Was it\npossible\u2014? Yes, the perception was dim, but al-\nready something was building up in my mind. In\na few minutes I was on my way to The Gables,\nwhere I found Stackhurst in his study. At my re-\nquest he sent for Sudbury and Blount, the two stu-\ndents who had found the dog. \u201cYes, it lay on the very edge of the pool,\u201d said\none of them. \u201cIt must have followed the trail of its\ndead master.\u201d\nI saw the faithful little creature, an Airedale ter-\nrier, laid out upon the mat in the hall. The body\nwas stiff and rigid, the eyes projecting, and the\nlimbs contorted. There was agony in every line\nof it. From The Gables I walked down to the\nbathing-pool. The sun had sunk and the shadow\nof the great cliff lay black across the water, which\nglimmered dully like a sheet of lead."

I had known that\nthere was something which might bear upon this\nmatter. It was still vague, but at least I knew how\nI could make it clear. It was monstrous, incredible,\nand yet it was always a possibility. I would test it\nto the full. There is a great garret in my little house which\nis stuffed with books. It was into this that I\nplunged and rummaged for an hour. At the end\nof that time I emerged with a little chocolate and\nsilver volume. Eagerly I turned up the chapter of\nwhich I had a dim remembrance. Yes, it was in-\ndeed a far-fetched and unlikely proposition, and\nyet I could not be at rest until I had made sure if\nit might, indeed, be so. It was late when I retired,\nwith my mind eagerly awaiting the work of the\nmorrow. But that work met with an annoying interrup-\ntion. I had hardly swallowed my early cup of\ntea and was starting for the beach when I had a\ncall from Inspector Bardle of the Sussex Constabu-\nlary\u2014a steady, solid, bovine man with thoughtful\neyes, which looked at me now with a very troubled\nexpression. \u201cI know your immense experience, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cThis is quite unof\ufb01cial, of course, and need go no\nfarther. But I am fairly up against it in this McPher-\nson case. The question is, shall I make an arrest,\nor shall I not?\u201d\n\u201cMeaning Mr. Ian Murdoch?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.

There, crisscrossed upon the man\u2019s naked shoul-\nder, was the same strange reticulated pattern of\nred, in\ufb02amed lines which had been the death-mark\nof Fitzroy McPherson. The pain was evidently terrible and was more\nthan local, for the sufferer\u2019s breathing would stop\nfor a time, his face would turn black, and then with\nloud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart,\nwhile his brow dropped beads of sweat. At any\nmoment he might die. More and more brandy was\npoured down his throat, each fresh dose bring-\ning him back to life. Pads of cotton-wool soaked\nin salad-oil seemed to take the agony from the\nstrange wounds. At last his head fell heavily upon\nthe cushion. Exhausted Nature had taken refuge\nin its last storehouse of vitality. It was half a sleep\nand half a faint, but at least it was ease from pain.

Come back to my house, both of you, and I will\ngive you the terrible experience of one who has\ngood reason to remember his own meeting with\nthe same peril of the seas.\u201d\nWhen we reached my study we found that\nMurdoch was so far recovered that he could sit\nup. He was dazed in mind, and every now and\nthen was shaken by a paroxysm of pain. In broken\nwords he explained that he had no notion what\nhad occurred to him, save that terri\ufb01c pangs had\nsuddenly shot through him, and that it had taken\nall his fortitude to reach the bank. \u201cHere is a book,\u201d I said, taking up the little vol-\nume, \u201cwhich \ufb01rst brought light into what might\nhave been forever dark. It is Out of Doors, by\nthe famous observer, J. G. Wood. Wood himself\nvery nearly perished from contact with this vile\ncreature, so he wrote with a very full knowledge. Cyanea capillata is the miscreant\u2019s full name, and he\ncan be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful\nthan, the bite of the cobra. Let me brie\ufb02y give this\nextract. \u201cIf the bather should see a loose roundish\nmass of tawny membranes and \ufb01bres, some-\nthing like very large handfuls of lion\u2019s mane\nand silver paper, let him beware, for this is\nthe fearful stinger, Cyanea capillata. Could our sinister acquaintance be more clearly\ndescribed? \u201cHe goes on to tell of his own encounter with\none when swimming off the coast of Kent. He\nfound that the creature radiated almost invisible\n\ufb01laments to the distance of \ufb01fty feet, and that\nanyone within that circumference from the deadly\ncentre was in danger of death. Even at a distance\nthe effect upon Wood was almost fatal. \u201cThe multitudinous threads caused light\nscarlet lines upon the skin which on closer\nexamination resolved into minute dots or\npustules, each dot charged as it were with a\nred-hot needle making its way through the\nnerves. \u201cThe local pain was, as he explains, the least part\nof the exquisite torment. \u201cPangs shot through the chest, causing me\nto fall as if struck by a bullet. The pulsa-\ntion would cease, and then the heart would\ngive six or seven leaps as if it would force\nits way through the chest. \u201cIt nearly killed him, although he had only been\nexposed to it in the disturbed ocean and not in\nthe narrow calm waters of a bathing-pool. He says\nthat he could hardly recognize himself afterwards,\nso white, wrinkled and shrivelled was his face. He gulped down brandy, a whole bottleful, and it\nseems to have saved his life. There is the book, In-\nspector. I leave it with you, and you cannot doubt\nthat it contains a full explanation of the tragedy of\npoor McPherson.\u201d\n\u201cAnd incidentally exonerates me,\u201d remarked\nIan Murdoch with a wry smile."

I feel that on the very eve\nof my arrest I have only cleared myself by sharing\nthe fate of my poor friend.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mr. Murdoch. I was already upon the\ntrack, and had I been out as early as I intended\nI might well have saved you from this terri\ufb01c ex-\nperience.\u201d\n\u201cBut how did you know, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cI am an omnivorous reader with a strangely\nretentive memory for tri\ufb02es. That phrase \u2018the\nLion\u2019s Mane\u2019 haunted my mind. I knew that I had\nseen it somewhere in an unexpected context. You\nhave seen that it does describe the creature. I have\nno doubt that it was \ufb02oating on the water when\n954\nMcPherson saw it, and that this phrase was the\nonly one by which he could convey to us a warn-\ning as to the creature which had been his death.\u201d\n\u201cThen I, at least, am cleared,\u201d said Murdoch,\nrising slowly to his feet. \u201cThere are one or two\nwords of explanation which I should give, for I\nknow the direction in which your inquiries have\nrun. It is true that I loved this lady, but from the\nday when she chose my friend McPherson my one\ndesire was to help her to happiness. I was well\ncontent to stand aside and act as their go-between. Often I carried their messages, and it was because\nI was in their con\ufb01dence and because she was so\ndear to me that I hastened to tell her of my friend\u2019s\ndeath, lest someone should forestall me in a more\nsudden and heartless manner. She would not tell\nyou, sir, of our relations lest you should disap-\nprove and I might suffer. But with your leave I\nmust try to get back to The Gables, for my bed\nwill be very welcome.\u201d\nStackhurst held out his hand. \u201cOur nerves have\nall been at concert-pitch,\u201d said he. \u201cForgive what\nis past, Murdoch. We shall understand each other\nbetter in the future.\u201d They passed out together\nwith their arms linked in friendly fashion. The\ninspector remained, staring at me in silence with\nhis ox-like eyes. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve done it!\u201d he cried at last. \u201cI had\nread of you, but I never believed it. It\u2019s wonder-\nful!\u201d\nI was forced to shake my head. To accept such\npraise was to lower one\u2019s own standards. \u201cI was slow at the outset\u2014culpably slow. Had\nthe body been found in the water I could hardly\nhave missed it. It was the towel which misled me. The poor fellow had never thought to dry him-\nself, and so I in turn was led to believe that he\nhad never been in the water. Why, then, should\nthe attack of any water creature suggest itself to\nme? That was where I went astray. Well, well, In-\nspector, I often ventured to chaff you gentlemen of\nthe police force, but Cyanea capillata very nearly\navenged Scotland Yard.\u201d\nThe Adventure of the Veiled Lodger\nThe Adventure of the Veiled Lodger\nW\nhen one considers that Mr. Sher-\nlock Holmes was in active practice for\ntwenty-three years, and that during\nseventeen of these I was allowed to co-\noperate with him and to keep notes of his doings,\nit will be clear that I have a mass of material at my\ncommand."

        "text": "The problem has always been not to\n\ufb01nd but to choose. There is the long row of year-\nbooks which \ufb01ll a shelf, and there are the dispatch-\ncases \ufb01lled with documents, a perfect quarry for\nthe student not only of crime but of the social and\nof\ufb01cial scandals of the late Victorian era. Concern-\ning these latter, I may say that the writers of ag-\nonized letters, who beg that the honour of their\nfamilies or the reputation of famous forebears may\nnot be touched, have nothing to fear. The discre-\ntion and high sense of professional honour which\nhave always distinguished my friend are still at\nwork in the choice of these memoirs, and no con-\n\ufb01dence will be abused. I deprecate, however, in\nthe strongest way the attempts which have been\nmade lately to get at and to destroy these papers. The source of these outrages is known, and if they\nare repeated I have Mr. Holmes\u2019s authority for say-\ning that the whole story concerning the politician,\nthe lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be\ngiven to the public. There is at least one reader\nwho will understand. It is not reasonable to suppose that every one of\nthese cases gave Holmes the opportunity of show-\ning those curious gifts of instinct and observation\nwhich I have endeavoured to set forth in these\nmemoirs. Sometimes he had with much effort\nto pick the fruit, sometimes it fell easily into his\nlap. But the most terrible human tragedies were\noften involved in those cases which brought him\nthe fewest personal opportunities, and it is one of\nthese which I now desire to record. In telling it, I\nhave made a slight change of name and place, but\notherwise the facts are as stated. One forenoon\u2014it was late in 1896\u2014I received\na hurried note from Holmes asking for my atten-\ndance. When I arrived I found him seated in a\nsmoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, moth-\nerly woman of the buxom landlady type in the\ncorresponding chair in front of him. \u201cThis is Mrs. Merrilow, of South Brixton,\u201d said\nmy friend with a wave of the hand. \u201cMrs. Mer-\nrilow does not object to tobacco, Watson, if you\nwish to indulge your \ufb01lthy habits. Mrs. Merrilow\nhas an interesting story to tell which may well lead\nto further developments in which your presence\nmay be useful.\u201d\n\u201cAnything I can do\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou will understand, Mrs. Merrilow, that if I\ncome to Mrs. Ronder I should prefer to have a wit-\nness. You will make her understand that before we\narrive.\u201d\n\u201cLord bless you, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said our visi-\ntor, \u201cshe is that anxious to see you that you might\nbring the whole parish at your heels!\u201d\n\u201cThen we shall come early in the afternoon. Let\nus see that we have our facts correct before we\nstart. If we go over them it will help Dr. Watson to\nunderstand the situation. You say that Mrs. Ron-\nder has been your lodger for seven years and that\nyou have only once seen her face.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I wish to God I had not!\u201d said Mrs. Mer-\nrilow."

When I saw her\u2014I happened on her un-\nawares\u2014she covered up quick, and then she said,\n\u2018Now, Mrs. Merrilow, you know at last why it is\nthat I never raise my veil.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cDo you know anything about her history?\u201d\n\u201cNothing at all.\u201d\n\u201cDid she give references when she came?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, but she gave hard cash, and plenty of\nit.

In these times\na poor woman like me can\u2019t afford to turn down a\nchance like that.\u201d\n\u201cDid she give any reason for choosing your\nhouse?\u201d\n\u201cMine stands well back from the road and is\nmore private than most.

You monster!\u2019\n959\nThe Adventure of the Veiled Lodger\nshe cried. It was in the night, and it fair rang\nthrough the house and sent the shivers through\nme. So I went to her in the morning. \u2018Mrs. Ron-\nder,\u2019 I says, \u2018if you have anything that is troubling\nyour soul, there\u2019s the clergy,\u2019 I says, \u2018and there\u2019s\nthe police. Between them you should get some\nhelp.\u2019 \u2018For God\u2019s sake, not the police!\u2019 says she,\n\u2018and the clergy can\u2019t change what is past. And\nyet,\u2019 she says, \u2018it would ease my mind if someone\nknew the truth before I died.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 says I, \u2018if you\nwon\u2019t have the regulars, there is this detective man\nwhat we read about\u2019\u2014beggin\u2019 your pardon, Mr.\nHolmes. And she, she fair jumped at it. \u2018That\u2019s\nthe man,\u2019 says she. \u2018I wonder I never thought of\nit before. Bring him here, Mrs. Merrilow, and if\nhe won\u2019t come, tell him I am the wife of Ronder\u2019s\nwild beast show. Say that, and give him the name\nAbbas Parva.

I should like to have a little\nchat with Dr. Watson. That will carry us till lunch-\ntime. About three o\u2019clock you may expect to see\nus at your house in Brixton.\u201d\nOur visitor had no sooner waddled out of the\nroom\u2014no other verb can describe Mrs. Merrilow\u2019s\nmethod of progression\u2014than Sherlock Holmes\nthrew himself with \ufb01erce energy upon the pile of\ncommonplace books in the corner. For a few min-\nutes there was a constant swish of the leaves, and\nthen with a grunt of satisfaction he came upon\nwhat he sought. So excited was he that he did not\nrise, but sat upon the \ufb02oor like some strange Bud-\ndha, with crossed legs, the huge books all round\nhim, and one open upon his knees. \u201cThe case worried me at the time, Watson. Here are my marginal notes to prove it. I confess\nthat I could make nothing of it. And yet I was con-\nvinced that the coroner was wrong. Have you no\nrecollection of the Abbas Parva tragedy?\u201d\n\u201cNone, Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you were with me then. But certainly\nmy own impression was very super\ufb01cial. For there\nwas nothing to go by, and none of the parties had\nengaged my services. Perhaps you would care to\nread the papers?\u201d\n\u201cCould you not give me the points?\u201d\n\u201cThat is very easily done. It will probably come\nback to your memory as I talk. Ronder, of course,\nwas a household word. He was the rival of Womb-\nwell, and of Sanger, one of the greatest showmen\nof his day. There is evidence, however, that he took\nto drink, and that both he and his show were on\nthe down grade at the time of the great tragedy. The caravan had halted for the night at Abbas\nParva, which is a small village in Berkshire, when\nthis horror occurred. They were on their way to\nWimbledon, travelling by road, and they were sim-\nply camping and not exhibiting, as the place is so\nsmall a one that it would not have paid them to\nopen. \u201cThey had among their exhibits a very \ufb01ne\nNorth African lion. Sahara King was its name, and\nit was the habit, both of Ronder and his wife, to\ngive exhibitions inside its cage. Here, you see, is a\nphotograph of the performance by which you will\nperceive that Ronder was a huge porcine person\nand that his wife was a very magni\ufb01cent woman. It was deposed at the inquest that there had been\nsome signs that the lion was dangerous, but, as\nusual, familiarity begat contempt, and no notice\nwas taken of the fact. \u201cIt was usual for either Ronder or his wife to\nfeed the lion at night. Sometimes one went, some-\ntimes both, but they never allowed anyone else to\ndo it, for they believed that so long as they were\nthe food-carriers he would regard them as bene-\nfactors and would never molest them."

        "text": "On this par-\nticular night, seven years ago, they both went, and\na very terrible happening followed, the details of\nwhich have never been made clear. \u201cIt seems that the whole camp was roused\nnear midnight by the roars of the animal and\nthe screams of the woman. The different grooms\nand employees rushed from their tents, carrying\nlanterns, and by their light an awful sight was\nrevealed. Ronder lay, with the back of his head\ncrushed in and deep claw-marks across his scalp,\nsome ten yards from the cage, which was open. Close to the door of the cage lay Mrs. Ronder upon\nher back, with the creature squatting and snarling\nabove her. It had torn her face in such a fashion\nthat it was never thought that she could live. Sev-\neral of the circus men, headed by Leonardo, the\nstrong man, and Griggs, the clown, drove the crea-\nture off with poles, upon which it sprang back\ninto the cage and was at once locked in. How it\nhad got loose was a mystery. It was conjectured\nthat the pair intended to enter the cage, but that\nwhen the door was loosed the creature bounded\nout upon them. There was no other point of inter-\nest in the evidence save that the woman in a delir-\nium of agony kept screaming, \u2018Coward! Coward!\u2019\nas she was carried back to the van in which they\nlived. It was six months before she was \ufb01t to give\nevidence, but the inquest was duly held, with the\nobvious verdict of death from misadventure.\u201d\n960\nThe Adventure of the Veiled Lodger\n\u201cWhat alternative could be conceived?\u201d said I. \u201cYou may well say so. And yet there were one\nor two points which worried young Edmunds, of\nthe Berkshire Constabulary. A smart lad that! He\nwas sent later to Allahabad. That was how I came\ninto the matter, for he dropped in and smoked a\npipe or two over it.\u201d\n\u201cA thin, yellow-haired man?\u201d\n\u201cExactly. I was sure you would pick up the trail\npresently.\u201d\n\u201cBut what worried him?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we were both worried. It was so\ndeucedly dif\ufb01cult to reconstruct the affair. Look\nat it from the lion\u2019s point of view. He is liberated. What does he do? He takes half a dozen bounds\nforward, which brings him to Ronder. Ronder\nturns to \ufb02y\u2014the claw-marks were on the back of\nhis head\u2014but the lion strikes him down. Then,\ninstead of bounding on and escaping, he returns\nto the woman, who was close to the cage, and\nhe knocks her over and chews her face up. Then,\nagain, those cries of hers would seem to imply that\nher husband had in some way failed her. What\ncould the poor devil have done to help her? You\nsee the dif\ufb01culty?\u201d\n\u201cQuite.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then there was another thing. It comes\nback to me now as I think it over. There was some\nevidence that just at the time the lion roared and\nthe woman screamed, a man began shouting in ter-\nror.\u201d\n\u201cThis man Ronder, no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if his skull was smashed in you would\nhardly expect to hear from him again."

The man turned\nand was struck down. The woman conceived the\nidea of getting into the cage and shutting the door. It was her only refuge. She made for it, and just\nas she reached it the beast bounded after her and\nknocked her over. She was angry with her hus-\nband for having encouraged the beast\u2019s rage by\nturning.

Ronder was a man of many enemies. Ed-\nmunds told me that in his cups he was horrible. A huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed\nat everyone who came in his way. I expect those\ncries about a monster, of which our visitor has spo-\nken, were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear de-\nparted. However, our speculations are futile until\nwe have all the facts. There is a cold partridge on\nthe sideboard, Watson, and a bottle of Montrachet. Let us renew our energies before we make a fresh\ncall upon them.\u201d\nWhen our hansom deposited us at the house of\nMrs. Merrilow, we found that plump lady block-\ning up the open door of her humble but retired\nabode. It was very clear that her chief preoccupa-\ntion was lest she should lose a valuable lodger, and\nshe implored us, before showing us up, to say and\ndo nothing which could lead to so undesirable an\nend. Then, having reassured her, we followed her\nup the straight, badly carpeted staircase and were\nshown into the room of the mysterious lodger. It was a close, musty, ill-ventilated place, as\nmight be expected, since its inmate seldom left it. From keeping beasts in a cage, the woman seemed,\nby some retribution of fate, to have become herself\na beast in a cage. She sat now in a broken armchair\nin the shadowy corner of the room. Long years of\ninaction had coarsened the lines of her \ufb01gure, but\nat some period it must have been beautiful, and\nwas still full and voluptuous."

I was a poor circus girl\nbrought up on the sawdust, and doing springs\nthrough the hoop before I was ten. When I became\na woman this man loved me, if such lust as his can\nbe called love, and in an evil moment I became his\nwife. From that day I was in hell, and he the devil\nwho tormented me. There was no one in the show\nwho did not know of his treatment. He deserted\nme for others. He tied me down and lashed me\nwith his riding-whip when I complained. They all\npitied me and they all loathed him, but what could\nthey do? They feared him, one and all. For he was\nterrible at all times, and murderous when he was\ndrunk. Again and again he was had up for assault,\nand for cruelty to the beasts, but he had plenty of\nmoney and the \ufb01nes were nothing to him. The best\nmen all left us, and the show began to go downhill. It was only Leonardo and I who kept it up\u2014with\nlittle Jimmy Griggs, the clown. Poor devil, he had\nnot much to be funny about, but he did what he\ncould to hold things together. \u201cThen Leonardo came more and more into my\nlife. You see what he was like. I know now the\npoor spirit that was hidden in that splendid body,\nbut compared to my husband he seemed like the\nangel Gabriel. He pitied me and helped me, till\nat last our intimacy turned to love\u2014deep, deep,\npassionate love, such love as I had dreamed of but\nnever hoped to feel. My husband suspected it, but\nI think that he was a coward as well as a bully, and\nthat Leonardo was the one man that he was afraid\nof. He took revenge in his own way by torturing\nme more than ever. One night my cries brought\nLeonardo to the door of our van. We were near\ntragedy that night, and soon my lover and I un-\nderstood that it could not be avoided. My husband\nwas not \ufb01t to live. We planned that he should die. \u201cLeonardo had a clever, scheming brain. It was\nhe who planned it. I do not say that to blame him,\nfor I was ready to go with him every inch of the\nway. But I should never have had the wit to think\nof such a plan. We made a club\u2014Leonardo made\nit\u2014and in the leaden head he fastened \ufb01ve long\nsteel nails, the points outward, with just such a\nspread as the lion\u2019s paw. This was to give my hus-\nband his death-blow, and yet to leave the evidence\nthat it was the lion which we would loose who had\ndone the deed. \u201cIt was a pitch-dark night when my husband\nand I went down, as was our custom, to feed the\nbeast."

My heart leaped with joy at\nthe sound. I sprang forward, and I undid the catch\nwhich held the door of the great lion\u2019s cage. \u201cAnd then the terrible thing happened. You\nmay have heard how quick these creatures are to\nscent human blood, and how it excites them. Some\nstrange instinct had told the creature in one instant\nthat a human being had been slain. As I slipped\nthe bars it bounded out and was on me in an in-\nstant. Leonardo could have saved me. If he had\nrushed forward and struck the beast with his club\nhe might have cowed it. But the man lost his nerve. I heard him shout in his terror, and then I saw him\nturn and \ufb02y. At the same instant the teeth of the\nlion met in my face. Its hot, \ufb01lthy breath had al-\nready poisoned me and I was hardly conscious of\npain. With the palms of my hands I tried to push\nthe great steaming, blood-stained jaws away from\nme, and I screamed for help. I was conscious that\nthe camp was stirring, and then dimly I remem-\nbered a group of men. Leonardo, Griggs, and oth-\ners, dragging me from under the creature\u2019s paws. That was my last memory, Mr. Holmes, for many\na weary month. When I came to myself and saw\nmyself in the mirror, I cursed that lion\u2014oh, how\nI cursed him!\u2014not because he had torn away my\nbeauty but because he had not torn away my life. I\nhad but one desire, Mr. Holmes, and I had enough\nmoney to gratify it. It was that I should cover my-\nself so that my poor face should be seen by none,\nand that I should dwell where none whom I had\never known should \ufb01nd me. That was all that was\nleft to me to do\u2014and that is what I have done. A\npoor wounded beast that has crawled into its hole\nto die\u2014that is the end of Eugenia Ronder.\u201d\nWe sat in silence for some time after the un-\nhappy woman had told her story. Then Holmes\nstretched out his long arm and patted her hand\nwith such a show of sympathy as I had seldom\nknown him to exhibit. \u201cPoor girl!\u201d he said. \u201cPoor girl! The ways of\nfate are indeed hard to understand. If there is not\nsome compensation hereafter, then the world is a\ncruel jest. But what of this man Leonardo?\u201d\n\u201cI never saw him or heard from him again. Per-\nhaps I have been wrong to feel so bitterly against\nhim. He might as soon have loved one of the freaks\nwhom we carried round the country as the thing\nwhich the lion had left."

The example of patient suf-\nfering is in itself the most precious of all lessons to\nan impatient world.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s answer was a terrible one. She\nraised her veil and stepped forward into the light. \u201cI wonder if you would bear it,\u201d she said. It was horrible. No words can describe the\nframework of a face when the face itself is gone. Two living and beautiful brown eyes looking sadly\nout from that grisly ruin did but make the view\nmore awful. Holmes held up his hand in a gesture\nof pity and protest, and together we left the room. Two days later, when I called upon my friend,\nhe pointed with some pride to a small blue bottle\nupon his mantelpiece. I picked it up. There was a\nred poison label. A pleasant almondy odour rose\nwhen I opened it. \u201cPrussic acid?\u201d said I. \u201cExactly. It came by post. \u2018I send you my temp-\ntation.

He is about the most daredevil rider in Eng-\nland\u2014second in the Grand National a few years\nback. He is one of those men who have overshot\ntheir true generation. He should have been a buck\nin the days of the Regency\u2014a boxer, an athlete, a\nplunger on the turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by\nall account, so far down Queer Street that he may\nnever \ufb01nd his way back again.\u201d\n\u201cCapital, Watson!

You need not look surprised at my knowl-\nedge, Watson, for this is a letter from him which\nI am unfolding. But let us have some more about\nShoscombe. I seem to have struck a rich vein.\u201d\n\u201cThere are the Shoscombe spaniels,\u201d said I. \u201cYou hear of them at every dog show. The most\nexclusive breed in England. They are the special\npride of the lady of Shoscombe Old Place.\u201d\n\u201cSir Robert Norberton\u2019s wife, I presume!\u201d\n\u201cSir Robert has never married. Just as well, I\nthink, considering his prospects. He lives with his\nwidowed sister, Lady Beatrice Falder.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that she lives with him?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. The place belonged to her late hus-\nband, Sir James. Norberton has no claim on it at\nall. It is only a life interest and reverts to her hus-\nband\u2019s brother. Meantime, she draws the rents ev-\nery year.\u201d\n\u201cAnd brother Robert, I suppose, spends the\nsaid rents?\u201d\n\u201cThat is about the size of it."

Mr. John Ma-\nson had many of both under his sway, and he\nlooked equal to the task. He bowed with cold self-\npossession and seated himself upon the chair to\nwhich Holmes had waved him. \u201cYou had my note, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but it explained nothing.\u201d\n\u201cIt was too delicate a thing for me to put the de-\ntails on paper. And too complicated. It was only\nface to face I could do it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we are at your disposal.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, Mr. Holmes, I think that my em-\nployer, Sir Robert, has gone mad.\u201d\n967\nThe Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\nHolmes raised his eyebrows. \u201cThis is Baker\nStreet, not Harley Street,\u201d said he. \u201cBut why do\nyou say so?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, when a man does one queer thing,\nor two queer things, there may be a meaning to\nit, but when everything he does is queer, then you\nbegin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and\nthe Derby have turned his brain.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a colt you are running?\u201d\n\u201cThe best in England, Mr. Holmes. I should\nknow, if anyone does. Now, I\u2019ll be plain with you,\nfor I know you are gentlemen of honour and that\nit won\u2019t go beyond the room. Sir Robert has got to\nwin this Derby. He\u2019s up to the neck, and it\u2019s his\nlast chance. Everything he could raise or borrow\nis on the horse\u2014and at \ufb01ne odds, too! You can get\nforties now, but it was nearer the hundred when\nhe began to back him.\u201d\n\u201cBut how is that if the horse is so good?\u201d\n\u201cThe public don\u2019t know how good he is. Sir\nRobert has been too clever for the touts. He has\nthe Prince\u2019s half-brother out for spins. You can\u2019t\ntell \u2019em apart. But there are two lengths in a fur-\nlong between them when it comes to a gallop. He\nthinks of nothing but the horse and the race. His\nwhole life is on it. He\u2019s holding off the Jews till\nthen. If the Prince fails him he is done.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems a rather desperate gamble, but where\ndoes the madness come in?\u201d\n\u201cWell, \ufb01rst of all, you have only to look at him. I don\u2019t believe he sleeps at night. He is down at\nthe stables at all hours. His eyes are wild. It has\nall been too much for his nerves. Then there is his\nconduct to Lady Beatrice!\u201d\n\u201cAh! What is that?\u201d\n\u201cThey have always been the best of friends."

But that\u2019s\nall over now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWell, she seems to have lost all interest in the\nhorses.

He\u2019s a terrible man with his\n\ufb01sts if he gets started, and no respecter of persons. So we were shy of getting too near, but we marked\nhim down all right. It was the haunted crypt that\nhe was making for, and there was a man waiting\nfor him there.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this haunted crypt?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the\npark. It is so old that nobody could \ufb01x its date. And under it there\u2019s a crypt which has a bad name\namong us. It\u2019s a dark, damp, lonely place by day,\nbut there are few in that county that would have\nthe nerve to go near it at night. But master\u2019s not\nafraid. He never feared anything in his life.

Just two weary Londoners who\nbadly need some good Berkshire air.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you are in the right place for that. There\nis a deal of it lying about. But mind what I have\ntold you about Sir Robert. He\u2019s the sort that strikes\n\ufb01rst and speaks afterwards. Keep clear of the\npark.\u201d\n\u201cSurely, Mr. Barnes! We certainly shall. By the\nway, that was a most beautiful spaniel that was\nwhining in the hall.\u201d\n\u201cI should say it was. That was the real\nShoscombe breed. There ain\u2019t a better in England.\u201d\n\u201cI am a dog-fancier myself,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, if it is a fair question, what would a prize\ndog like that cost?\u201d\n\u201cMore than I could pay, sir. It was Sir Robert\nhimself who gave me this one. That\u2019s why I have\nto keep it on a lead."

By the way, Sir Robert is\nstill in London, I hear. We might, perhaps, enter\nthe sacred domain to-night without fear of bodily\nassault. There are one or two points on which I\nshould like reassurance.\u201d\n\u201cHave you any theory, Holmes?\u201d\n\u201cOnly this, Watson, that something happened\na week or so ago which has cut deep into the\nlife of the Shoscombe household. What is that\nsomething? We can only guess at it from its ef-\nfects. They seem to be of a curiously mixed char-\nacter. But that should surely help us. It is only the\ncolourless, uneventful case which is hopeless. \u201cLet us consider our data. The brother no\nlonger visits the beloved invalid sister. He gives\naway her favourite dog. Her dog, Watson! Does\nthat suggest nothing to you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing but the brother\u2019s spite.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it might be so. Or\u2014well, there is an al-\nternative. Now to continue our review of the sit-\nuation from the time that the quarrel, if there is\n970\nThe Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\na quarrel, began. The lady keeps her room, al-\nters her habits, is not seen save when she drives\nout with her maid, refuses to stop at the stables to\ngreet her favourite horse, and apparently takes to\ndrink. That covers the case, does it not?\u201d\n\u201cSave for the business in the crypt.\u201d\n\u201cThat is another line of thought. There are\ntwo, and I beg you will not tangle them. Line A,\nwhich concerns Lady Beatrice, has a vaguely sinis-\nter \ufb02avour, has it not?\u201d\n\u201cI can make nothing of it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, now, let us take up line B, which con-\ncerns Sir Robert. He is mad keen upon winning\nthe Derby. He is in the hands of the Jews, and may\nat any moment be sold up and his racing stables\nseized by his creditors. He is a daring and desper-\nate man. He derives his income from his sister. His\nsister\u2019s maid is his willing tool. So far we seem to\nbe on fairly safe ground, do we not?\u201d\n\u201cBut the crypt?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, the crypt! Let us suppose, Watson\u2014it\nis merely a scandalous supposition, a hypothesis\nput forward for argument\u2019s sake\u2014that Sir Robert\nhas done away with his sister.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes, it is out of the question.\u201d\n\u201cVery possibly, Watson. Sir Robert is a man of\nan honourable stock. But you do occasionally \ufb01nd\na carrion crow among the eagles. Let us for a mo-\nment argue upon this supposition. He could not\n\ufb02y the country until he had realized his fortune,\nand that fortune could only be realized by bringing\noff this coup with Shoscombe Prince. Therefore, he\nhas still to stand his ground."

The woman\u2019s body\nmight be conveyed to the crypt, which is a place so\nseldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed\nat night in the furnace, leaving behind it such ev-\nidence as we have already seen. What say you to\nthat, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is all possible if you grant the original\nmonstrous supposition.\u201d\n\u201cI think that there is a small experiment which\nwe may try to-morrow, Watson, in order to throw\nsome light on the matter. Meanwhile, if we mean\nto keep up our characters, I suggest that we have\nour host in for a glass of his own wine and hold\nsome high converse upon eels and dace, which\nseems to be the straight road to his affections. We\nmay chance to come upon some useful local gossip\nin the process.\u201d\nIn the morning Holmes discovered that we had\ncome without our spoon-bait for jack, which ab-\nsolved us from \ufb01shing for the day. About eleven\no\u2019clock we started for a walk, and he obtained\nleave to take the black spaniel with us. \u201cThis is the place,\u201d said he as we came to\ntwo high park gates with heraldic grif\ufb01ns tower-\ning above them. \u201cAbout midday, Mr. Barnes in-\nforms me, the old lady takes a drive, and the car-\nriage must slow down while the gates are opened.

I shall stand\nbehind this holly-bush and see what I can see.\u201d\nIt was not a long vigil. Within a quarter of\nan hour we saw the big open yellow barouche\ncoming down the long avenue, with two splendid,\nhigh-stepping gray carriage horses in the shafts. Holmes crouched behind his bush with the dog. I\nstood unconcernedly swinging a cane in the road-\nway. A keeper ran out and the gates swung open. The carriage had slowed to a walk, and I was\nable to get a good look at the occupants. A highly\ncoloured young woman with \ufb02axen hair and im-\npudent eyes sat on the left. At her right was an\nelderly person with rounded back and a huddle of\nshawls about her face and shoulders which pro-\nclaimed the invalid. When the horses reached the\nhighroad I held up my hand with an authoritative\ngesture, and as the coachman pulled up I inquired\nif Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place. At the same moment Holmes stepped out and\nreleased the spaniel. With a joyous cry it dashed\nforward to the carriage and sprang upon the step. Then in a moment its eager greeting changed to fu-\nrious rage, and it snapped at the black skirt above\nit. \u201cDrive on! Drive on!\u201d shrieked a harsh voice."

It was\nonly after that meal that Holmes showed signs of\n971\nThe Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\nrenewed activity. Once more we found ourselves\nupon the same road as in the morning, which led\nus to the park gates. A tall, dark \ufb01gure was await-\ning us there, who proved to be our London ac-\nquaintance, Mr. John Mason, the trainer. \u201cGood-evening, gentlemen,\u201d said he. \u201cI got\nyour note, Mr. Holmes. Sir Robert has not returned\nyet, but I hear that he is expected to-night.\u201d\n\u201cHow far is this crypt from the house?\u201d asked\nHolmes. \u201cA good quarter of a mile.\u201d\n\u201cThen I think we can disregard him alto-\ngether.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to do that, Mr. Holmes.

We entered the broken gap which\nwas once the porch, and our guide, stumbling\namong heaps of loose masonry, picked his way\nto the corner of the building, where a steep stair\nled down into the crypt. Striking a match, he il-\nluminated the melancholy place\u2014dismal and evil-\nsmelling, with ancient crumbling walls of rough-\nhewn stone, and piles of cof\ufb01ns, some of lead and\nsome of stone, extending upon one side right up\nto the arched and groined roof which lost itself in\nthe shadows above our heads. Holmes had lit his\nlantern, which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow\nlight upon the mournful scene. Its rays were re-\n\ufb02ected back from the cof\ufb01n-plates, many of them\nadorned with the grif\ufb01n and coronet of this old\nfamily which carried its honours even to the gate\nof Death. \u201cYou spoke of some bones, Mr. Mason. Could\nyou show them before you go?\u201d\n\u201cThey are here in this corner.\u201d The trainer\nstrode across and then stood in silent surprise as\nour light was turned upon the place. \u201cThey are\ngone,\u201d said he. \u201cSo I expected,\u201d said Holmes, chuckling. \u201cI\nfancy the ashes of them might even now be found\nin that oven which had already consumed a part.\u201d\n\u201cBut why in the world would anyone want to\nburn the bones of a man who has been dead a\nthousand years?\u201d asked John Mason."

It\nwas the \ufb01rm, rapid step of one who came with a\nde\ufb01nite purpose and knew well the ground upon\nwhich he walked. A light streamed down the\nstairs, and an instant later the man who bore it\nwas framed in the Gothic archway. He was a terri-\nble \ufb01gure, huge in stature and \ufb01erce in manner.

I should not have known which was\nThe Haven had I not asked a lounger who was\nsmoking in the street. I have a reason for mention-\ning him. He was a tall, dark, heavily moustached,\nrather military-looking man. He nodded in answer\n977\nThe Adventure of the Retired Colourman\nto my inquiry and gave me a curiously question-\ning glance, which came back to my memory a little\nlater."

I only had\na glimpse of him this morning, and he certainly\ngave me the impression of a strange creature, but\nwhen I saw him in full light his appearance was\neven more abnormal.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\nof course,\nstudied it,\nand yet I\nshould be interested to have your impression,\u201d\nsaid Holmes. \u201cHe seemed to me like a man who was liter-\nally bowed down by care. His back was curved\nas though he carried a heavy burden. Yet he was\nnot the weakling that I had at \ufb01rst imagined, for\nhis shoulders and chest have the framework of a\ngiant, though his \ufb01gure tapers away into a pair of\nspindled legs.\u201d\n\u201cLeft shoe wrinkled, right one smooth.\u201d\n\u201cI did not observe that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. I spotted his arti\ufb01cial limb. But proceed.\u201d\n\u201cI was struck by the snaky locks of grizzled\nhair which curled from under his old straw hat,\nand his face with its \ufb01erce, eager expression and\nthe deeply lined features.\u201d\n\u201cVery good, Watson. What did he say?\u201d\n\u201cHe began pouring out the story of his\ngrievances. We walked down the drive together,\nand of course I took a good look round. I have\nnever seen a worse-kept place. The garden was all\nrunning to seed, giving me an impression of wild\nneglect in which the plants had been allowed to\n\ufb01nd the way of Nature rather than of art. How any\ndecent woman could have tolerated such a state of\nthings, I don\u2019t know. The house, too, was slatternly\nto the last degree, but the poor man seemed him-\nself to be aware of it and to be trying to remedy it,\nfor a great pot of green paint stood in the centre of\nthe hall, and he was carrying a thick brush in his\nleft hand. He had been working on the woodwork. \u201cHe took me into his dingy sanctum, and we\nhad a long chat. Of course, he was disappointed\nthat you had not come yourself. \u2018I hardly ex-\npected,\u2019 he said, \u2018that so humble an individual as\nmyself, especially after my heavy \ufb01nancial loss,\ncould obtain the complete attention of so famous a\nman as Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\u2019\n\u201cI assured him that the \ufb01nancial question did\nnot arise. \u2018No, of course, it is art for art\u2019s sake\nwith him,\u2019 said he, \u2018but even on the artistic side\nof crime he might have found something here to\nstudy. And human nature, Dr. Watson\u2014the black\ningratitude of it all! When did I ever refuse one of\nher requests? Was ever a woman so pampered? And that young man\u2014he might have been my\nown son. He had the run of my house. And yet\nsee how they have treated me! Oh, Dr. Watson, it\nis a dreadful, dreadful world!\u2019\n\u201cThat was the burden of his song for an hour\nor more. He had, it seems, no suspicion of an in-\ntrigue."

On that particular evening old Amberley,\nwishing to give his wife a treat, had taken two up-\nper circle seats at the Haymarket Theatre. At the\nlast moment she had complained of a headache\nand had refused to go. He had gone alone. There\nseemed to be no doubt about the fact, for he pro-\nduced the unused ticket which he had taken for\nhis wife.\u201d\n\u201cThat is remarkable\u2014most remarkable,\u201d said\nHolmes, whose interest in the case seemed to be\nrising. \u201cPray continue, Watson. I \ufb01nd your narra-\ntive most arresting. Did you personally examine\nthis ticket? You did not, perchance, take the num-\nber?\u201d\n\u201cIt so happens that I did,\u201d I answered with\nsome pride. \u201cIt chanced to be my old school num-\nber, thirty-one, and so is stuck in my head.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent, Watson! His seat, then, was either\nthirty or thirty-two.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d I answered with some mysti\ufb01ca-\ntion. \u201cAnd on B row.\u201d\n\u201cThat is most satisfactory. What else did he tell\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cHe showed me his strong-room, as he called it. It really is a strong-room\u2014like a bank\u2014with iron\ndoor and shutter\u2014burglar-proof, as he claimed. However, the woman seems to have had a dupli-\ncate key, and between them they had carried off\nsome seven thousand pounds\u2019 worth of cash and\nsecurities.\u201d\n\u201cSecurities! How could they dispose of those?\u201d\n\u201cHe said that he had given the police a list\nand that he hoped they would be unsaleable. He\nhad got back from the theatre about midnight and\nfound the place plundered, the door and window\nopen, and the fugitives gone. There was no letter\nor message, nor has he heard a word since. He at\nonce gave the alarm to the police.\u201d\nHolmes brooded for some minutes. \u201cYou say he was painting. What was he paint-\ning?\u201d\n978\nThe Adventure of the Retired Colourman\n\u201cWell, he was painting the passage. But he had\nalready painted the door and woodwork of this\nroom I spoke of.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it not strike you as a strange occupation\nin the circumstances?\u201d\n\u201c \u2018One must do something to ease an aching\nheart.\u2019 That was his own explanation. It was eccen-\ntric, no doubt, but he is clearly an eccentric man. He tore up one of his wife\u2019s photographs in my\npresence\u2014tore it up furiously in a tempest of pas-\nsion. \u2018I never wish to see her damned face again,\u2019\nhe shrieked.\u201d\n\u201cAnything more, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cYes, one thing which struck me more than\nanything else. I had driven to the Blackheath Sta-\ntion and had caught my train there when, just as\nit was starting, I saw a man dart into the carriage\nnext to my own. You know that I have a quick\neye for faces, Holmes. It was undoubtedly the tall,\ndark man whom I had addressed in the street. I\nsaw him once more at London Bridge, and then I\nlost him in the crowd."

I must admit to you that\nthe case, which seemed to me to be so absurdly\nsimple as to be hardly worth my notice, is rapidly\nassuming a very different aspect. It is true that\nthough in your mission you have missed every-\nthing of importance, yet even those things which\nhave obtruded themselves upon your notice give\nrise to serious thought.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have I missed?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be hurt, my dear fellow. You know\nthat I am quite impersonal. No one else would\nhave done better. Some possibly not so well. But\nclearly you have missed some vital points. What\nis the opinion of the neighbours about this man\nAmberley and his wife? That surely is of impor-\ntance. What of Dr. Ernest? Was he the gay Lothario\none would expect? With your natural advantages,\nWatson, every lady is your helper and accomplice. What about the girl at the post-of\ufb01ce, or the wife\nof the greengrocer? I can picture you whispering\nsoft nothings with the young lady at the Blue An-\nchor, and receiving hard somethings in exchange. All this you have left undone.\u201d\n\u201cIt can still be done.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been done. Thanks to the telephone and\nthe help of the Yard, I can usually get my essentials\nwithout leaving this room. As a matter of fact, my\ninformation con\ufb01rms the man\u2019s story. He has the\nlocal repute of being a miser as well as a harsh\nand exacting husband. That he had a large sum\nof money in that strong-room of his is certain. So\nalso is it that young Dr. Ernest, an unmarried man,\nplayed chess with Amberley, and probably played\nthe fool with his wife. All this seems plain sailing,\nand one would think that there was no more to be\nsaid\u2014and yet!\u2014and yet!\u201d\n\u201cWhere lies the dif\ufb01culty?\u201d\n\u201cIn my imagination, perhaps. Well, leave it\nthere, Watson. Let us escape from this weary\nworkaday world by the side door of music. Ca-\nrina sings to-night at the Albert Hall, and we still\nhave time to dress, dine, and enjoy.\u201d\nIn the morning I was up betimes, but some\ntoast crumbs and two empty egg-shells told me\nthat my companion was earlier still. I found a\nscribbled note upon the table. Dear Watson:\nThere are one or two points of con-\ntact which I should wish to establish\nwith Mr. Josiah Amberley. When I have\ndone so we can dismiss the case\u2014or\nnot. I would only ask you to be on\nhand about three o\u2019clock, as I conceive\nit possible that I may want you. S.

Well, of course you will\nstart at once. This is evidently from a responsible\nperson, the vicar of the place. Where is my Crock-\nford? Yes, here we have him: \u2018J. C. Elman, M. A.,\nLiving of Moosmoor cum Little Purlington.\u2019 Look\nup the trains, Watson.\u201d\n\u201cThere is one at 5.20 from Liverpool Street.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. You had best go with him, Watson.

We should feel that you were not\nreally in earnest in this investigation.\u201d\nOur client seemed horri\ufb01ed at the suggestion. \u201cWhy, of course I shall go if you look at it in\nthat way,\u201d said he. \u201cOn the face of it, it seems ab-\nsurd to suppose that this person knows anything,\nbut if you think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI do think,\u201d said Holmes with emphasis, and\nso we were launched upon our journey. Holmes\ntook me aside before we left the room and gave\nme one word of counsel, which showed that he\nconsidered the matter to be of importance. \u201cWhat-\never you do, see that he really does go,\u201d said he. \u201cShould he break away or return, get to the near-\nest telephone exchange and send the single word\n\u2018Bolted.\u2019 I will arrange here that it shall reach me\nwherever I am.\u201d\nLittle Purlington is not an easy place to reach,\nfor it is on a branch line. My remembrance of the\njourney is not a pleasant one, for the weather was\nhot, the train slow, and my companion sullen and\nsilent, hardly talking at all save to make an oc-\ncasional sardonic remark as to the futility of our\nproceedings.

Meanwhile, I can see no possible object in\nprolonging this interview.\u201d\nSo Mr. Amberley and I found ourselves on the\nroadside in what seemed to me to be the most\nprimitive village in England. We made for the tele-\ngraph of\ufb01ce, but it was already closed.

It was soon apparent to me that my compan-\nion\u2019s reputation as a miser was not undeserved. He had grumbled at the expense of the journey,\nhad insisted upon travelling third-class, and was\nnow clamorous in his objections to the hotel bill. Next morning, when we did at last arrive in Lon-\ndon, it was hard to say which of us was in the\nworse humour. \u201cYou had best take Baker Street as we pass,\u201d\nsaid I. \u201cMr. Holmes may have some fresh instruc-\ntions.\u201d\n\u201cIf they are not worth more than the last ones\nthey are not of much use, \u201d said Amberley with a\n980\nThe Adventure of the Retired Colourman\nmalevolent scowl. None the less, he kept me com-\npany. I had already warned Holmes by telegram\nof the hour of our arrival, but we found a mes-\nsage waiting that he was at Lewisham and would\nexpect us there. That was a surprise, but an even\ngreater one was to \ufb01nd that he was not alone in\nthe sitting-room of our client. A stern-looking, im-\npassive man sat beside him, a dark man with gray-\ntinted glasses and a large Masonic pin projecting\nfrom his tie. \u201cThis is my friend Mr. Barker,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe has been interesting himself also in your busi-\nness, Mr. Josiah Amberley, though we have been\nworking independently."

It is a\nvery unusual one\u2014so much so that I think his des-\ntination is more likely to be Broadmoor than the\nscaffold. He has, to a high degree, the sort of mind\n981\nThe Adventure of the Retired Colourman\nwhich one associates with the mediaeval Italian\nnature rather than with the modern Briton. He was\na miserable miser who made his wife so wretched\nby his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey\nfor any adventurer. Such a one came upon the\nscene in the person of this chess-playing doctor. Amberley excelled at chess\u2014one mark, Watson, of\na scheming mind. Like all misers, he was a jeal-\nous man, and his jealousy became a frantic mania. Rightly or wrongly, he suspected an intrigue. He\ndetermined to have his revenge, and he planned it\nwith diabolical cleverness.

It set my\nfoot upon the trail. Why should this man at such a\ntime be \ufb01lling his house with strong odours? Obvi-\nously, to cover some other smell which he wished\nto conceal\u2014some guilty smell which would sug-\ngest suspicions. Then came the idea of a room\nsuch as you see here with iron door and shut-\nter\u2014a hermetically sealed room. Put those two\nfacts together, and whither do they lead?

Therefore, Amberley had not been\nto the theatre, and his alibi fell to the ground. He\nmade a bad slip when he allowed my astute friend\nto notice the number of the seat taken for his wife.

It seems that he had been engaged by Dr. Ray\nErnest\u2019s family to make some investigations and\nhad come to the same conclusion as to foul play. He had watched the house for some days and had\nspotted Dr. Watson as one of the obviously sus-\npicious characters who had called there."

Of course, I told him how\nmatters stood and we continued the case together.\u201d\n\u201cWhy him? Why not us?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it was in my mind to put that lit-\ntle test which answered so admirably. I fear you\nwould not have gone so far.\u201d\nThe inspector smiled. \u201cWell, maybe not. I understand that I have your\nword, Mr. Holmes, that you step right out of the\ncase now and that you turn all your results over to\nus.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, that is always my custom.\u201d\n\u201cWell, in the name of the force I thank you. It\nseems a clear case, as you put it, and there can\u2019t be\nmuch dif\ufb01culty over the bodies.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you a grim little bit of evidence,\u201d said\nHolmes, \u201cand I am sure Amberley himself never\n982\nThe Adventure of the Retired Colourman\nobserved it. You\u2019ll get results, Inspector, by al-\nways putting yourself in the other fellow\u2019s place,\nand thinking what you would do yourself. It takes\nsome imagination, but it pays. Now, we will sup-\npose that you were shut up in this little room, had\nnot two minutes to live, but wanted to get even\nwith the \ufb01end who was probably mocking at you\nfrom the other side of the door. What would you\ndo?\u201d\n\u201cWrite a message.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. You would like to tell people how\nyou died. No use writing on paper. That would be\nseen. If you wrote on the wall someone might rest\nupon it. Now, look here! Just above the skirting is\nscribbled with a purple indelible pencil: \u2018We we\u2014\u2019\nThat\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s only a foot above the ground. The\npoor devil was on the \ufb02oor dying when he wrote\nit. He lost his senses before he could \ufb01nish.\u201d\n\u201cHe was writing, \u2018We were murdered.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I read it. If you \ufb01nd an indelible\npencil on the body\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look out for it, you may be sure. But\nthose securities? Clearly there was no robbery at\nall. And yet he did possess those bonds. We veri-\n\ufb01ed that.\u201d\n\u201cYou may be sure he has them hidden in a safe\nplace. When the whole elopement had passed into\nhistory, he would suddenly discover them and an-\nnounce that the guilty couple had relented and\nsent back the plunder or had dropped it on the\nway.\u201d\n\u201cYou certainly seem to have met every dif\ufb01-\nculty,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cOf course, he was\nbound to call us in, but why he should have gone\nto you I can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cPure swank!\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cHe felt so\nclever and so sure of himself that he imagined no\none could touch him. He could say to any suspi-\ncious neighbour, \u2018Look at the steps I have taken. I\nhave consulted not only the police but even Sher-\nlock Holmes.\u2019 \u201d\nThe inspector laughed."
